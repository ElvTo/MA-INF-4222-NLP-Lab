It’s OK to continue at $10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.”The Fed is trying to determine whether the economy has shown recent signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or fundamental obstacles to growth. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 18-19 March in its first gathering led by chair Janet Yellen since she succeeded Ben S. Bernanke last month.New York Fed president William C. Dudley said on 7 March he sees a “reasonably favorable” outlook for the economy, even as high unemployment and low inflation warrant stimulus for a “considerable time.”The US employers added more workers than projected in February, data last week showed, indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from a weather-induced setback. The 175,000 gain in employment followed a revised 129,000 increase the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501241483022-0'); });No Whip-Saw
Improvement in the labour market is one reason the FOMC has trimmed monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in each of its past two meetings. The central bank in January reduced monthly bond purchases to $65 billion.Policy shouldn’t be “whip-sawed from month to month,” Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers. The numbers were “encouraging,” though they follow other data in the previous two months that were “weak,” he said.Yellen has pledged to press on with gradual reductions in so-called quantitative easing so long as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.The Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%. Labour department figures showed that joblessness rose to 6.7% in February from 6.6% the month before as more people entered the labour force and couldn’t find work.Plosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006. The bank’s district includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Bloomberg

3	"Published: Mar 10, 2014 8:11 a.m. ETByPARISn — The Federal Reserve may have to accelerate the pace of tapering to take into account the economic pickup currently ongoing in the U.S. and the improving forecast for the near future, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said Monday. “We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy,” Plosser told a panel in Paris. “Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts.” Based on the latest gross domestic product numbers, the U.S. economy accelerated its pace of expansion in the second half of 2013 from the first half. Real output showed growth of 3.3% from 1.8% in the first half. As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion. At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year. But Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough. “If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction,” Plosser said. He also raised concerns about how the Fed might ultimately reduce the size of its balance sheet without disrupting inflation or the economy. “Knock on wood it would all go very smoothly, but you never know,” he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech.

7	Reuters Staff3 Min ReadBANGALORE (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not stop sterilizing bond purchases it made at the height of the euro zone’s debt crisis, a majority of euro money market traders polled by Reuters said. The ECB bought bonds of some troubled peripheral countries through its Securities Market Programme (SMP) in an attempt to counter spiking yields as the crisis worsened. In order to keep the money supply stable and avoid fuelling inflation, it “sterilizes” the purchases by offering deposits equal in value to the government bonds it holds. Eighteen of 23 traders polled expected the central bank to continue doing that, while only five said it would stop. Some economists and investors had expected the ECB to announce a halt to sterilization at last Thursday’s monthly policy meeting, to boost excess liquidity in the financial system and help bring down interbank lending rates. In the event, it left interest rates on hold and unveiled no other measures to bolster the fragile euro zone recovery, and ECB chief Mario Draghi said the benefits of not sterilizing would be “relatively limited”. The poll predicted that banks will repay 4.0 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of the ECB’s three-year emergency loans next week, less than half the 11.4 billion euros they are set to return this week. The euro zone’s central bank pumped over a trillion euros into banks’ coffers in two long-term refinancing operations in December 2011 and February 2012 to help lenders ride out funding constraints. Banks have repaid a little more than half of those loans since January last year, helping push excess liquidity - cash beyond what lenders need to cover their day-to-day operations - down to levels seen before the twin ECB operations. This week’s repayments are more than six times the amount that was expected, accelerating the drain of extra cash out of the bloc’s financial system. When asked if the ECB would take steps to provide more liquidity, 14 of 24 traders said they would. Of those 14 traders who expect a boost, nine said it would come in six months, three in the next three months and the remaining two in a year. The regular survey showed banks are expected to borrow 90.0 billion euros at the weekly refinancing tender and 6.5 billion euros in a one-month operation. Eighty-seven billion euros is maturing this week for the one week tender and 6.5 billion euros for the one month.

8	"The European Union’s half-baked banking union could be made to work – even though it wasn’t strictly needed to solve the euro zone’s problems and what has been agreed isn’t what the designers wanted.The original advocates of banking union saw it as a way to prevent the euro collapsing during the dark days of early 2012. The idea was that a well-funded, euro-wide deposit insurance scheme would stop savers panicking. Meanwhile, if banks got into trouble, a strong euro-wide safety net would be able to bail them out.During the crisis, savers and investors lost faith in the ability of weak governments to rescue their banks. That’s why banking union enthusiasts wanted euro-wide support systems.In the end, what has emerged from the European policy factory is completely different. Germany latched onto a part of banking union that hadn’t previously got much attention, centralised supervision of banks, and nixed the idea of common deposit insurance. It didn’t want to be on the hook for bailing out other countries’ banks. Berlin also diluted the plan for a euro-wide safety net for bust banks – though the European Parliament is still trying to beef it up.Despite all this, banking union doesn’t have to be a disaster. To see this, it is important to understand why the euro zone doesn’t actually need one.In 2012 much was made of the “doom loop” that connected weak banks and weak governments. This had two elements: bust banks dragged down their governments if the latter had to bail them out; and bust states dragged down their banks if the latter had bought too many of their bonds.This doom loop was, and remains, a serious flaw. But it is a mistake to think the only way to cut the loop is by euro-wide bailouts. There are better alternatives.Look, first, at the problem of bust banks infecting their governments. This is only a problem if taxpayers have to rescue them. But who said governments should be in the business of bailing out banks? It is much better to make banks safe enough so that they don’t get in trouble in the first place; and, if they do, to require their investors to foot the bill.That, indeed, is the broad programme that governments around the globe have been pursuing for the past five years. It involves preventing credit bubbles, forcing banks to hold more capital, “bailing in” bondholders if they run out of equity and restructuring lenders so it is easy to close them down if necessary.The EU is doing all this too. But it didn’t require banking union to push it forward.That said, the ECB could speed up some of these initiatives.First, the central bank needs to work out how it is going to stop bubbles. In its new supervisory role, it will have what are known as “macroprudential” powers. This will allow it to tell national authorities to do things like jack up banks’ capital ratios if it fears credit is growing too strongly.The snag is too many cooks may spoil the broth, as there are multiple bodies with macroprudential responsibility for all or parts of the euro zone. Even the ECB will have two units – the new bank supervisor and its financial stability directorate. It needs to provide clarity over who is going to do what.Second, many banks don’t have enough debt that could be easily bailed in if they run out of equity. The solution is to require all banks to hold a minimum amount of bail-in debt, so that taxpayers don’t have to ride to the rescue.This can be done without banking union. Indeed, the Group of 20 nations has asked for a global proposal later this year. The ECB should use its influence to produce a robust proposal.Then there’s the matter of avoiding situations where banks are deemed too important to fail because their bankruptcy would cause havoc for the whole system – and so again have to be rescued. Part of the solution is to require lenders to draw up “resolution plans” that spell out exactly how they can be packed off to the knacker’s yard without too much contagion.Again, banking union is not required. But, as a result of it, the ECB will be responsible for vetting euro zone banks’ resolution plans. With luck, the central bank will be less susceptible than national supervisors to lobbying by national champions – and so force banks to restructure themselves if that is needed to stop the too big to fail phenomenon.Now look at the other half of the doom loop: how weak sovereigns infect their banks. Yet again, banking union per se does nothing to address that problem. It can only be dealt with if lenders are told they can’t hold more than a certain amount of their own governments’ bonds.The ECB would prefer to impose such limits as part of a global regime. The snag is that countries with their own currencies and central banks don’t have such a need to follow suit. So the ECB may, at some point, have to face going it alone.It won’t be easy for the ECB to bite these bullets. But it will need to, if the euro zone’s half-baked banking union is to be turned into something that is fit for purpose.

9	Reuters Staff6 Min Read* Countries grapple for deal to prevent embarrassing delay * Ministers to debate scheme to close banks * Much still up for grabs, including imposing investor losses By Jan Strupczewski and John O‘Donnell BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - European governments and lawmakers will try to reach a deal this week on how to wind down failing banks, clearing the way for a landmark reform as time runs out to win European Parliament approval before May elections. Negotiations are set to span days and may be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for euro zone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one pot of money to pay for it. “There will not be an outcome today or tomorrow, because the real negotiations will take place on Wednesday and days after that if necessary,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is chairing Monday’s meeting of euro ministers, told reporters, referring to talks with the European Parliament’s lawmakers. As he entered for the first day of talks with European counterparts, Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said he was optimistic agreement could be clinched. Talks on a new European agency to shut down failing banks, and on a fund to pay for such closures, need to be agreed before the last sitting of the European Parliament in mid-April. Failure to do so would delay the law by at least seven months, and probably more. It could also mean it is scrutinised by a new group of lawmakers with a higher count of eurosceptics, as such parties are expected to do well in the May poll. The banking union, and the clean-up of banks’ books that will accompany it, is intended to restore banks’ confidence in one another and boost lending across the currency bloc, helping foster growth in the 18 economies that use the euro. “This is a large scale political project which will allow countries to borrow at the same rate whether you are Spanish, Italian, German or French,” French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici told reporters. New lending has been throttled by banks’ efforts to raise capital and cut their risks in recession. The banking union is also supposed to break the vicious circle of indebted states and the banks that buy their debt, treated in law as ‘risk-free’ despite Greece’s default in all but name. Euro zone banks now hold about 1.75 trillion euros of government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to the European Central Bank. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the banking system is now on loan to governments. The biggest political reform since the launch of the euro currency, banking union also touches on sensitive issues for investors, including the imposition of losses on bondholders of failing banks. Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank will be the supervisor for euro zone banks, a role it takes on in November. In return for giving its blessing to the wider scheme, Germany wants to see losses imposed from that point onwards on bondholders and others who have backed troubled banks. Officials caution that a deal may not be possible this week and could be postponed until the end of the month. To further complicate matters, European governments disagree not only amongst themselves, but also with the European Parliament, which must give its blessing to the project before it can become law. At the heart of the dispute is the complex process of closing a bank. Countries are reluctant to cede authority to Brussels and want a laborious system of checks before any decision to shut a bank can be taken. EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the euro zone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that the decision must then be signed into law by the finance ministers. Under that scenario, if the ministers want to change the board’s decision, they also have to involve the European Commission and start a procedure so complex that it is doubtful it can be completed quickly. The European Parliament, on the other hand, wants no involvement of EU ministers, arguing it would politicise the process and make it cumbersome. It wants leave the final go-ahead to the more impartial European Commission. Parliament also wants the ECB - the supervisor of all banks - to be the only institution to declare a bank is failing. EU governments want the agency board and national authorities to have a say. Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the ‘resolution’ fund, used to cover the costs of shutting a bank, and how soon countries should be able to dip into the pot. The fund will be filled by euro zone banks and is slated to reach around 55 billion euros ($76 billion). Governments want the fund to reach full size over 10 years, while the parliament wants the fund to be fully available to all euro zone countries after just three years. Finally, policymakers must decide if they will allow this fund to borrow if it is short of cash, or if it should borrow from the euro zone bailout fund or receive state guarantees.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

10	4 Min ReadFRANKFURT, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s emphasis on slack in the euro zone economy at its March policy meeting shows it intends to keep interest rates low even if growth rates pick up, sending a dovish message. Investors, however, were disappointed by the ECB’s lack of action last week, when the bank published an inflation forecast for 2016 that sees price rises still far below its target for price stability of below but close to 2 percent. The euro rose against the dollar to a 2-1/2 year high after the ECB signalled no need for new economic stimulus and took a slightly more optimistic view of the recovery. That seemed to have drowned the dovish message the ECB intended to send. For the first time, the ECB in the opening statement to the post-meeting news conference alluded to “the high degree of unutilised capacity” in the euro zone economy as one of the reasons for subdued inflation extending into the medium term. “Our monetary policy stance will stay in place even after we see improvements in the economy,... because we have a stock of slack that is weighing on the economy,” ECB President Mario Draghi said. Ahead of the meeting, a growing minority of economists polled by Reuters said the ECB may be forced to print money this year to fight off deflation risks, while some had expected a cut in interest rates, below the record low of 0.25 percent. The fact that the ECB refrained from suspending the weekly withdrawal of money it spent on Greek and other governments’ bonds during the debt crisis - the least divisive “sterlisation” measure - suggests the ECB may have to take a big step next or none at all. Deutsche Bank, for example, now expects rates to remain at a record low of 0.25 percent throughout this year. “The ECB seems to be ‘hoping for the best’, and we have probably underestimated the limitations to the Governing Council’s room for manoeuvre on its policy instruments in the last few months,” said Gilles Moec, economist at Deutsche. Draghi said the benefits of a so-called sterilisation of bond purchases under its Securities Markets Programme were “relatively limited” because of the short maturity of the bonds still in the SMP portfolio, currently worth 175 billion euros ($242.58 billion). A programme to revive the market for securitised loans, especially for small and medium sized companies, remains on the agenda, but may require legal and regulatory changes and third party guarantees in order to work, Draghi said. The ECB could launch another long-term refinancing operation (LTRO), similar to the three-year loans they handed out in late 2011 and early 2012 to ease banks’ funding strains, but banks are increasingly paying back such loans early. Which leaves the most powerful tool to fight deflation, quantitative easing, by which the central bank would buy securities from banks that have then more money to lend. But while other major central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have long been relying on this stimulus, QE would be a highly political tool to agree on in the euro zone with its 18 member countries. Inflation would have to undershoot the ECB’s target for price stability significantly to sway the Governing Council. A further appreciation of the euro might do just that. The euro hit a 2-1/2 year high on Friday at $1.3915. ECB Governing Council member Christian Noyer said on Monday he was “not very happy” with the recent appreciation of the euro’s exchange rate, because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation.

13	"The European Union’s to-do list isn’t long this week, but anyone interested in financial regulation should get ready for some late nights. The bloc is pushing for a final deal on a new bank-resolution framework for the euro zone and more transparency on foreign bank accounts. The crisis in Ukraine will certainly also occupy minds in Brussels.On Monday, euro-zone finance ministers meet for some ordinary business: Cyprus, whose third review a year after its bailout was just completed, is expecting a fresh injection of cash to be approved. The money won’t reach the island till April. There had been hopes that Greece, too, could get the finance ministers’ backing for a fresh disbursement of aid, but the required work in Athens hasn’t been concluded. Experts from the troika of institutions overseeing the Greek bailout — the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank — will report to ministers and then return to the Greek capital to wrap up their review.

Attention is focused on China’s trade deficit and growth possibly falling far short of target, but another bit of data over the weekend should not be neglected—China's inflation rate dropped to 2% y/y in Feb, from 2.5% in Jan and 2.6% in 2013, the same as 2012. As everyone notes repeatedly, you can’t trust Chinese data, but if we were to trust the latest inflation data, we should start worrying about deflation instead of inflation. The PBOC target is 3.5%, by the way. Suppliers to China—like Australia—are not failing to notice. A global slowdown inspired by a Chinese slowdown is back on the fear-list, along with the inevitable suggestion that the motive for devaluation is the classic one, to promote exports, in the guise of corralling speculators. The other big issue is the collection of worries about Europe’s institutional infrastructure. We pretty much stopped worrying about it when the peripheral sovereign debt crisis abated, but the inability to work together to put a bank failure mechanism in place is a pretty big failure. The bank examinations, to be followed by stress tests, have to be credible, too. Meanwhile, the Europeans can’t get their act together on sanctions against Russia, either. We believe Merkel when she says sanctions are a real possibility, but the French are not willing to give up their sale of warships, and evading sanctions is a time-honored business practice in many countries. Europe has long preferred to spend public money on social programs rather than defense, and why not, since the US has been willing to take that expense. But at some point the absence of a coherent European foreign policy is damaging to reputations. As we have noted many times before, a reserve currency is classically the currency of the top military power of the day. The eurozone is trying to redefine a reserve currency as coming from the bloc that has the gold standard of fiscal excellence. It’s an interesting concept and one that is working so far, but it’s not inconceivable that Russia/Ukraine may derail it. Finally, at least we have a complaint about the too-strong euro from a top figure, ECB executive Noyer. He said ""It is clear that when the euro starts to strengthen it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and additional downward pressure on inflation. Both cases aren't warranted at the moment. We are clearly not very happy at the moment."" Noyer says everything is on track and there is no need for the ECB to take any of the many possible actions if “prospects deteriorate or its economy is hit by a slowdown elsewhere in the world.” Meanwhile, Noyer claims a plan is on track for French banks to securitize bundles of small business loans, possibly as early as end-March or April and forming a model for the rest of Europe. Gee, what could go wrong? Well, it’s one way to get non-performings off bank balance sheets. Nobody knows or is willing to disclose how bad the bank situation is in Europe. Draghi is probably sweating over this Achilles heel. The calendar is light this week until Thursday, when we get the usual weekly jobless claims and retail sales. Until then, everyone will watch Russia/Ukraine, China and the European Parliament, all imprenetrable institutions with untrustworthy news bites. This is the ideal environment for a little dollar strength, or at least a decent Tuesday pullback. (Note that the USD/CAD bounced off support in a textbook-perfect response to an oversold condition.

  unrest in Venezuela that has left at least 20 dead and convulsed
  the South American OPEC nation, diplomatic sources said on

  Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
Chinese exports tumble. Chinese exports
  fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6%
  gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in
  February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit
  since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year
  holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data.
  ""Despite our belief that the
  actual trade situation is better than official
  data suggests, the
  disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese
  yuan(CNY) and the GDP
  growth outlook for Q1 2014,"" say economists at Standard
  Chartered.Chinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer
  price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing
  from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing
  market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's
  producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier,
  marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year
  drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.

Copper falls. 
Copper futures slid
  more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China.
  However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading
  near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.

Quiet markets. Futures point to a
  quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P
  500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from
  Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and
  the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of
  Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the
  Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell
  2.9%.
Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data
  suggest 
  Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in
  the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate.
  Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from
  5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main
  drags on the headline number.
Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a
  record current account deficit in January of ¥1.589 trillion. The
  deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade
  deficit, which widened to ¥2.345 trillion fom ¥1.047 trillion.
  ""Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next
  April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration
  of the balance of payments,"" says Osamu Takashima, a Citi
  strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of
  the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.
Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month
  high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence
  conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest
  confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to
  13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market
  economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take — the
  consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this
  month.
Cross-border lending contracts. The latest data
  from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing
  decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of
  2013. ""International banking activity was characterised by lower
  credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013,
  mirroring developments in the previous quarter,"" said the BIS in
  its Quarterly Review
  published Sunday. ""Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466
  billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this
  contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late
  2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most
  pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or
  4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres
  ($35 billion or 1.7%).""
Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian
  military forces 
  tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the
  weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international
  watchdogs who tried to enter the region. ""Ukraine remains very much a potential
  dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for
  safe haven flow,"" write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a
  note to clients this morning. ""For now, though, the market looks to still
  be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle
  as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports
  informing the market rather than any possible concern over
  possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports
  across Ukraine).""

ECB not happy with euro
  strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of
  France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is
  not happy with the euro's recent strength. ""It’s a
  very important input in the economic development and inflation
  development,"" Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with
  Manus Cranny in Paris. ""When the euro tends to strengthen, it
  creates additional downward pressure on the economy and
  inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not
  happy at the moment."" The Governing Council declined to announce
  any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting
  last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's
  comments.

21	"TermLONDON - Banks in the eurozone are now more exposed to government debt than at any time since the financial crisis began, with many increasingly using their balance sheets to prop up ailing governments, deepening the bank-sovereign link that has already pushed a number of countries and lenders into bailouts.Banks in the region now hold about 1.75 trillion euros in government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to European Central Bank data. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the entire banking system is now on loan to governments.Although the ECB has said it is keen to break what it terms the sovereign-bank nexus, analysts warn that its hands are tied. European governments need - and many encourage - their banks to finance growing public debt piles because many simply do not have enough alternative buyers after an exodus of foreign investors.""The sovereign-bank nexus is growing and it is a concern,"" said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JP Morgan. ""The ECB and regulators want to reduce this risk, but they know they can't right now because the region is only just emerging from a debt crisis. If debt sustainability issues resurface in the future, it will be a problem for heavily exposed banks.""Since the 1980s, global banking regulations have enshrined incentives to hold government debt by making it zero risk-weighted. The Basel Committee chose not to change these zero weightings when the rules were last updated in 2010. Fitch said the latest rulebook even ""turbocharges"" previous risk weightings.""The reason that government bonds are zero risk-weighted by regulators is partly political; it is not how we weight them in our credit analysis,"" said Bridget Gandy, a bank analyst at Fitch, who added that underdeveloped capital markets often necessitate the bank-sovereign nexus.""Somebody has to buy government bonds, and many countries have traditionally leant on their banking systems to do exactly that. Only once a country's capital markets develop, with a healthy insurance and pension sector, do you increase the pool of buyers, and some countries aren't there yet.""The ECB is blamed by many for having facilitated an increase in exposures, providing banks with cheap loans initially at just 1 percent - falling recently to 0.25 percent - which they can pump into government securities that over the past few years have yielded 7 percent and more - in effect an easy profit.Cash-strapped peripheral banks - many of which have been shut out of primary markets - have welcomed the opportunity to plug capital shortfalls, ploughing over half of their net borrowings from the ECB's emergency longer-term refinancing operations facility into bonds, while lending a mere 13% to the real economy, according to JP Morgan figures.The carry trade is estimated to be worth between 5 billion euros and 20 billion euros a year to Spanish and Italian banks, with many firms using the trade not only to hide deep losses, but also as a way to build up capital buffers - in effect using ECB funds to save private shareholders from being diluted.Banks' holdings of government bonds have risen by 355 billion euros - or about 25 percent - since the liquidity injections in late 2011 and early 2012. Banks in fiscally weak countries have increased their purchases the most, with Italian, Portuguese and Spanish banks increasing their holdings by 62 percent, 52 percent and 45 percent respectively.""Policymakers say that they need to break this negative feedback loop, but as a side effect, ECB policies have enabled banks to load up on government debt which has furthered the link between banks and their home sovereign,"" said Stefan Best, a bank analyst at Standard & Poor's.""The LTRO allowed banks to borrow huge amounts of cash from the central bank at low interest rates and several have used that money to buy government debt to bolster revenues,"" said Best. ""Governments have not objected to them doing this.""It is not the first time that banks have piled into a sovereign-debt-linked carry trade in search of easy money. In the previous decade, many banks, including BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank bought billions in Greek debt in order to cash in on the extra yield offered.That trade spectacularly backfired when Athens was forced to restructure its private debts, leaving those four banks with multi-billion euro losses and the Greek and Cypriot banking systems in need of mass recapitalizations after organizations bailing out the country decided to impose a haircut on Greek debt.Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of last year was 133 percent, higher than the 129 percent that Greece had in the last full year before it asked for a bailout. Spain also has a debt higher than its annual GDP. According to the IMF, there have been 600 cases of sovereign debt restructuring since the 1950s in 95 countries, often with debt levels lower than Spain and Italy.Although banks' exposure to government debt is now lower than in the 1990s, when banks in countries including Belgium and Greece devoted more than 20 percent of their balance sheets to sovereign debt, public debt levels across Europe are much higher today, increasing the risk of a debt restructuring.In Spain and Italy, exposures have increased rapidly in recent years. Spanish banks now hold 297 billion euros of government debt, equivalent to 9.4 percent of total industry assets and up from less than 3 percent in late 2008. Italian banks hold 407 billion euros, roughly 10 percent of total assets and up from 4.6 percent in late 2008.That growing exposure would increase the risk and cost of mass bank recapitalization in the event of a government debt restructuring.""The ECB is keen to reduce this dangerous link but it can't escape the fact that many governments still need banks to buy their debt,"" said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist at RBS. ""The purpose of banks isn't to finance their national governments, but they are being encouraged to do precisely that.""

23	The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone’s economy.EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.Founded in 2013, Binary Tribune aims at providing its readers accurate and actual financial news coverage.

24	Reuters Staff2 Min ReadBy Laura Noonan DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations in an announcement on Tuesday on how it will test the balance sheets of the euro zone’s largest banks, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters. The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors deciding whether they need billions of euros of extra capital. The tests are being done to restore investor confidence and clean up any lingering problems in the euro zone’s banks before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November. The methods some euro zone banks use to decide if a loan has turned sour will fall short of those in the ECB’s review of banks’ loan books, a source with knowledge of the matter said. The rules will require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said, and will also set the banks estimates of loan losses against ‘challenger models’ created by external auditors. The ECB declined to comment.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2018 Reuters. All Rights Reserved.	Business
25	Reuters Staff4 Min Read* Impairments and ‘hard to value’ assets key areas * Loans pitted against auditors’ ‘challenger models’ * Collateral not valued for over a year must be revalued By Laura Noonan DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations to the euro zone’s largest banks when it details on Tuesday how it will test balance sheets, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters. The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors looking at whether they need billions of euros of extra capital to strengthen balance sheets. Estimates of the capital shortfall range from 280 billion euros ($388.13 billion)to as much as 770 billion. The tests are being carried out to restore investor confidence in the banks and clean up any problems left over from the financial crisis before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November. As well as the initial review on whether banks’ assets are correctly valued now, banks will also be subjected to a stress test looking at whether they need more capital to deal with future crises. A document detailing the tests’ methodology has been in circulation amongst national supervisors and consultants for several weeks. Recipients have signed non-disclosure agreements and face penalties for any breaches. “It will terrify them, even though they’ve got a reasonable idea of what’s coming,” one source with knowledge of the guidelines told Reuters, pointing to the very prescriptive approach laid out over nearly 300 pages. The ECB declined to comment. The three sources said the most closely-watched areas in Tuesday’s announcement would be the ECB’s view of when loans become impaired, and the way ‘hard to value assets’ are treated. For loan losses, the guidelines include a simple rule that any loan more than 90 days overdue is non-performing and a more complex one that sets out the other triggers that suggest full repayment is unlikely, two of the sources said. A third source said that while the ECB’s decision on impairment triggers was “reasonable” some banks would still fall short of it since not all banks would use all the triggers on the ECB’s list of definitions of indicators for impairment. Triggers can include things like evidence that a corporate borrower is in distress and evidence that the value of the collateral underpinning a loan has fallen. “Triggers can be subjective,” the second source said. If a loan’s status is changed from performing to non-performing, it would have a higher probability of default, some thing that would force a bank to set aside more capital to provide for higher likely losses. Banks’ estimates on loan losses will be pitted against ‘challenger models’ created by external auditors - carrying out the tests on behalf of supervisors - an approach first tried in Ireland’s balance sheet assessment in late 2013, two of the sources said. Previous rounds of bank tests have tested the models in use by the banks rather than creating brand new ones. The rules also require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said. Beyond loans, the ECB’s treatment of ‘Level 3 assets’, a broad group of assets that are difficult to value, will also be closely watched. Those Level 3 assets include derivatives and also include assets such as real estate holdings banks have acquired through foreclosures, their participations in private equity deals and special investment vehicles. The ECB has taken care to prevent any leaks. Recipients of details of the review face fines of 100,000 euros for leaks and copies have been water-marked with the name of its owner, the sources said.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

27	"Notifications on the latest stories and events, as they happen.Just hit 'Allow' on the next promptThe European Central Bank's stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations to the euro zone's largest banks when it details tomorrow how it will test balance sheets.This is according to three sources with knowledge of the tests, Reuters have reported. The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors looking at whether they need billions of euros of extra capital to strengthen balance sheets. Estimates of the capital shortfall range from €280 billion to as much as €770 billion.The tests are being carried out to restore investor confidence in the banks and clean up any problems left over from the financial crisis before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.As well as the initial review on whether banks' assets are correctly valued now, banks will also be subjected to a stress test looking at whether they need more capital to deal with future crises.A document detailing the tests' methodology has been in circulation amongst national supervisors and consultants for several weeks. Recipients have signed non-disclosure agreements and face penalties for any breaches.""It will terrify them, even though they've got a reasonable idea of what's coming,"" one source with knowledge of the guidelines told Reuters, pointing to the very prescriptive approach laid out over nearly 300 pages.The ECB declined to comment.The three sources said the most closely-watched areas in the announcement would be the ECB's view of when loans become impaired, and the way 'hard to value assets' are treated.For loan losses, the guidelines include a simple rule that any loan more than 90 days overdue is non-performing and a more complex one that sets out the other triggers that suggest full repayment is unlikely, two of the sources said.A third source said that while the ECB's decision on impairment triggers was ""reasonable"" some banks would still fall short of it since not all banks would use all the triggers on the ECB's list of definitions of indicators for impairment.Triggers can include things like evidence that a corporate borrower is in distress and evidence that the value of the collateral underpinning a loan has fallen.

An anti-government protester sets up a barricade next to a burning kiosk during a protest at Altamira square in Caracas March 9, 2014. Latin American foreign ministers will meet next week to discuss the unrest in Venezuela that has left at least 20 dead and convulsed the South American OPEC nation, diplomatic sources said on Friday.




Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
Chinese exports tumble.
    Chinese exports fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6% gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data. ""
    Despite our belief that the actual trade situation is better than official data
suggests, the disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese yuan
(CNY) and the GDP growth outlook for Q1 2014,"" say economists at Standard Chartered.

Copper falls.
Copper futures slid more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China. However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.


Quiet markets.
      Futures point to a quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P 500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 2.9%.
    

Japan GDP growth revised down.
    Revised GDP data suggest
    Japan's economy expanded only 0.7%
    at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate. Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from 5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main drags on the headline number.
  
Record Japanese deficits.
    Japan also announced a record current account deficit in January of ¥1.589 trillion. The deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade deficit, which widened to ¥2.345 trillion fom ¥1.047 trillion. ""
    Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration of the balance of payments,"" says Osamu Takashima, a Citi strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month high.
    A survey of euro zone investor confidence conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to 13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take - the consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this month.
  
Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine.
    Pro-Russian military forces
    tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region
    over the weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international watchdogs who tried to enter the region.
    ""Ukraine remains very much a potential dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for safe haven flow,"" write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a note to clients this morning. ""
For now, though, the market looks to still be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports informing the market rather than any possible concern over possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports across Ukraine).""


ECB not happy with euro strength.
      ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is not happy with the euro's recent strength.
      ""It's a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,"" Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. ""When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn't warranted. So we're not happy at the moment."" The Governing Council declined to announce any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's comments.

Below is a Business Insider Q&A with Aurelija Augulyte, a macro strategist at Nordea Markets.



***


BUSINESS INSIDER: To what extent do you think poor weather has impacted this winter's economic data?

BI: What's the big story that nobody is talking about right now?

AA:
Few are talking about the true risks of
domestic
debt crisis potential in Asia. Asian EM FX is still perceived as a ""safe haven"" on wrong comparisons with previous classical EM crises. This time is different. Asian EM FX are most overvalued. If they are forced to defend their currencies at some point, this will result in unwelcome tightening of monetary conditions (essentially the reverse of what has been happening until recently, resulting in rapid domestic credit expansion).

BI: Are you optimistic about Janet Yellen as Fed chair?

AA:
    Yes, she is consistent, and the ""Yellen put"" should be at work to ensure that any correction in stock markets won't be too deep (up to 15%).
  
BI: The stock market is roaring back to all-time highs. Do issues in EM not have as big an impact on U.S. markets as people argued a few weeks ago?

AA:
    They should. But we haven't seen an EM crisis yet - only localized FX adjustments. No big change in credit spreads yet. Thus no spillover to global credit, liquidity premia and volatility. Still pending!
  
BI: What's something you'll be watching this week and next?



AA:
        If not watching, then listening to the multiple speeches from Fed members. Their take on recent data weakness. Data-wise I think everything will be seen through the ""it's weather, stupid"" filter by markets, still.

29	Reuters Staff1 Min ReadPARIS (Reuters) - Price stability is under threat in major economies due to low inflation, warranting action from central banks, ECB policymaker Christian Noyer said on Monday. Noyer, who is governor of the Bank of France, warned that “permanent and deep forces” were weighing on inflation in the euro zone and wider world. “Monetary policy should remain active because persistently low inflation threatens the achievement of price stability as commonly defined by all major central banks today,” Noyer told a conference at the French central bank. Noyer cited vast slack in many economies as a source of low inflation as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt.

30	Reuters Staff3 Min Read* Noyer sees “permanent and deep forces” weighing on inflation * Euro strength adding to downward inflation pressures   (Adds details on ECB action) PARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - Price stability is under threat in major economies from low inflation, warranting action by central banks, ECB policymaker Christian Noyer said on Monday. Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, warned that “permanent and deep forces” were weighing on inflation in the euro zone and wider world. “Monetary policy should remain active because persistently low inflation threatens the achievement of price stability as commonly defined by all major central banks today,” Noyer told a conference at the French central bank. Noyer cited slack in many economies as a source of low inflation, as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt. “The recent appreciation of the euro has had indeed a strong disinflationary impact,” Noyer added. The euro rose in recent days to 1.39 to the dollar, its highest since late 2011, after the European Central Bank left its monetary policy unchanged on Thursday. The Eurostat EU statistics agency estimated euro zone inflation held steady in February at 0.8 percent, well below the ECB’s target of close to but less than 2.0 percent. Noyer said he did not currently see deflation - what he described as a “pernicious spiral” downward in prices that chokes consumption and investment - in the euro zone and that inflation expectations were firmly anchored in positive territory. The ECB’s inflation target was meant to provide a cushion against negative shocks to the economy that could drive inflation lower, Noyer said. The euro zone was vulnerable without a buffer, he said. Against that background, the ECB’s Governing Council has made it explicit that its members expect to keep interest rates at current or lower levels for an extended period of time. Such forward guidance is a relatively new tool the ECB has called on to influence the economy. Noyer said it was unlikely central banks would go back to relying solely on their conventional tool, short-term interest rates. But even with more levers available to central banks than in the past, Noyer warned that there were limits to what monetary policy could do. “The longer interest rates are kept at low levels, the greater the risk for financial stability,” he said.

31	Reuters Staff1 Min ReadPARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - French European Central Banker Christian Noyer voiced concern on Monday over the appreciation of the euro and said he shared the view of his German counterpart on policy options that could be used by the euro zone’s central bank. “I fully agree with Jens Weidmann that the suspension of sterilisation is one of the tools we may use if needed,” Noyer, head of the Bank of France and a member of the ECB’s governing council alongside Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, told Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of a conference in Paris. Concerning appreciation of the euro’s exchange rate, Noyer said he was “not very happy” because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation.

32	"Published: Mar 10, 2014 6:51 a.m. ETByPARIS--The slow pace of price increases and nominal wages in the euro area risks hampering adjustment strategies within the currency zone, a process necessary for some member countries to become more competitive, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said Monday.""The euro area needs such adjustments in order for some countries, including France, to regain competitiveness,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability.""A country's inflation differential with others has a direct impact on its real exchange rate, a measure of its competitiveness. In order to make the goods and services it produces more competitive, a euro zone country would need to post inflation lower than the bloc's, a difficult challenge if prices are overall close to zero.Euro zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area. The ECB also recently lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 1% from an earlier forecast of 1.1% in December, but said inflation would gradually rise to 1.3% in 2015. By 2016, inflation should reach 1.5%, still shy of the ECB's target of just under 2% over the medium term.Still, Mr. Noyer insisted that the euro zone isn't facing deflation.""Low inflation is not deflation,"" Mr. Noyer told a panel discussion at the Bank of France, noting that expectations remain firmly anchored in positive territory, even in the short run. ""There's no deflation today in the euro area: prices are still increasing, and most importantly, so are nominal wages.""He warned however that the problem needs serious consideration, and that even small signs that a generalized fall in prices and wages is taking place should be carefully watched.""The situation today calls for a very careful assessment in the balance of risks,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""Precisely because deflation is hard to reverse, even small probabilities should not be neglected and they should be fully factored into policymaking.""The reasons for low inflation are multiple, Mr. Noyer said, but pointed to an important unused capacity and to the recent appreciation of the euro as the main ones.Write to Gabriele Parussini at gabriele.parussini@wsj.comJoin the conversationCopyright © 2018 MarketWatch, Inc.

35	"European Union governments and parliamentarians will try to reach a compromise this week on how to wind down failing banks in marathon talks intended to settle who decides to close banks and who picks up the bill. A deal in the negotiations, set to span three days, would be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for all eurozone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one common pot of money to pay for it.  The union, and the thorough clean-up of banks’ books that will accompany it, is meant to restore banks’ confidence in one another and boost lending to other businesses and households.  New lending has been throttled by banks’ efforts to raise capital and reduce the bad loans that proliferated in the recession triggered by the global financial crisis and deepened by the eurozone’s own sovereign debt crisis.  Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank (ECB) will be the single supervisor for all eurozone banks from November.  But talks on a single European agency to wind up or close failing banks, and on a single fund to back it up, have entered a crucial stage: EU governments, represented by finance ministers of the 28-nation bloc, and the European Parliament must reach a deal next week.  If they don’t, there won’t be enough time to complete the legislative process for the resolution mechanism before the last sitting of the current parliament in mid-April. The key law would be delayed by at least seven months, probably more.  “The ground is very well prepared, now we have to show political will. We will stay there (in the meeting) as long as it takes to find a solution,” one EU official involved in the preparations for the talks said.  “It’s clear to all EU member states that if we want to achieve an agreement there’s only one direction to go — to try to accommodate the parliament,” the official said.  The problem is that European governments and the European Parliament want different things.  EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the eurozone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that decision must be signed into law by the EU’s executive Commission and by all the finance ministers.  The European Parliament wants no involvement of EU finance ministers, arguing it would politicise the process.  Parliament also wants the ECB — the supervisor of all banks — to be the only institution that can declare a bank is failing and that its fate has to be resolved. EU governments want the single resolution agency board and national authorities to have a say.  Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the shared resolution fund and how soon all the money in it should be accessible to all countries.  The fund will be filled from contributions of all eurozone banks and is to reach, eventually, around €55bn.

EU governments want the single resolution agency board and national authorities to have a say.  Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the shared resolution fund and how soon all the money in it should be accessible to all countries.  The fund will be filled from contributions of all eurozone banks and is to reach, eventually, around €55bn.

Fundamental Forecast for Euro: Neutral
- Forex seasonality over the past 20 years favor a stronger EURUSD in March.

- A better than expected February Nonfarm Payrolls report stunted a potential major EURUSD breakout.

- Have a bullish (or bearish) bias on the Euro, but don’t know which pair to use? Use a Euro currency basket.

The Euro’s resiliency continued to shine this week as a bout of mixed economic data took a backseat to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday. On a cooling of tensions in Eastern Europe and seemingly diminished outcome of military conflict, the higher yielding currencies led the pack as risk appetite surged: the EURAUD depreciated by -1.08% and the EURNZD eased by -0.38%. The Euro’s strength came through in the last two days of the week, and its gains elsewhere are constructive going forward.

While the ECB’s meeting on Thursday helped the Euro realize its pent up bullish potential, it may have just paved the way for further gains over the coming months. The window in which to ease further may be closing, and as a result, the door to a period of monetary stability may have been opened. 

As ECB President Mario Draghi made clear in the press conference on Thursday, the ECB does not want to simply just inject more liquidity into the Euro-Zone banking system; there is little need right now. Interbank lending rates (EONIA) are stable below the ECB’s overnight reference rate of 0.25%, which means funding stresses are low. Sovereign yields are stable at multi-year lows (bond prices at highs) and equity markets are buoyed; the linkages between the Euro-Zone banking system and her sovereigns are being strained.

With the PMI surveys pointing to continued modest growth and Euro-Zone inflation starting to tick higher, any new non-standard dovish policies could send the wrong signal as the ECB undertakes role as supervisor of the Euro-Zone banking system; economic data has been generally improved recently, even consumption. As the ECB prepares its stress tests (AQR), announcing a liquidity injections before the results come out might signal to the market that the ECB discovered something unknown and materially negative once they began to review banks' balance sheets.

Instead, so as to prevent unnecessary confusion about the health of the banking system, the ECB is stuck in neutral. To be clear: the ECB stands ready to act if necessary, and quite frankly, it seems that the Governing Council would like to do more. But at present time, short-term economic momentum doesn’t dictate that necessity. This is not inaction; this is a deliberate attempt to do nothing and see where the chips fall. Only if data falls back will the ECB act – crisis conditions don’t exist.

Eventually, a BoE-styled Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) seems like the most palatable outcome for the market is crisis conditions remain absent. This could address credit concerns at the consumer and small business level (SMEs), and it wouldn’t put the Euro at risk of a massive ECB balance sheet expansion that another LTRO or a Fed-styled QE would bring (this would please the German influence). For now, data needs to remain sturdy as the door remains open for further Euro gains. – CV

37	" NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Cooperman, chief executive of hedge fund Omega Advisors, said Monday that he agreed with activist investor Carl Icahn's push for eBay Inc to spin off its PayPal online payments business. ""I give Carl a lot of credit for taking the time and showing the energy, and in this case, we happen to agree with him,"" Cooperman, an eBay shareholder, said on CNBC television. ""I think they should spin out a portion of PayPal,"" he said, noting that he owns about 2 percent of eBay shares. Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off PayPal. The billionaire investor has repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance. Cooperman also said that the U.S. stock market was fairly valued at its current levels and would be surprised if it shot higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 29.6 percent last year, notching its best annual performance since 1997. The benchmark index has risen about 1.6 percent so far this year. In a separate interview, Icahn told CNBC that eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe has delivered ""mediocre"" results for the company versus peers such as Amazon, Visa and MasterCard Inc. EBay rejected Icahn's two nominees to its board on Monday, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting. Icahn said Monday that nutrition and weight loss company Herbalife was not a pyramid scheme, a claim that hedge fund manager William Ackman has made. Icahn and Ackman have publicly feuded over the company's value. Icahn owned about 16.8 percent of Herbalife's shares at the end of last year, according to regulatory filings, while Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management has bet $1.16 billion that the company is a fraud. ""It has gone to a point that I think is almost bordering on the insane,"" Icahn said in response to a New York Times article on Monday about Ackman's $1 billion bet that Herbalife will fail, entitled ""After Big Bet, Hedge Fund Pulls the Levers of Power."" Icahn, chairman of Icahn Enterprises L.P., said he had ""never sold a share"" of Herbalife. (Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"	Business
38	Follow @csaid Billionaire investor Carl Icahn (center) talks with Robert Greifeld (right), Nasdaq OMX Group CEO, in New York in 2012. (Bloomberg)EBay has come out swinging against activist investor Carl Icahn.The San Jose e-tailer on Monday officially rejected Icahn’s proposed two board nominees. Icahn, who holds a 2.2 percent stake in eBay, wants the company to spin off PayPal, its electronic payments division. He wanted two of his employees on the eBay board to promote that agenda.“Neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise,” said Richard Schlosberg, chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee.Instead, eBay backs the re-election of four existing board members: President and CEO John Donahoe; Fred Anderson, co-founder and managing director of Elevation Partners; Edward Barnholt, former CEO of Agilent Technologies; and Scott Cook, co-founder and chairman of Intuit.Talking smack, the company and the pugnacious billionaire issued dueling press releases notable for their frankness.In a lengthy screed on his website, ShareholdersSquareTable, Icahn accused eBay CEO John Donohoe of “inexcusable incompetence (that) cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion” for selling Skype too soon and too cheaply. He also attacked eBay board member Marc Andreessen, whose investor group bought Skype and then flipped it to Microsoft at a $4 billion premium. Previously, he’d also taken aim at Intuit’s Cook,Under eBay’s tender ministrations, PayPal may “wither,” Icahn wrote. “ I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL ,” he wrote.For its part, Ebay said Icahn is dabbling in “false and misleading” statements.“New eBay shareholder Carl Icahn has cherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context to attack the integrity of two of the most respected, accomplished and value-driven technology leaders in Silicon Valley,” it said, referring to Andreessen and Cook. “And eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe is widely respected for his turnaround of eBay and leadership of the company over the past six years.” Icahn’s 2.2 percent eBay stake isn’t actually enough for him to actually wrest much control. So what’s his real agenda?As Icahn biographer Mark Stevens last week told Chronicle business editor and columnist Tom Lee: ”It’s all a game to him. He’s a master chess player. The only person who knows what Carl Icahn really wants is Carl Icahn.”	Business

				    EBay just might be able to have it both ways. The online merchant thinks owning PayPal is symbiotic. But activist investor Carl Icahn says the online auction and payments businesses would be worth more separated. Storage hardware giant EMC garnered some of the best of both worlds by partially spinning off virtualisation software group VMware. The same approach at eBay could defuse the tension.

PayPal gets about a third of its new customers from eBay, the company says. That figure is still substantial, though falling. EBay also argues that merchant data help mitigate losses from payment ...This article is no longer available in our repository.There could be multiple reasons for this.PREVIOUS STORYNEXT STORYCopyrights © 2018 Business Standard Private Ltd.

40	"Carl Icahn has been going activist on eBay  since Jan. 22, when he disclosed a position in the company and began lobbying for PayPal to be spun off as a separate entity. Icahn has had a very successful career of forcing companies to temporarily shift capital to ventures that build short-term shareholder wealth, greatly enriching himself in the process. Personally, I am not a fan of forcing a management team to use cash for buybacks rather than investing in the business or spinning off divisions just to get a quick payback at the expense of long-term stable growth.However, Icahn has brought up several good points about conflicts of interest, and pointed out that the potential for competition with Apple  could weigh on the larger company's valuation if management doesn't act quickly. The increasing focus on eBay is actually revealing the potential future value of PayPal. If the company is spun off, it could do for eBay what Alibaba is doing for Yahoo! .Payments dragging down profit growth In 2013, payments accounted for 41% of revenue, but with a lower gross margin than core marketplace  business and continues to act as a drag on profitability. As Gross Market Value increased by 10.6%, net income only increased by 9.5%, in part due to higher-margin core business growing more slowly than lower-margin payments business. Competition may increase dramatically Apple has made it clear that entering the payments business is on its radar. Take this quote from the recent conference call:The mobile payments area in general is one that we've been intrigued with, and that was one of the thoughts behind Touch ID. But, we're not limiting ourselves just to that. So, I don't have anything specific to announce today, but you can tell by looking at the demographics of our customers and the amount of commerce that goes through iOS devices versus the competition that it's a big opportunity on the platform.Apple has 600 million iTunes accounts, each one with a credit card tied to it. Considering the potential impact of that on PayPal's business outside of eBay, it should concern shareholders who want a specialized management team to fend off that threat.The other issue outstanding is board effectiveness  Marc Andreessen did personally profit by being a part of the venture group that purchased a majority interest in Skype from eBay. The group sold the investment to Microsoft only 18 months later for more than three times the price. It's questionable about how much value the VCs could have brought to the table in such a short period of time to warrant an increase in value from $2.75 billion to $8 billion in less than two years. Other conflicts of interest were also brought up in Icahn's letter to eBay shareholders, but this was the most glaring. I'm not suggesting that this was a deliberate attempt to profit from eBay's ignorance, but independent directors are paid to share their industry insights from working in other facets of the field. And in this case, there doesn't seem to be enough guidance from the board.eBay's AlibabaIn 2005, Yahoo! invested $1 billion for a 40% stake in Alibaba. This could end up being the investment of the decade when Alibaba goes public later this year and this stake is monetized for many times what was originally paid. According to the Wall Street Journal, some analysts are expecting a valuation of as much as $100 billion for the IPO. Oddly, something similar could happen with eBay. If eBay were to spin out a majority interest in PayPal, the company may be able to operate more effectively from a margin standpoint and expand its relationships with retailers like Target who are looking for a safer payment platform.PayPal's revenue grew 19% in 2013 to $6.6 billion, according to the recently filed 10K. If eBay were to spin off PayPal with a net margin of 20%, and if the market awarded a multiple of 30, the company could be worth over $45 billion as a stand-alone entity. Since eBay's marketcap is only $76 billion, the spin off seems to make sense.  PayPal was acquired in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Unlike the Silverlake venture, eBay grew the business over the next decade and appears to have the potential to spin it off for approximately $50 billion.

43	"The new Carl Icahn letter is out.More to come...Here's the letter:
""WE BELIEVE BASED ON EVIDENCE WE HAVE NEWLY UNCOVERED THAT DONAHOE'S INEXCUSABLE INCOMPETENCE

COST EBAY STOCKHOLDERS OVER $4 BILLION. READ OUR LATEST LETTER
AND YOU BE THE JUDGE.""
New York, New York, March 10, 2014 - Today Carl C. Icahn released the following open letter to stockholders of eBay Inc.:
    We believe, based on our review of the evidence currently available in the public domain, including eBay's own statements, that the following assertions are
    
indisputable

    . Stockholders: you be the judge.
  ? eBay CEO John Donahoe oversaw a premature sale of Skype at a diminished price that resulted in eBay stockholders losing over $4 billion as compared to the sale of Skype to Microsoft 18 months later.? Who can doubt that if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired when the facts were disclosed to the owners? But sadly at many of our public companies, such as eBay, there is a lack of accountability, and transgressions by management are swept under the rug by crony boards. If middle management makes a costly error, they pay the price; if the CEO makes one, too often the ""old boy"" board covers it up and gives him a bonus.
    ? In litigation documents
    [3]
that we have just uncovered
    , Skype's founders alleged that John Donahoe and eBay director Marc Andreessen's investor group received information from Mike Volpi, an associate of Skype's founders, that there could be a workaround of the technology that was the subject of the licensing dispute between eBay and Skype's founders and that was reportedly the cause of Microsoft ""walking away.""
  
    ? With the apparent benefit of this information, Andreessen's investor group purchased a controlling interest in Skype from eBay for $1.9 billion.
    The Andreessen investor group then quickly settled the licensing litigation with Skype's founders, and flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion - tripling their money in only 18 months.
The obvious unanswered question is: why didn't Donahoe, who allegedly also had the information that would be key to reaching a settlement with Skype's founders, settle it for eBay and sell Skype directly to Microsoft, thereby keeping the extra $4 billion for eBay stockholders?

    ? To make matters even more embarrassing for Donahoe, Marc Andreessen boasted upon the announcement of the sale to Microsoft that his group's risks in buying Skype had always been less than they had appeared. He said that he ""
    knew that for Microsoft and a number of other companies Skype would be an obvious thing to buy
    "" and that he ""[would]
    always have the fall-back of selling to strategic buyers
    .""
    [4]
    Obviously, the same logic should also have applied to Donahoe.
    Therefore, why did he sell Skype to the Andreessen investor group instead of keeping the $4 billion for stockholders (it would have been interesting to see Donahoe's face when Andreessen actually boasted about his windfall)?
    The board and Donahoe, in typical PR speech, have swept this $4 billion fiasco under the rug and have actually boasted about their success in executing this transaction between eBay and the Andreessen investor group. However, Joe Nocera of the New York Times does not appear to have been fooled by eBay's PR machine. At the time of the sale to Andreessen's group, he wrote: ""And so, the mystery of the Skype deal: why were the winning bidders willing to pay so high a price for a company whose very existence could be threatened by this lawsuit? One possibility is that they have nerves of steel. The other is that
    they know something nobody else does
    .""
    
      
        [5]
      
    
? Amazingly, Donahoe chose to sell a controlling interest in Skype to Andreessen's investor group, allowing them to reap billions at the expense of eBay and its stockholders, rather than cleaning up the licensing issues and then pursuing a more lucrative exit, such as an IPO or a sale to a strategic buyer.
    ? Any first year student in finance would understand that if you want to sell a company and you have a party that wishes to buy but is concerned about technology licensing issues, you fix the issues and then you sell. It's even more absurd not to do so when you know there is a potential solution.
    
I believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion.

? I have been so successful with companies over the years because I have brought in the right CEO. Sometimes convincing boards to make changes takes years, but when change ultimately comes the results are often startlingly good. In just the last year, simply examine our successes at Forest Laboratories and Chesapeake Energy etc. We believe that at the very least, eBay stockholders must send Donahoe and the board a message that we are very unhappy with the current situation at eBay. In addition to the egregious issues surrounding the Skype situation, it should also be noted that in just the past year eBay has underperformed its peers. Indeed, from January 1, 2013 through our initial involvement on January 10, 2014, Amazon, Visa and MasterCard returned 60%, 48% and 73%, respectively, while eBay stock returned only 2%.? In our opinion, eBay and PayPal should immediately be separated. It is my firm belief that if this occurred, there would be a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal. However, on the other hand, I fear that if left under the management of eBay it will ""wither"" (as Elon Musk said). I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL - the same way that Motorola Mobility may have gone had we not been able to convince Motorola's board to bring in a new CEO and separate the companies - ultimately resulting in a sale to Google.
CONCLUSION

    The true owners of eBay cannot and should not tolerate any longer the behavior exhibited by CEO John Donahoe and the board as detailed above. We believe that eBay is the quintessential example of what is wrong with corporate governance at many of our public corporations and why the system is dysfunctional. If we, as stockholders, do not send a clear message to the eBay board that we will no longer tolerate the internecine relationships that have come to be accepted as commonplace at eBay, and perhaps more importantly,
    if we continue to follow the advice of Donahoe, even in light of the transgressions regarding Skype as well as the other failures outlined above, and allow him to continue to lead both eBay and PayPal, and if PayPal fails (as Elon Musk and others far more knowledgeable than me have warned), then investors that own shares in the institutions and funds that control the voting of eBay stock will have every right to cast the blame on everyone who failed to vote for change at eBay.
THE TIME HAS COME TO SEND THE EBAY BOARD A MESSAGE THAT THERE WILL NO LONGER BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AT EBAY! VOTE FOR OUR PRECATORY PROPOSAL AND FOR OUR DIRECTOR NOMINEES.Sincerely,"	Business

                Carl Icahn sunk his teeth deeper into eBay (EBAY) Monday, claiming to have evidence showing CEO John Donahoe’s “incompetence” cost shareholders $4 billion.Continue Reading BelowThis comes as the eBay board rejected Icahn’s two board nominees, employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, saying both were unqualified and urging shareholders to vote against them at its upcoming annual meeting.eBay founder and chairman, Pierre Omidyar, urged company stockholders to support the company’s nominees, a list that includes Donahoe.Icahn, the billionaire investor who upped his stake recently in eBay, says he has uncovered “indisputable” evidence related to Donahoe’s handling of eBay’s 2009 Skype deal, which has been of much debate between the two parties in this escalating spat.The online marketplace sold the Internet telephone and video service to an investor group that included director Marc Andreessen’s venture capital firm in a move that valued it at $2.75 billion. Just years later, Skype was sold to Microsoft (MSFT) for $8.5 billion.“We believe based on evidence we have newly uncovered that Donahoe’s inexcusable incompetence cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion,” Icahn said.Continue Reading BelowADVERTISEMENTHe says Donahoe oversaw a “premature” sale of Skype at a diminished price by selling a controlling interest to Andreessen rather than resolving outstanding litigation between eBay and Skype’s founders, which apparently caused Microsoft to initially walk away from the deal in 2009.Andreessen, Icahn claims, then resolved the outstanding licensing litigation and flipped Skype to Microsoft for nearly triple the price -- a roughly $4 billion spread Icahn claims should have been paid to eBay’s shareholders.“The obvious unanswered question is: why didn’t Donahoe, who allegedly also had the information that would be key to reaching a settlement with Skype’s founders, settle it for eBay and sell Skype directly to Microsoft, thereby keeping the extra $4 billion for eBay stockholders?” Icahn said.The investor once again urged eBay shareholders to reconsider Donahoe as CEO, or “at the very least” send a message that they are “very unhappy” with the current situation at eBay. He also continued to call for an immediate PayPal spinoff, saying he believes there would be a “number of bidders” willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal.In response to Icahn’s criticisms, Donahoe said eBay got the “highest value at the time” for Skype and that Andreessen recused himself throughout the Skype process despite Icahn’s criticisms that there were conflicts of interest that led to a mishandling of the deal.On Friday, Andreessen issued a public letter calling out Icahn for his own conflicts of interests related to his unrelated investment in XO and purchase of the telecom giant’s wired business.“Carl Icahn 2014 would take a dim view of the business ethics of Carl Icahn 2005,” Andreessen wrote in the letter.Shares of eBay fell more than 1.5% to $58.14 in recent trade.

45	3 Min Read(Reuters) - EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn’s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting. Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance. The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards. The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.” EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.” EBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes Chief Executive John Donahoe. The company also said Donahoe’s 2013 compensation fell by more than half to $13.8 million. That largely reflects the board’s decision in 2012 to give him a one-time award of $14.8 million in performance share units, although eBay’s weaker-than-expected financial performance also hurt his pay. The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring. Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal. The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company. In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay. “PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said. EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.” “In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said. EBay shares fell 1.4 percent to $58.22 on the Nasdaq. Additional reporting by Deepa Seetharaman in San Francisco; Editing by Richard ChangAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

46	"Carl Icahn's assault on 
 
Ebay
 began with the idea that the company's payments business PayPal would be more valuable as a standalone company. It quickly devolved into a war of words with board member Marc Andreessen and Monday morning it took another turn as the billionaire investor put Ebay CEO John Donahoe squarely in his crosshairs.Criticizing the same Skype transaction he has taken Andreessen to task over, Icahn says Donahoe's ""inexcusable incompetence"" cost EBay shareholders more than $4 billion.(A quick refresher: EBay sold a stake in Skype to an investor group led by Silver Lake that also included Andreessen's venture capital firm. Less than two years later, following the resolution of some intellectual property concerns, 
 
Microsoft
 bought Skype for $8.5 billion.)Icahn's latest barrage reiterates his charge that shareholders got fleeced in a deal that helped line the pockets of a board member for stepping in as middleman. From Monday's letter:

At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion.via Icahn Letter.The letter, which came after Ebay rejected Icahn's proposed board slate Monday, also calls out Donahoe for trailing industry peers. From the start of January until January 10, 2014 -- when Icahn disclosed his investment -- Ebay shares have returned 2% to considerably better returns from

 (+60%),

""Yet in pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John. Just like his previous ones, this attack is false and misleading and has already been utterly discredited by the facts.""Icahn, nodding to the original thrust of his case for buying into Ebay, touched on PayPal in Monday's letter, arguing that an independent payments company could be acquired at a rich premium instead of withering within its current corporate structure (a view that has been shared by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, he notes).""I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, 
 
Dell
, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, 
 
Nintendo
, 
 
Xerox
, 
 
Sony
, Palm, and 
 
AOL
 – the same way that 
 
Motorola Mobility
 may have gone had we not been able to convince Motorola’s board to bring in a new CEO and separate the companies – ultimately resulting in a sale to 
 
Google
,"" says Icahn.PayPal is facing a battle against some of the biggest companies in the world, Icahn argues, among them Google, 
 
Apple
 and Visa, and the billionaire doesn't think Donahoe is the right guy to lead that charge.""To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty,"" he writes.  ""Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal.  PayPal must be separated NOW so that great management can be attracted – management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time.""In an acknowledgement that to date his case for a PayPal spinoff has largely been the rote argument made in most cases for corporate breakups, Icahn promised to share a case study on why such a move makes sense.Two things remain clear: Icahn won't get his way without a fight and Ebay's management and board are going to give him one.Shares of Ebay were down 1.6% to $58.08 Monday morning.Follow @SchaeferStreet"	Business

Ichan has nominated Jonathan Christodoro and Daniel Ninivaggi, to eBay’s board, as part of his efforts to get eBay to spin off its PayPal e-payments business as a separate company.EBay also urged shareholders to vote for the current directors that are up for re-election: Fred Anderson, Edward Barnholt, Scott Cook and company Chief Executive John Donahoe.And it was Donahoe, in particular, who was in Icahn’s sights on Monday.In the latest of his colorful open letters to eBay shareholders, Icahn claimed that the “inexcusable incompetence” of Donahoe has cost eBay’s stock owners more than $4 billion, and based his views on Donahoe’s overseeing of the company’s sale of Skype to a private-equity consortium in 2009.“Who can doubt that if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired when the facts were disclosed to the owners?” Icahn said. “But sadly at many of our public companies, such as eBay, there is a lack of accountability, and transgressions by management are swept under the rug by crony boards.” EBay shares fell 1.4%, to close Monday at $58.22.While eBay was in the red, Facebook Inc.

	The war of words between eBay and its new shareholder Carl Icahn continues to rage on. Today, eBay issued a notice of an upcoming annual meeting, in which the company asked shareholders flat out to vote against Icahn’s proposal to spin off PayPal. Meanwhile, Icahn issued yet another open letter against current eBay management, in which he accused CEO John Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” that cost stockholders $4 billion.Carl Icahn has also proposed adding two employees from the Icahn Group to eBay’s board. (Icahn currently owns 2.15% of eBay as of February 18.) eBay has also asked shareholders to reject that proposal.On the subject of new board members, eBay notes: “The Board of Directors does not endorse any Icahn Group nominee or the Icahn Proposal and unanimously recommends that you vote on the WHITE proxy card or voting instruction form ‘FOR ALL’ of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors and ‘AGAINST’ the Icahn Proposal,” Michael R. Jacobson, company secretary, writes in the SEC filing. “The Board of Directors strongly urges you not to sign or return any proxy card sent to you by the Icahn Group.”And on the subject of the spinoff proposal, it is equally unequivocal: “The Board has carefully considered this proposal and has unanimously agreed that spinning off the Payments segment (PayPal) into a separately traded public company would not be in the best interests of eBay or its stockholders,” it writes. “The Icahn Proposal is not a new idea to the Board or the Company. The Board, together with management and external advisers, has assessed a spin-off of PayPal several times and continues to believe that each of the Company’s payments and commerce segments are stronger together than apart and see compelling benefits to keeping them together. Therefore the Board recommends that you vote AGAINST the Icahn Proposal.”From the looks of it, the Icahn letter doesn’t reveal materially any more information than previous statements from the activist investor but it’s mainly about making sure that they continue to have a fresh statement to match those of eBay: it centers specifically on the sale of Skype at what Icahn believed was not a fair price. He claims that Donahoe and his advisers should not have spun off the asset to a consortium that included Andreessen Horowitz, and should have instead settled outstanding intellectual property issues itself and sold the asset directly to Microsoft (or another interested party).eBay has issued statements against these accusations already, and so has Marc Andreessen.eBay and key people associated with the company have also explained why the split does not make sense. eBay has highlighted the synergies between the two companies and also how a lot of PayPal’s growth is supported by eBay; while Reid Hoffman argued convincingly about the choice between short-term profit and long-term value creation.PayPal has recently started rolling out a new website, and it accounted for around 40% of eBay’s $16 billion in revenues in 2013.The timeline so far, as outlined by eBay in its filing today:On January 16, 2014, eBay received a notice from the Icahn Group indicating that it intended to nominate two Icahn Group employees to stand for election as directors to the eBay Board of Directors at eBay’s 2014 Annual Meeting. The notice also included a precatory proposal recommending that eBay act expeditiously to engage an investment banking firm to effectuate a spin-off of eBay’s Payments segment into a separately traded company.On January 17, 2014, the Icahn Group notified eBay by letter that it had filed a notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, or HSR Act, to enable the Icahn Group to acquire more than $700 million of eBay’s common stock, including any shares that the Icahn Group may already own. On each of January 17 and January 22, 2014, Carl Icahn and John Donahoe, eBay’s President and Chief Executive Officer, had telephone conversations concerning the Icahn Group’s perspectives on eBay and the upcoming annual meeting. No agreements or understandings resulted from these conversations.On January 22, 2014, in connection with eBay’s earnings release and associated conference call, eBay publicly announced that it had received the notice from the Icahn Group regarding the 2014 Annual Meeting.On February 11, 2014, the Icahn Group delivered to eBay an update to its January 16, 2014 notice that included revised biographical information regarding one of the Icahn Group’s proposed nominees and indicated that the Icahn Group had acquired call options that conferred beneficial ownership of approximately 2.15% of eBay’s outstanding common stock.On February 18, 2014, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the HSR Act waiting period to the Icahn Group. Later that day, the Icahn Group notified eBay by letter that it had exercised its call options resulting in the Icahn Group having beneficial ownership of approximately 2.15% of eBay’s outstanding common stock.On February 22, 2014, Mr. Icahn spoke with Mr. Donahoe by telephone.On February 24, 2014, the Icahn Group issued an “open letter” to eBay stockholders that contained various allegations regarding eBay’s Board and seeking support for the Icahn Proposal. eBay responded later that day with a press release stating that the Board welcomed discussion of the Icahn Proposal and rebutting the allegations contained in the Icahn Group’s letter.On February 26, 2014, the Icahn Group submitted a demand to inspect the Company’s books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “Icahn Demand”) and on February 28, 2014 submitted a demand to inspect certain eBay stocklist materials. eBay subsequently offered by letter to provide the Icahn Group with documents responsive to their Section 220 demands.In early March 2014, Mr. Donahoe and Mr. Icahn spoke by telephone and subsequently had an in-person meeting during which additional representatives of both parties were present.Throughout January, February and March, the Icahn Group and the Company published various solicitation materials.Image: eBayLatest headlines delivered to you daily"	Business

Carl Icahn



      For the last several weeks, a firestorm has been raging between eBay and activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been blasting the company's CEO and its board members, particularly the famed Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen.
    

In his letters, Icahn has also been making two demands: That PayPal spin-off from eBay and that two of his employees join the company's board.

Not only has CEO John Donahoe staunchly insisted that the two company's will not split, but today eBay rejected both of Icahn's board member nominees in its preliminary proxy statement for its annual meeting.

eBay's other board nominees are Elevation co-founder Fred Anderson, former CEO of Agilent Technologies Edward Barnholt, and John Donahoe, eBay's president and CEO.

    In his
    latest letter to the eBay's board this morning
    , Icahn writes that Donahoe has cost shareholders $4 billion because of his incompetence.
  eBay responded by accusing Icahn of a ""false and misleading"" attack:John Donahoe has delivered astounding results for eBay shareholders since he became CEO in 2008. In the five years since John's first analyst day, eBay's stock price has increased more than 460%, significantly outpacing both the Nasdaq and the overall market. John's track record of success at eBay, driving the company's turnaround and growth, is well documented. Yet in pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John. Just like his previous ones, this attack is false and misleading and has already been utterly discredited by the facts.Disclosure: Marc Andreessen is an investor in Business Insider."	Business

In the latest episode of the ongoing feud between eBay (EBAY) and billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, CNBC reports that the online auction giant will reject a slate of board nominees proposed by Icahn, raising the stakes in the activist investor’s public battle over ebay’s corporate governance.Last month, Icahn, who has a 2.15 percent stake in eBay, nominated two of his employees to eBay’s board, which he has accused in recent days of putting its interests ahead of the company. This in reference to the company’s 2009 sale of a majority stake in Skype to an investor group that included Marc Andreessen’s venture capital firm. Icahn has accused Andreessen, who is an eBay board member, of a conflict of interest over the deal. Yet on Monday, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC that “eBay plans to reject Icahn’s directors.”In a new development, Icahn, who has demanded an inspection of eBay’s records on the acquisition of Skype in 2005, said that John Donahoe’s “inexcusable incompetence” had cost stockholders more than $4 billion since he sold the online phone service prematurely.“We believe based on evidence we have newly uncovered that Donahoe’s inexcusable incompetence cost eBAY…over $4 billion…I believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion,” the billionaire wrote in an open letter on Monday.Icahn insists that eBay spin off its fast-growing PayPal payments business – an idea dismissed by the company.“PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Visa (V), etc”, said Icahn, adding that “[t]o win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty. Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal. PayPal must be separated NOW so that great management can be attracted – management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time.”Shares of eBay were down 56 cents, or 0.95%, at $58.50 in pre-market trading Monday.Your email address will not be published.CommentName *Email *Website

62	"Carl Icahn has again posted an open letter on his website, Shareholders’ Square Table, about eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and the ongoing conflicts of interest he sees with the company’s board members. He said he has uncovered new evidence which he says makes his assertion that shareholders lost billions on the Skype deal indisputable.The activist investor blames CEO John Donahoe for overseeing “a premature sale of Skype at a diminsted price,” which he says resulted in eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) shareholders losing more than $4 billion compared with how much Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) paid for the VoIP service provider. Icahn believes Donahoe would be fired if eBay was a private company and the “facts” about this were disclosed.Donahoe decided in 2009 to sell Skype after receiving offers from “multiple bidders.” Icahn isn’t sure whether there were “multiple bidders,” which eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) originally said or whether the company contacted a number of buyers, which the auction site now claims. The activist investor believes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was “clearly interested in buying Skype but ‘walked away’ because of concerns over technology licensing litigation between eBay and Sky’e founders.”Icahn said they discovered new litigation documents in which Donahoe and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) board member Marc Andreessen learned about a workaround of the licensed technology which caused Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to walk away. He states that Andreessen bought a controlling interest in Skype at that point for $1.9 billion, then settled the licensing litigation and “flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion—tripling their money in only 18 months.” The activist investor questions why Donahoe didn’t settle the issue and then just sell Skype directly to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).He then made the case for why PayPal should be separated from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), suggesting that there would be “a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal” and that if the payment services provider is left under eBay’s management, then it could “wither,” like BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) (TSE:BB), Dell, Nintendo and other technology companies.Donahoe has maintained that they should keep PayPal as a subsidiary, and his company launched a website—bettertogether.ebayinc.com—which puts forth his case for why the two companies should remain together. On the site, the company states that PayPal has grown faster with the auction site and that it generates about 30% of PayPal’s new users. The company also states that the auction site speeds up PayPal’s success and makes it “smarter.” In addition, it states that it funds the services provider’s growth.enter your info below & be subscribed to bothvaluewalk & valueinvestor.com (from ValueWalk)

70	"By Michelle ChapmanAssociated PressNEW YORK — McDonald's is fighting to hold onto customers in the U.S. — and all that snow didn't help.The world's biggest hamburger chain said Monday that sales fell 1.4 percent at established U.S. locations. It blamed the harsh winter weather, but conceded that ""challenging industry dynamics"" also played a role.After years of outperforming its rivals, McDonald's has been struggling to boost sales as people increasingly flock to places like Chipotle and Five Guys Burgers and Fries. Those chains have popped up quickly across the country by positioning themselves as a step up from traditional fast food, for a little extra money. They also offer greater customization, meaning diners can dictate exactly what toppings they want.Executives at McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., acknowledge Americans' changing eating habits.""A long time ago, mass appeal had to be mass appeal,"" Jeff Stratton, the president of McDonald's USA said in an interview with The Associated Press last month. ""That's not necessarily the case anymore today.""The restaurants are adapting to a world where McDonald's traditional strength — consistency — isn't always enough.For example, McDonald's is rolling out new prep tables that can hold more toppings and sauces, a sign that it plans to give customers greater variety.In Southern California, the company is even testing a ""build-your-own-burger"" concept that lets people use tablets to tap out the bread, cheese and other toppings they want on their burgers. Executives say results are promising so far, but rolling out the offering across its more than 14,000 U.S. locations would require considerable changes to kitchens.In the meantime, McDonald's has made other changes to its menu, including the option to get egg whites in breakfast sandwiches, and the rollout of chicken McWraps, which are intended to appeal to people who want fresher, healthier food.Globally, McDonald's said sales declined 0.3 percent at locations open at least 13 months in February. It warned that its muted performance so far this year could hurt first-quarter profit margins.In region encompassing the Middle East, Africa and Asia, sales declined 2.6 percent. The company cited weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as a shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.Europe was a relative bright spot, with sales up 0.6 percent on a strong performance in the U.K. and growth in France.McDonald's has more than 35,000 locations in more than 100 countries.Its stock shed 31 cents to $95.19 in morning trading.Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi"	Business

73	"The same-store sales results of McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) declined 0.3% in February as the company experienced weakness in the United States and Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA).According to the largest fast food chain operator, the sales performance of its segments in the United States and APMEA dropped 1.4% and 2.6% respectively while its segment in Europe rose 0.6%.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is experiencing challenges trying to increase its sales performance, particularly in the United States. Last January, the sales performance of the company’s U.S. fell 3.3%. CEO Don Thompson previously stated that McDonald’s needs to improve its menu offerings as it became less relevant to some customers.Today, Thompson reiterated that the growth priorities of McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) globally include optimizing menus, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening the accessibility to McDonald’s brands. According to him, these priorities are the foundation of the company’s customer-centric approach in building its business over the long-term.“We are intent on improving our business performance by thoughtfully evolving our approach to ensure that we are delivering the most compelling value, service and convenience to each of the approximately 70 million customers who choose McDonald’s each day,” added Thompson.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) explained that its U.S. sales was impacted by challenging industry dynamics and severe weather conditions last month. In APMEA, its sales were affected by weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as the shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.On the other hand, the largest food chain operator said its positive sale performance in Europe was due to the continued strong sales in the United Kingdom and France, which offset the ongoing weakness in Germany. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its European segment is benefiting from its local menu options, expanded convenience through breakfast and extended hours.Peter Bensen, chief financial officer at McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its relatively flat global comparable sales year-to-date will pressure margins in the first quarter. He emphasized that the company is “diligently strengthening” its performance, and he is confident that the management is taking the right actions to clearly align with customer’s needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitability.enter your info below & be subscribed to bothvaluewalk & valueinvestor.com (from ValueWalk)

. More importantly, analysts said the changing consumer preference to eat more healthy has left fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s struggling to make itself relevant for today’s consumers.According to the National Restaurant Association’s 2014 industry forecast, only 29% of quick-service restaurants forecast a rise in sales from last year’s level, versus 55% for fast-casual chain operators. And while 40% of quick service restaurants forecast profit declines this year, only 16% of fast-casual eateries feel that way. Half of fast casual chains think their profit will rise from 2013 level.“The U.S. consumer, and the global consumer, are changing and McDonald’s hasn’t kept up,” Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch.A case in point, pressured by declining mall traffic and changing consumer eating habits, pizza chain Sbarro on Monday  filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years.Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast food prices to rise this year by as much as 3.5%. It warned that the ongoing drought in California could have a significant and lasting effect on prices of fruit, vegetable, dairy, and eggs.To reverse waning demand, McDonald’s recently hired a new U.S. marketing chief to help it refine its pitch to consumers. Chief Executive Don Thompson  also is “enhancing the breakfast experience” at the chain to create “more of a coffee culture.” After the 20-piece nuggets promotions, the company is promoting five wings for $3 to clear its excess inventory. It also will be offering a new Bacon Clubhouse sandwich featuring Applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions. The company is also testing giving consumers the ability to customize their orders, taking a page from its rivals like Chipotle.U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, after a 3.3% drop in January. The unit has missed Wall Street expectations for seven straight months, according to Thomson Reuters. Overseas, European comparable sales were up 0.6%, while sales in Asia, Middle East and Africa dropped 2.6%. International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan. Meanwhile, as well as a stronger dollar, which made its food more expensive abroad.Without the weight of a stronger dollar, total world-wide sales would have risen 2.2% , instead of a 0.6% decline in February, the company said.Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald’s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.“We believe the current more challenging reality is reflected in valuation,” said Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein, who rates the stock overweight. “While not the strongest near-term performer, we expect
MCD to regain lost U.S. share in ‘14, and benefit from a European macro recovery.”McDonald’s shares dipped 0.4% to $95.11 Monday morning. They are down 3.6% during the past year, the third-worst Dow performer.

80	Reuters Staff3 Min ReadBy Phil Wahba March 10 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp on Monday reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales for February, hurt again by slow business in the United States. The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue said worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3  percent last month. That was below analysts’ average estimate for a fall of 0.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 1.4 percent, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts had forecast. McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said in a press release that the unchanged global comparable sales so far this year “will pressure margins” in the first quarter. McDonald’s has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service. That performance is heaping pressure on Don Thompson, the chief executive of McDonald’s since July 2012, who will face new challenges this year. Beef prices are hovering near record highs and expected to keep climbing. Labor costs also are increasing: several states have raised their minimum wage this year. Thompson said in a statement that McDonald’s is “intent on improving our business performance.” McDonald’s said it is trying to draw more customers by improving customer service and menu changes. McDonald’s is doubling down on breakfast and coffee to defend its No. 1 position in the United States as Starbucks Corp  debuts new breakfast sandwiches and Yum Brands’  Taco Bell chain gets into the game with food like waffle tacos. McDonald’s again blamed the intense cold and snow that hit large parts of the country, but analysts have been quick to point out that McDonald’s less-affluent U.S. patrons are still getting pinched by sluggish job growth and stagnant wages. In Europe, the company’s biggest market by revenue, restaurant sales last month rose 0.6 percent. Sales were down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region. Analysts looked for Europe to be down 0.1 percent and for APMEA to drop 1.1 percent. Sales in Britain and France led the way in Europe, while poor business in Japan weighed down sales in Asia. McDonald’s shares were down 0.4 percent Monday morning.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2018 Reuters. All Rights Reserved.	Business

In a near repeat of January’s results, February same-store sales for McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) U.S. stores fell and the company’s global sales were rescued by sales in Europe. U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, while sales in Europe rose 0.6% and sales in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) fell 2.6%. Overall global same-store sales were down 0.3% in February, compared with sales in February 2013.That is much worse than the January performance, where global same-store sales were up 1.2%, even though U.S. sales were down 3.3%. Europe and APMEA both grew sales in January by 2% and 5.4%, respectively, to offset the big decline in the United States.U.S. sales were down due to “challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather.” APMEA sales fell as a result of weaker sales in Japan, the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday and negative performance in Australia. The United Kingdom and France offset weaker sales in Germany to post a slight gain in European sales.The company’s CFO noted that year-to-date performance “will pressure margins in the first quarter.” That is not good news for shareholders.What is even worse news is that the company’s priorities do not appear to be having a significant positive impact on sales. In the fourth quarter of 2013, same-store sales fell 0.1% and consolidated net income was flat. U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% while rising 1% in Europe and falling by 2.4% in Asia. That is just about where the stores are at the end of February, and that is why the CFO is hinting that profits appear to be headed to finish no better than flat in the first quarter of this year.McDonald’s shares were down about 0.2% in premarket trading Monday, at $95.25 in a 52-week range of $92.22 to $103.70.By Paul Ausick"	Business

91	"We live blogged the  U.S. stock market\’s action on Monday. You can read a wrap of pre-market actions here and get a compact rundown of the stock market in Market Snapshot.Good morning.Stocks are mostly lower in the early going, with the S&P 500 pulling back from Friday’s record close.Reports of weaker-than-expected Chinese exports are getting much of the blame. Equities in Asia closed sharply lower today.SPX -4 pointsDow -50 pointsNasdaq -6 pointsBoeing    /quotes/zigman/220026/delayed /quotes/nls/ba BA    is helping push the Dow lower.It’s the worst-performing Dow component so far today, last down about 2%.  There’s been more trouble for the aircraft maker’s 787 — news of cracks in the wings of some planes.Photo credit: Getty ImagesAnother Dow component with news today is McDonald’s   /quotes/zigman/233369/delayed /quotes/nls/mcd MCD   , which reported a global drop in monthly same-store sales.U.S. sales were down 1.4%. Dow Jones Market Talk emphasized the domestic decline follows drops in December and January, and these performances are “concerning of course since the US remains far and away MCD’s biggest market.”Shares in McDonald’s were last down 0.3% — not a big drop, but still a drop.Photo credit: BloombergThe S&P 500 has picked itself up off its session low, but it’s still in negative territory. The benchmark index was last down 0.1%.The Dow fell out of the gate and has basically moved sideways. The blue-chip index was down 0.3% at last check.The Nasdaq has been dancing around the break-even mark, at times showing small gains, at times showing small losses. The tech-heavy index was last up 0.1%.While the S&P 500 eked out another record close on Friday, Colin Cieszynski doesn’t sound impressed.The senior analyst at CMC Markets apparently would have preferred a finish above 1,880.He writes in a note today:“SPX500 failed to hold a new high Friday above 1,880 and continues to roll over today. A negative RSI divergence suggests uptrend weakening. Initial support appears in the 1,850 to 1,855 previous resistance zone followed by 1,830.”In his note this morning, CMC’s Cieszynski also has an interesting take on McDonald’s   /quotes/zigman/233369/delayed /quotes/nls/mcd MCD    same-store sales falling 0.3% for February.The news “can be seen as a potentially positive indicator for the global economy,” he writes.“Just as more people tend to eat at McDonalds in recessions, the same people may elect to eat at more expensive restaurants when they have more money or feel more secure about the economy,” the analyst says.And for more about McDonald’s, check out what MarketWatch’s Catey Hill has to say about how the fast-food giant could become more like its old friend Chipotle   /quotes/zigman/395806/delayed /quotes/nls/cmg CMG    — namely by getting involved in the customization trend.Photo credit: BloombergThe bananas industry — that’s the latest sector with M&A news, joining cable, pharma, jewelry.Overall, the merger activity could show the mood in corporate boardrooms is optimistic.

Some analysts says data might be distorted by the celebration of Lunar New Year, however. Ongoing tension between Ukraine and Russia is also weighing on risky assets – as gold and Treasurys are gaining, while oil and equity markets are falling.SPX

 is the top gainer on the S&P 500 today. The stock rose 6.7% after the biopharmaceutical company boosted its 2014 adjusted earnings outlook. It also announced a reimbursement deal with the French government on its blood disorder medication that will result in additional sales of $88 million.The stock has gained nearly 35% since the start of the year and nearly doubled in the past 12 months.The S&P 500 has already cruised past Deutsche Bank’s year-end forecast of 1,850 and may have further to go, writes top strategist David Bianco in a Monday note. But the firm now expects the next 5%-plus move by stocks to be down, he says.In part, that’s because Deutsche Bank is worried by high price-to-earnings ratio, a continuing trend of earnings forecast downgrades and a lack of “higher quality” drivers for earnings per share and the price/equity ratio. Bianco would prefer to see EPS and P/E driven by increased capital expenditure and export growth as opposed to share buybacks. Read more here.The bull market’s fifth anniversary prompted many strategist reassess market conditions and valuations.Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial, in a research note, writes that margin debt is in elevated territory and and the conditions may be appropriate for a correction.Margin debt is important for several reasons. First, available and cheap financing allows investors to buy more, which, in a virtuous circle, can lead to more demand and higher prices. If, however, prices start to decline, the debt still has to be repaid. So investors sell to raise cash, which pushes prices down, and so on. Debt raises the possibility of a downward spiral, and can make a spiral more severe when it happens.The other reason margin debt is important is it reflects investors’ attitude toward risk. By taking on more debt, investors are showing they expect stocks to rise and do not believe risks are that high—which lasts until the market turns. Just as with debt, the change in sentiment can drive prices down even faster than they rose.I will write next week about indicators that can actually show when to worry about the market in the short term, but the level of margin debt is not one of them. It is, however, an indicator you should keep an eye on in the medium and longer term.This year it is supposed to be all about U.S. economic growth, but investors and economists had to adjust their expectations after weak readings from pretty much all government reports in the past few months.The White House’s economic team expects the economy to improve and the main reason behind it is household deleveraging.

92	"What a difference five years makes.Five years ago Sunday, the stock market
indexes toppled to their low points of recent times, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average hitting 6,547.10 on March 9, 2009 -- less than
half of what it had been 17 months earlier. The S&P 500, meanwhile, dipped
to 676.53, also far less than half of what it had been in October 2007,
when it had soared to 1,565.15.* Download the above chart in full-sizeToday, the indexes are hitting new highs almost every
week, as the Dow stands at more than 16,400 and the S&P is at more than
1,875.Many of our local companies have enjoyed a
similar ride with their stocks in the last five years, as share prices have
soared and dividends have increased in many cases.The chart below looks at the total five-year
return of 62 area companies. Most are in Greater Cleveland. A few are outside
the immediate region but are of keen interest to local investors, consumers and
workers. The total return includes appreciation in the share price and
income including dividends. So if you invested $1,000 in a stock back in
March 2009 and the return since then was 100 percent, you'd have $2,000. If the
total return in the last five years was 2,738 percent, as is the case with
Polyone Corp. of Avon Lake, your $1,000 investment would now be worth
$28,380. If you'd invested the same $1,000 with Cedar
Fair, parent of Cedar Point, your investment would now be worth $11,240. In
many cases, the returns wouldn't be quite so incredible: $1,000 then in J.M.
Smucker or Progressive Corp. or A Schulman of Fairlawn would be worth about
$3,000 today.In some cases, the fabulous returns are a
reflection of how low the stock has sunk during the financial meltdown of 2008
and early 2009. In other cases, the return reflects how well the company has
done since then.Likewise, at the bottom of the list: In a few
cases, the companies haven't performed well in the last five years. In other cases, like CBIZ Inc. of Independence,
the company's stock price didn't fall much during the meltdown (only about 19
percent) and has gained since then (40 percent), but the growth has been more
modest compared with other companies that plummeted and then rebounded. In the case of FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, the
electric utility has been undergoing a turnaround after posting big losses in
2012. Your $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth only $1,070 today.The five-year returns are through Thurs., March 6; the
share prices and year-to-date returns are as of Wed., March 5.More Top Workplaces »We look forward to sharing with you some of the great content found on cleveland.com.  To view and subscribe to any of our other newsletters, please click here.

93	"|E-PaperNew York: Global stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1% from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report.China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the US Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1501241483022-0'); });Prices on benchmark 10-year US treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78%.The commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China.In the US stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.96 points or 0.5%, to 16,369.76, the S&P 500 lost 6.41 points or 0.34%, to 1,871.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.561 points or 0.38%, to 4,319.662. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday.Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.2% to $31.16 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6%.European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5%, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.5% and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3%.German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3%, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in China, the world’s top commodity buyer.“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.Adding to the day’s concerns, in Crimea unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post, in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula.Russia said the US had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis.On Wall Street, Boeing Co. shares lost 2.3% to $125.62 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said late Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet.Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 1.7% at $23. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice-president, global communications and investor relations.Chinese Data Weighs On Australian, Canadian Dollars
The Aussie traded 0.4% lower at $0.9031, while the loonie was down 0.2% at $1.1104.“The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning—you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” said Alvin Tann, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.The yuan earlier fell as much as 0.5% and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.The US dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that the US job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was little changed at 79.75.In the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since 25 June and within a hair of nearly three-year lows.Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30% in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27% from last year’s levels.The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude was trading 79 cents lower at $108.23. The US oil fell $1.25 to $101.33 a barrel. Reuters

94	"Returns as of 1/27/2018Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Returns as of 1/27/2018Today, the stock market opened lower on fears of global economic sluggishness, with the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) falling 72 points as of 12:30 p.m. EDT and the S&P 500Â declining from Friday's record close. Yet in light of the longer-term trends that helped the Dow's bull market reach the ripe old age of 5 yesterday, many investors are looking forward to the beginning of the first-quarter earnings season for signals about whether the blue-chip index has further to climb in the months and years ahead.Image Source: Jenni Jones/Flickr.Will winter ever end? The main storyline that most investors have followed closely during the first quarter is the impact of harsh winter weather on the economy. Already we've seen countless companies cite weather problems to justify sluggish results, with even major producers citing issues that could hurt first-quarter earnings. For instance, automaker Ford (NYSE:F) said last week that delays in fleet orders due to the winter weather played a sizable role in the company's overall 6% drop in total sales in February from year-ago levels. Many retailers have issued similar warnings, with the latest earnings insight report [opens PDF] from FactSet revealing that 86 companies in the S&P 500 have given negative guidance on first-quarter earnings per share.On the whole, earnings growth for the first quarter is now seen coming in at just 0.5%, down from expectations of 4.4% at the beginning of the year. Consumer-discretionary stocks such as Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have seen some of the biggest downward revisions, with GM cutting its earnings estimates nearly in half. Among S&P sectors, only utilities have seen higher expected earnings growth, and those stocks obviously aren't included in the Dow Industrials. Yet in the past, a recurring theme has played itself out over and over again: earnings expectations fall in the period leading up to the time at which companies actually start to report results, but then companies are able to beat those modest expectations, sending actual earnings growth higher by the end of earnings season.From that perspective, the early reporting companies in the Dow will have a lot of insight to give to investors. Nike (NYSE:NKE) reports next week, and investors expect to see a substantial rise in sales accompanied by a slight decline in earnings from year-ago levels. Those results would be very much in line with what retailers reported recently, as heavy promotional activity has hurt margins. Even though Nike's strong brand value should help it maintain revenue growth more easily than some competitors, even the athletic-apparel giant has to deal with shoppers who don't want to venture into the cold.Bank stocks will also be among the earliest to issue earnings numbers, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) slated to report on April 11. Banks will have lower hurdles to overcome, as investors already expect headwinds from falling levels of mortgage refinancing to have substantial year-over-year impacts on earnings. Yet housing has been relatively resilient so far, raising the hope that new-purchase mortgages can pick up the slack and help boost overall earnings. With financial stocks among the leaders of the latest push up for the Dow, JPMorgan and its peers need to deliver on their promise in order to keep the bull market going.Are markets too expensive? The other question earnings season should help answer is whether the Dow has simply risen too far. After such strong gains since 2009, concerns about extreme valuations for stocks have risen to new heights. Yet in driving prices higher, earnings have also posted substantial gains, with forward earnings estimates almost doubling since the 2009 lows. Indeed, FactSet noted that current forward multiples are actually below their 15-year average, albeit with that period including not only inflated late-1990s projections but also the boom markets of the mid-2000s.Those who would like the 5-year-old bull market to reach its next birthday hope that earnings can keep growing enough to satisfy gun-shy investors who grow more nervous at every new record high. First-quarter earnings season will reveal some useful secrets in determining whether the Dow can keep climbing or whether investors should brace for tough times ahead.Dan Caplinger owns shares of Ford.

95	"NEW YORK: US stocks Monday fell in early trade following disappointing economic data from China and Japan and continued tension over Ukraine.About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 47.92 (0.29 percent) to 16,404.80.The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 2.09 (0.11 percent) to 1,875.95, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.37 (0.01 percent) lower to 4,335.85.Weekend economic data from China raised questions about the outlook for the world's second largest economy.Beijing reported weak inflation data and a $23.0 billion trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $11.9 billion surplus.

102	"How an old company is embracing the cutting-edgeWhat's different when I file this year?Join the NASDAQ Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!Benchmarks ended Friday's trading session on a mixed note. The S&P 500 and Dow gained modestly on the back of better-than-expected nonfarm payroll data. These marginal gains were strong enough for the S&P 500 to hit another record high for the second consecutive day. Investors were also kept on the edge by recent developments in the Crimea region; leading to a volatile trading session.
 For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's Ahead of Wall Street article
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.2% to close Friday's trading session at 16,452.72. The Standard & Poor (S&P 500) edged up 0.1% to finish at 1,878.04. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4% to 4,336.22. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped 0.7% to settle at 14.11. Total volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.5 billion shares. Advancing stocks were outnumbered by declining stocks on the NYSE. For 41% stocks that advanced, 56% declined.
 For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 1.0% and the Dow posted a gain of 0.8%. The Nasdaq gained for the fifth-straight week and has improved 0.7% since last Friday. The benchmarks managed to remain in the positive territory through the week as tension between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea region subsided. Following these developments, investors have been confident enough to invest in equities rather than traditional safe-haven assets.
 The new agreemenmt between The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) and Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH ) has added to the bullish mood. The European Central Bank and the Central Bank of United Kingdom's decisions to not change the key lending rates were welcomed by investors. There were mixed reports on the economic front; which investors overlooked as an outcome of the bitter winter season.
 Coming back to Friday's events, US stocks began the day on an upbeat note following a better-than-expected nonfarm payroll report for February. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payroll employment had risen to 175,000 in February from 129,000 in January. The rise came despite the harsh winter weather. The increase was more than the consensus estimate of a jump to 152,000.
 This report from the Labor Department pushed the S&P 500 to an intraday record of 1,883.57. However, the benchmarks gave away some of the gains as investors remained apprehensive about the US Federal Reserve's next possible move following better jobs data. The Fed's next  policy meeting will take place later this month.
 The Labor Department also reported that unemployment rate had edged up to 6.7% in February from 6.6% in January. This rise in unemployment rate was the first increase in 14 months and was more than the consensus estimate of it remaining flat at 6.6%.
 Meanwhile, consumer credit increased 5.3% or $13.7 billion in January according to the Federal Reserve. However, the increase in the indicator of potential future spending levels was slightly less than the consensus estimate of an increase by $14 billion.
 Separately, the Department of Commerce reported a deficit in goods and services of $39.1 billion in January, up from revised $39.0 billion in December. This rise in the country's largest component of balance of payments was also more than the consensus estimate of $37 billion.
 Investors also kept an eye on the developments in the Crimea region where a referendum on whether or not to split the region from Ukraine and make it a part of Russia is possibly being prepared. Geo-political concerns surged when Russian President Vladimir Putin turned down a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over movement of Russian troops in the Crimea region.
 Five out of ten sectors of the S&P 500 ended in green. Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) led the gains as the sector rose 0.5%. Top holdings from the sector such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) and American Express Company and (NYSE: AXP ) increased 1.3%, 0.9%, 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively.
 Among the declining stocks, SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) led the decline as the sector fell 0.5%. Key stocks from the sector such as USG Corporation (NYSE: USG ), DR Horton Inc. (NYSE: DHI ), NVR, Inc. (NYSE: NVR ) and Lennar Corp. (NYSE: LEN ) decreased 2.4%. 1.6%. 0.6% and 1.9%, respectively.

109	International / 10 March 2014, 5:09pm / Chuck MikolajczakNew York - US stocks edged modestly lower on Monday, and the S&P 500 held near record highs, as investors largely shrugged off unexpectedly weak data in China. China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide. “We did shrug off the (China data), almost as if was a non-event,” said Peter Kenny, chief executive of Clearpool Group in New York. “I don't think it's disruptive to the way people are looking at China as an economy that has lost some of its hyperbolic move and that is almost welcome.” Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.6 percent to $31.35 as signs of a slowing China sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.4 percent. Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P's 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades. “That five-year anniversary has given market investors a sense of pause rather than a sense of enthusiasm because there is still this lingering fear that resides in the approach people have with the market - have we come too far, too fast? Are valuations justified?” said Kenny. In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 67.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,385.29, the S&P 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,873.58 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 6.551 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,329.672. McDonald's Corp slipped 0.3 percent to $95.25 after the hamburger chain reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales. Boeing Co shares lost 1.9 percent to $126.10 as the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company's newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday. Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe's largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world's biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 14.6 percent to $12.42. United Rentals Inc, gained 3.9 percent to $91.98 after the world's largest equipment rental company said it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.

Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P;’s 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades. “That five-year anniversary has given market investors a sense of pause rather than a sense of enthusiasm because there is still this lingering fear that resides in the approach people have with the market - have we come too far, too fast? Are valuations justified?” said Kenny. In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 67.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,385.29, the S&P; 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,873.58 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 6.551 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,329.672. McDonald’s Corp slipped 0.3 percent to $95.25 after the hamburger chain reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales. Boeing Co shares lost 1.9 percent to $126.10 as the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P; 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday. Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe’s largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world’s biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 14.6 percent to $12.42. United Rentals Inc, gained 3.9 percent to $91.98 after the world’s largest equipment rental company said it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

111	"Wednesday, February 7th, 2018.Five years ago today the stock market, reeling from the financial crisis, hit bottom. The Dow (^DJI) closed at just under 6,500 and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended at 676.5. Since March 9, 2009, the Dow and the S&P 500 have more than doubled but how much longer can this rally last?No one knows the answer, of course, but there are reasons to be cautious. Here are five of them:1. Tenure: The average bull market lasts about 4.5 years. Only three of the 11 previous bull markets (excluding this one), celebrated a sixth birthday.2. Valuation: Profit growth is slowing and revenue growth is sluggish, but the price-to-earnings-ratio for the S&P 500 is still strong--about 16 times earnings for the past 12 months. That's near the peak reached in October 2007, just before stocks began their decline during the financial crisis.3. Margin debt: It's been rising since June and reached a record $488 billion in January. Investors are borrowing to invest, which is a euphoric sign, says Phil Pearlman, interactive editor at Yahoo Finance. And too much euphoria in the stock market is considered a sign of vulnerability. But Pearlman notes that a major reason for rising margin debt is that the cheap cost of borrowing due to extremely low interest rates.4. The Fed: the U.S. central bank is reducing its purchases of mortgage debt and long-term Treasuries, which have kept long-term rates low and helped fuel the stock market rally. Many strategists say Fed policy is THE key factor for the stock market rally so less Fed asset purchases means less support for the rally.5. Biotech weakening. Pearlman says biotech stocks have been a leader in the bull market but have been selling off lately. Over the past two weeks the Nasdaq Biotech index (IBB) has fallen 2.3% while the Nasdaq has gained 1.6% and the S&P 500 and Dow are both up about 2%.Biotechs have been lagging big-cap growth stocks like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Priceline (PCLN) and Netflix (NFLX), which have also outperformed in the current rally, says Pearlman. ""Keep an eye on biotechs and large-cap growth stocks,"" he warns. ""When they [both] start to roll over that would be a second signal that momentum is waning.""Follow The Daily Ticker on Facebook and Twitter (@DailytTcker)!More from The Daily TickerGet ready for a bigger push in Washington to raise the minimum wageJobs better-than-expected but ""the labor market is still weak"": NYT's Greenhouse'Bond King' tarnishes his crown: Gross is undermining PIMCO, Macke says"	Business

MarketsFOX Business: Capitalism Lives HereContinue Reading BelowU.S. equity markets stumbled on Monday after weaker-than-expected export data from China spooked Wall Street traders.Today's MarketsAs of 11:56 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 79.4 points, or 0.48%, to 16373, the S&P 500 slumped 6.5 points, or 0.35%, to 1872 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 14.1 points, or 0.32%, to 4322.The broad S&P 500 closed at yet another record high last week, climbing 1%. The monthly jobs report, which is considered one of Wall Street's most important gauges, showed the American economy added more jobs than expected last month, helping traders shake off worries that the recent bout of weakness was sparked by more than temporary factors. A report on Chinese trade, however, once again sparked concerns about the global economy. The world's No. 2 economy saw its exports plummet 18.1% on year-over-year basis in February, compared to expectations they would rise 7.5%. Japan's fourth-quarter growth was also revised down to an annual rate of 0.7% from 1%. Continue Reading BelowADVERTISEMENTEquity markets in Asia had a tough session: The Japanese Nikkei 225 slid 1%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng dropped 1.8% and the Shanghai Shenzhen 300 tumbled 3.3%. The U.S. economic docket is bare on the day.

116	Tara Clarke: The stock market crash this week that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S. stock markets.Subprime financial crisis-related events would ultimately become responsible for five out of the top ten biggest single-day Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market crashes, including the top two spots.After the Dow Jones hit an (at the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 – a little under 18 months later.U.S. markets hit their lowest point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point is this Sunday.Since that day, U.S. markets have skyrocketed. The S&P 500 Index is up 174.7% (1,193.85 points), the Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and the Nasdaq is up 235% (3,040.5).In fact, as of this week, the bull market – defined as a period in which the S&P 500 gains 20% or more – ranks as the sixth longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group research.However, the longer this rally lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least an official stock market correction – defined as a decline of 10% or more.“I am very concerned about a correction right now,” Money Morning Chief Financial Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald said on Friday. “The past few weeks have seen higher prices and lower volume. This is like climbing a mountain into thin air – every step higher gets harder. Sooner or later, the markets are going to have to take a breather and turn around.”Here are the three signs that have investors worried we’re due for a stock market crash or correction soon…First, many investors are nervous about the duration of this bull market.Most last from 50 to 67 months. The bull market that began in 1982 lasted about 60 months before the 1987 stock market crash. The bull market that began in 2002 lasted 60 months to a high in 2007.And eerily, yesterday (Thursday), our current bull market hit its 60-month anniversary. The past two bull markets were immediately followed by crushing bear markets, and 2009’s fallout was the biggest since the Great Depression.Second, investors are nervous about the lack of market correction.A market correction hasn’t happened since October 2011 – that’s a 29-month stretch.Historically, corrections occur every 18 months, according to S&P Capital IQ.“The longer we go without resetting the dial, the greater the likelihood of a steeper correction, and the greater likelihood that it becomes a bear market,” S&P Capital IQ chief equity strategist Sam Stovall said to USA Today.The third and final sign making investors wary of a stock market crash is U.S. Federal Reserve action. Since initiating its quantitative easing (QE) program in 2008, the Fed has managed to plump its balance sheet to somewhere over $4 trillion.In December 2013, the Fed announced its intent to begin unwinding QE by tapering its monthly bond purchases. Since January, the Fed has cut its bond buying by $10 billion a month (to $75 billion).That tapering is likely to negatively impact equity markets as fewer U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities are purchased each month.Even though investors may give pause to the possibility of a stock market crash or correction, they should nonetheless stay invested – just with caution.“You have to be in it to win it. I am urging people to raise stops and play very conservatively right now. But, do stay ready to buy,” Fitz-Gerald said. “Going forward, look to financials, tech, healthcare, and defense stocks.”Written By Tara Clarke From Money MorningWe’re in the midst of the greatest investing boom in almost 60 years. And rest assured – this boom is not about to end anytime soon. You see, the flattening of the world continues to spawn new markets worth trillions of dollars; new customers that measure in the billions; an insatiable global demand for basic resources that’s growing exponentially; and a technological revolution even in the most distant markets on the planet.And MoneyMorning is here to help investors profit handsomely on this seismic shift in theglobal economy.

117	"March 10, 2014, BY Thomas H. Kee Jr - Editor, Stock Traders Daily |  Subscribe to RSSRecent headlines make you believe that the market has been doing exceptional, and it is had a nice run recently, but let's get real.  The Dow Jones industrial average (NYSE:DIA) has barely increased by 3% annually on average since January 1, 2000, and that beats the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and NASDAQ (NYSE:QQQ) handily.  In addition, if current sentiment has anything to do with it, another major peak may be on the horizon.Smaller investors are greedier today than they have been in quite a long time.  My business is one that is constantly monitoring these smaller investors, be it through their responses through social media, traditional media outlets, market based financial articles, television, or through the real time trading reports that we publish for individual stocks, and in keeping my finger on the pulse of these smaller investors I often find contrarian indicators that are actionable from time to time. This might be one of those times.
The epitome might be a conversation I had with one of my best friends, who said real estate would never fall again.  Clearly, the sentiment on the street is not limited to the stock market, it is based on asset price increases from virtually all asset classes, but my primary business is the stock market, and as stock market investors come across my plate I find that every one of them, with the exception of a very small niche, are actually expecting to get 15 or 20% a year from their stock market investments.
To anyone experienced in this industry, that's an eye opener.  The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 17% since September, 2007 (that all came last year), and it is up only 43% since January 1, 2000 (when I started stock traders daily).  Said another way, the Dow Jones industrial average has averaged about 3% a year since the turn of the millennium, plus dividends of course.
During that time it has had its share of collapses and recoveries, and a resounding similarity occurs after every recovery.  Somewhere near the peak, smaller investors begin to get extremely greedy.  They become overly confident, and they start to throw caution to the wind.  On the other side of the coin, when everything looks ugly, smaller investors get defensive, but in each case that is almost exactly the opposite of what they should be doing.  When everything is ugly, investors should be aggressive and taking positions to buy the market, and when the market is at relative peaks and everyone else is greedy, prudent investors should become defensive.
Given what I know about today's environment, the greedy sentiment on the street today is very similar to the over exuberance that I have been witness to many times during the life span of my business.  The boom and bust cycles are almost predicated on sentiment sometimes, and if that is true this time we will soon see a peak in the market that will last for quite awhile.This might be one of those times.The epitome might be a conversation I had with one of my best friends, who said real estate would never fall again.  Clearly, the sentiment on the street is not limited to the stock market, it is based on asset price increases from virtually all asset classes, but my primary business is the stock market, and as stock market investors come across my plate I find that every one of them, with the exception of a very small niche, are actually expecting to get 15 or 20% a year from their stock market investments.To anyone experienced in this industry, that's an eye opener.  The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 17% since September, 2007 (that all came last year), and it is up only 43% since January 1, 2000 (when I started stock traders daily).  Said another way, the Dow Jones industrial average has averaged about 3% a year since the turn of the millennium, plus dividends of course.During that time it has had its share of collapses and recoveries, and a resounding similarity occurs after every recovery.  Somewhere near the peak, smaller investors begin to get extremely greedy.  They become overly confident, and they start to throw caution to the wind.  On the other side of the coin, when everything looks ugly, smaller investors get defensive, but in each case that is almost exactly the opposite of what they should be doing.  When everything is ugly, investors should be aggressive and taking positions to buy the market, and when the market is at relative peaks and everyone else is greedy, prudent investors should become defensive.Given what I know about today's environment, the greedy sentiment on the street today is very similar to the over exuberance that I have been witness to many times during the life span of my business.  The boom and bust cycles are almost predicated on sentiment sometimes, and if that is true this time we will soon see a peak in the market that will last for quite awhile.

120	"Last week was another week where four out of five major equity averages achieved new all-time or multiyear intraday highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (1,6452.72) was the exception still lagging its all-time high at 1,6588.25 on Dec. 31.The S&P 500 (1,878.04) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (7,592.36) set new all-time intraday highs at 1883.57 and 7627.44 respectively on Friday.As U.S. Treasury yields rose last week, the Dow Utility Average (514.39) lost its leadership slipping into second place year-to-date with a gain of 4.8% down from 5.7% the prior week. The 2014 leader among the averages and indices I follow is now the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) (574.39) up 7.4% on the year setting a new multiyear intraday high at 577.64 on Friday.In this market environment there were five trades last week in the premium ValuTrader Model Portfolio advisory. The long-side of the model portfolio was reduced to 13 long positions in 7 stocks, four being components of the Dow Industrial Average. Two stocks on this week’s ValuTrader Watch List are also Dow components.Here’s a summary of last week’s trades:

Kinross Gold
 was removed from the model portfolio last Monday, March 3 on a good 'til canceled (GTC) limit order to sell strength to my weekly risky level at $5.31. The open that day was $5.36 where the exit price was set for a gain of 19.1%. This proved to be a prudent exit as the stock ended the week at $4.89. This stock could not sustain gains above its 200-day simple moving average at $5.08 and its 50-day SMA is $4.78.


Cirrus Logic
 continues to be actively traded by my methodology. On January 28 a second position in this stock was removed from the model portfolio on a GTC limit order to sell strength to $19.67 for a gain of 7.7%. This position re-entered the model portfolio on a GTC limit order to buy weakness to my annual value level at $18.84 on March 3.The stock still has a buy rating according to ValuEngine with a one-year price target at $20.41.

Weighing on stocks was a report from China, the world’s second-largest economy, over the weekend that showed its exports unexpectedly skidded 18.1% in February over a year earlier. Economists had expected an increase of 5%. The surprise drop also hit copper prices. “In the short term, China’s trade data was disappointing, however, at this point it is unclear how much of it was distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday,” said John De Clue, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “U.S. equities still remain the market of choice for a lot of international money, which is why we have seen more multiple expansion over the past few weeks,” he added.

Nevertheless, key trend line resistance on the DJT average currently sits at 9,515 and rises over time.That represents a potential 24% advance above current levels. It does not mean, however, that a move up to the 9,500 area is likely to emerge anytime soon, but it does represent an underlying optimism in equities that persists.At this point in time, geopolitical and weather related issues continue to cloud future expectations for growth. That, in turn, has held trading volumes within a normal or even muted range.Still, another facet of Dow Theory suggests that rising equity prices are usually accompanied by rising trading volumes which act as a confirmation to the prevailing bullish trend.As a result, it would not be surprising to see a rise in trading volumes if and when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P; 500 Index break above their long term trend line resistance levels currently sitting at 16,677 and 1,885 respectively.

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed to lower
open on Monday, despite the rally created by upbeat U.S. employment
data on Friday, as a disappointing trade balance report from China
weighed on sentiment.
Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.10% fall,
while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.03% gain.
The Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy
added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000
new jobs.makeArticleAd();
However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese
exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February,
confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of
10.6% in January.
A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in
China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.
The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second
largest economy.
Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced
Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive
Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about
30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than
PCs.
That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in
2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in
pre-market trade, down 0.25%.
The energy sector was also slated to be in focus, following
reports that BP is now the biggest loser among U.S. government
vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel
supplier.
Bloomberg reported that a combination of no big contracts
awarded and promised military work withdrawn left BP with a net
loss of $654 million in federal contracts in the year that ended
September 30, compared with $2.51 billion in awards in fiscal
2012.
Elsewhere, Boeing shares tumbled 1.98% in early trading after a
777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia
Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8.
Other stocks likely to be in focus included Urban Outfitters,
scheduled to report quarterly results later in the day.

These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.Visit performance for information about the performance numbers displayed above.Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.Real time prices by BATS.

Dow Jones industrial average futures  shed 28 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1 point. * McDonald’s Corp reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales. * Boeing Co shares lost 1.2 percent to $127.06 in premarket trading after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday. * The situation in Ukraine remained unsettled. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday it was outraged by lawlessness in eastern Ukraine, blaming the far-right paramilitary movement Right Sector for “conniving” with the new government in Kiev. Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution. * Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe’s largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world’s biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 18.1 percent to $12.80 in premarket trade. * United Rentals Inc, the world’s largest equipment rental company, said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser spoke earlier out of Paris, saying the pace of tapering may be too slow. Last week, Plosser said in an interview that he was worried about how the central bank’s asset purchases are affecting the U.S. economy. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak at 12:40 p.m. Eastern at Columbus State University. The Wall Street Journal’s Jon Hilsenrath said Monday that Fed officials are shifting their outlook on how to normalize monetary policy. So far, Monday has been somewhat of a tug-of-war between some surprising trade numbers out of China and Friday’s better-than-expected jobs report. Wall Street stocks closed mostly higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 index

Data over the weekend showed Chinese exports unexpectedly fell 18.1% in February, compared with a year earlier, which left a trade deficit of $22.98 billion for the month. Economists had been expecting an expansion of 5%, and the number was also well off a rise of 10.6% in January.“The shock drop in exports raises serious questions about how realistic Chinese growth prospects are and casts doubt on their current target,” said Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor. “This increased uncertainty is not helpful for either the commodity market or wider global-equity markets.”Asian markets fell sharply, with the Shanghai Composite Index

That string of S&P 500 highs, along with levels of margin debt and a small number of prior bull markets that have made it this far, are among reasons why some investors are wary. Hughes said that markets were also ignoring negative data that arrived in 2008, near the beginning of the euro crisis. While investors will be keeping an eye on geopolitical situations such as Ukraine, at the moment, he said it is just hard to bet against the market.Shares of Chiquita Brands International Inc.

140	"Menu On Friday, stocks closed mixed following a positive week that saw new highs in a majority of the widely followed indices. Friday’s non-farm payrolls report showed an increase of 175,000 jobs in February versus an expected 152,000. But the unemployment rate rose to 6.7% from 6.6% in January.The Nasdaq was weak as a second day of profit-taking in the biotech sector coupled with weakness late in the day in other technology stocks kept a lid on a possible recovery. The S&P 500 held onto its gains thanks to strength in the financial sector, which posted a 3% gain for the week.At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31 points to 16,453, the S&P 500 rose 1 point to 1,878, and the Nasdaq fell 16 points to 4,336. The NYSE’s primary market traded 723 million shares with total volume of 3.6 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 2.1 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners outpaced advancers by 1.3-to-1, while on the Nasdaq, there were only slightly more decliners than advancers.For the week, the Dow rose 0.8%, the S&P 500 gained 1%, the Nasdaq was up 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 gained 1.7%.
Click to EnlargeThe Nasdaq broke to a new 13-year closing high on Thursday but gave back the gains on Friday. The index is slowing its advance slightly, and that is showing in MACD and other momentum indicators. Immediate support rests at the 20-day moving average, and a fall to that level would close the gap opened earlier in the week.
Click to EnlargeThe Russell 2000 broke to new intraday and closing highs last week. The breakout was from a very bullish “V” formation that bottomed precisely at its intermediate trendline early in February. Both MACD and momentum are strong, but a small horn formation has developed, which could slow the advance until that is resolved.Conclusion: Despite economic and political uncertainties, stocks continue to make new highs. The advance is characteristic of a bull market that has considerable strength behind it. Institutional interest is demonstrated by higher-than-average block trading, while average investors’ bearishness increased by over 5% last week, according to AAII’s sentiment survey.I focused on the small- and mid-cap stocks for this report, but the broad-based S&P 500 scored four consecutive new intraday highs last week. The highs were accompanied by higher volume, and group rotation was very active.Everything points to higher prices, but that doesn’t mean that daily adjustments won’t occur. When they do, we should use them to take new positions in high-quality, oversold stocks. Patience is the key to success, and chasing stocks that are making new highs is a high-risk proposition in a stock market that is celebrating its fifth year as a bull.To see a list of the companies reporting earnings today, click here.For a list of this week’s economic reports due out, click here.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2014/03/daily-stock-market-news-dont-chase-stocks-five-year-old-bull/.©2018 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

141	"|E-PaperMumbai: US jobs figures cleared some of the clouds over the country’s economic outlook on Friday raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold firm in gradually scaling back its support for the recovery, reports Financial Times. 175,000 jobs were added in February up from 129,000 in January and 84,000 in December. The S&P 500 gained 0.1%, Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4% and Dow Jones Industrial was up 0.2%.Asian markets were trading lower on Monday morning following weak data from China and Japan.

I can live with that! I have now gone a solid 20 out of 24 over the past eight weeks.Let me once again whip out my trusty, dusty, and occasionally accurate crystal ball to make three calls that may play out over the next few trading days.1. Novavax will post a wider loss than expected Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) is a widely traded maker of vaccines. It moved higher late last month after extending its contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences to develop seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.Unfortunately, Novavax is losing money, and analysts seem to underestimate the red ink. Wall Street has failed to nail its projections when it comes to Novavax, aiming for a much smaller deficit than what the vaccine maker ultimately reports.Why get in the way of a long-running streak? My first call is for Novavax to post a wider quarterly loss than Wall Street's projecting this week.2. The Nasdaq will beat the Dow this week  I've routinely picked the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but I've been switching things out in recent weeks. I'm going back to my original call this time around, betting on a strong week for tech now that earnings season is starting to wind down. This approach didn't pan out for me this past week, but that won't deter me.My second call is for the Nasdaq Composite to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the week.3. magicJack VocalTec will beat Wall Street's earnings estimates Some stocks are just flat-out better than others.magicJack VocalTec (NASDAQ:CALL) is a provider of Web-based phone services. Consumers looking to save money have been ditching traditional landlines, and the VoIP pioneer has sold 10 million of its magicJack devices.Another thing it does is make analysts look like perpetual underachievers. If analysts say the company posted a profit of $0.19 a share in its latest quarter, I'll argue that it held up better than that. History's on my side!One of my best tricks to beating the market is finding stocks that perpetually land ahead of the prognosticators. Let's go over the past year of earnings reports.EPS EstimateEPSSurpriseQ4 2012$0.60$0.9558%Q1 2013$0.51$1.17129%Q2 2013$0.32$0.4953%Q3 2013$0.42$0.4814%Source: Thomson Reuters.Things can change, of course. Analysts are starting to catch up as the strength of the bottom-line beats have weakened in each of the past two quarters. This is a competitive market, and it bears pointing out that analysts see magicJack VocalTec earning less than half as much as it did a year earlier.It's still hard to argue against the trend. Everything seems to be falling into place for another market-thumping quarter on the bottom line. Rick Munarriz owns shares of Ambarella. The Motley Fool recommends and owns shares of Ambarella.

The first is the labor participation rate, which has been falling consistently for the past 14 years. Some of this drop is expected as baby boomers hit their retirement age and others go back to school, but a growing concern is that some people have simply given up on finding work. Comparing the current number of employed workers with those in mid-2008, you'd see that job creation is basically flat.Second, the Federal Reserve's economic stimulus, QE3, has been a boost for the housing and banking sector, but has spoiled the U.S. consumer by keeping rates too low for too long, By artificially keeping rates low and reducing this sense of urgency, consumers have drastically cut back on loan originations anytime lending rates tick up in the slightest.Finally, a combination of stock buybacks and cost-cutting has helped push corporate earnings higher, but it's also masking what has generally been weak organic growth.With these points in mind, I suggest we do what we do every month, which is to take a closer look at the Dow's five most hated companies -- in essence, the five stocks with the highest level of short interest -- to better understand what characteristics, if any, are attracting short-sellers so we can avoid buying similar stocks in the future.Here are the Dow's five most hated stocks.CompanyShort Interest As a % of Outstanding SharesCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT)5.96%Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)4.20%AT&T3.29%Verizon (NYSE:VZ)2.90%IBM (NYSE:IBM)2.58%Source: S&P Capital IQ.Caterpillar Why are investors shorting Caterpillar?Is this short interest warranted?Patrick Gelsinger, Intel Sr. VP, Source: Intel.Intel Why are investors shorting Intel?Is this short interest warranted?AT&T Why are investors shorting AT&T?Is this short interest warranted?Verizon Why are investors shorting Verizon?Is this short interest warranted?IBM Why are investors shorting IBM?Is this short interest warranted?Sean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.

144	"Returns as of 1/27/2018Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Returns as of 1/27/2018Ukraine and Russia were the talk of the markets this week and made for some wild trading. Stocks were down big Monday when tensions increased, but Tuesday was one of the best days of the year, and by the end of the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 0.80%.Russia is the world's largest oil producer, so it's worth keeping an eye on how it handles Ukraine and the region of Crimea, but the harsh drop of Russian stocks and the ruble on Monday may have been the warning it needed to not escalate the conflict. Russia's economy is on fragile ground, and markets showed that they'd crush Russian assets if a military conflict erupts.While Russia garnered headlines, it was financial stocks that led the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher this week. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was the top stock, gaining 4.7%. Outside of hiring Apple's retiring CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for its board of directors, there wasn't a lot of news out about Goldman this week. Goldman continues to benefit from the strong market for underwriting stock and bond offerings, and as long as the economy continues to improve, the finance giant will fare well.JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) rose 4.5% this week and settled another lawsuit. The company agreed to pay $400 million to Syncora Guarantee to settle mortgage-backed-securities lawsuits. The bond insurer was claiming JPMorgan misrepresented the quality of loans in securitized and therefore increased liabilities to Syncora. This is on top of $23 billion in fines and settlements last year, but thus far it's done little to slow down JPMorgan's stock.  American Express (NYSE:AXP) was up 2.8% to round out the top three stocks this week. Again, there was little significant news, but the slowly improving economy is helping revenue and earnings as consumers spend more money. The other advantage American Express has is that it more heavily targets affluent consumers than its rivals do. Those consumers are doing well in this economy, which will bode well for American Express long-term.Travis Hoium manages an account that owns shares of Apple and JPMorgan Chase.

146	"Menu Respect the bear, but never fear it. That’s a lesson every investor should take away from the panic of 2009, and it’s applicable everywhere — even now, as we sit around all-time highs.I remember the scene as if it was yesterday: It was Sept. 15, 2008, and investment banking giant Lehman Bros. had just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The S&P 500 fell more than 4.5% on the day, and as I left the office around 6pm after a busy trading day in Manhattan, the streets were quiet — much too quiet for New York City.On any other day, a sea of yellow cabs greeted me right outside my building in mid-town Manhattan, but not on Sept. 15. I found myself walking a few blocks north just to find a cab. It was eerie. With the financial epicenter of the globe being shaken to the core that day, the fear in the air was palpable.The market eventually would take the market through a shaky autumn and winter. In fact, it wouldn’t be until six months later, while headlines of doom and gloom were still flying faster than ever, that the market began to climb out of the abyss. On March 6, 2009, the S&P 500 finally capitulated to the ironic intraday level of 666, then on March 9, the market hit its closing low point at 676.53. A day later, stocks saw a big follow-through buying day, with the index rallying more than 6%.As it usually goes, neither the media nor the investing crowd took the March 10 bounce as anything more than a short-lived lift, and those smart enough to buy kept very quiet. But to me, it became clearer that considering the typical six-month lag in which the market works, coupled with the still-paralyzed investing public, at least a medium-term bottom was in place.I wasn’t smart/dumb enough to go all-in on stocks that day either, but because the psychological picture seemed to match up with what I saw on the charts, I knew better not to be caught short the market at the time.I was right.The general story in terms of bull and bear markets, particularly in the S&P 500, is that roughly every 13- to 17-year bull market is followed by a 10- to 15-year bear. (The Great Depression, depending on when you’re measuring from, stands out as an exception.)So, looking at the below chart of the S&P 500, which spans all the way back to 1927, this rhythm should somewhat stand out. After a flat tape the bear market from the mid-’60s through the early ’80s, the S&P 500 began its great bull run. Aside from the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, the bull market really kept running until the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s and early aughts popped. This then led to the “lost decade” and the easy monetary policy introduced by then-Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, during which stocks wildly gyrated and ultimately bottomed five years ago … in March 2009.
Click to EnlargeLooking at the past 20 or so years of trading in the S&P 500 a little more closely, what stands out on the below weekly chart is that the March 2009 capitulation marginally and classically broke below the index’s 2002 lows. This helped to wash out all those players who placed their stop-loss orders around this area, and paved the path for the steep and vicious rally we have witnessed since.The nail in the coffin for the bears came in spring 2013, when the S&P 500 broke to fresh all-time highs, leaving behind the market tops from 2000 and 2007.
Click to EnlargeThis has, in my opinion, given birth to a new secular bull market — the long 13- to 17-year type of cycle that I discussed above.However, with the cyclical bull market now five years of age, it is slowly but surely getting somewhat long in the tooth. While many sectors and industries/groups of stocks still look good on the long side, it is somewhat too early to clear the portfolio and or lean short this market. But if history is any guide, then at some point over the next three to nine months, a first cyclical bear market will throw investors a curveball.The thing to remember when all turns to panic (which it inevitably will) is that if we do indeed find ourselves in a new secular bull market, then the next cyclical bear should lead to a correction no bigger than roughly 30%.That would mean the major breakout that the S&P 500 staged in spring 2013 when it broke past long-term highs around 1,550 could easily get retested at some point.And if it does, just remember — the market always bounces back.Like what you see?

149	" While the current bull market is already longer than average, most market strategists expect stocks to have another good year in 2014. Stocks gained last week, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs, despite the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. The Dow Jones industrial average is less than 1% away from its all-time high.  But with little economic and corporate earnings news on tap this week, it may be tough for stocks to move much higher. So instead of our usual preview of the days ahead, we've decided to take a look back at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks of the past five years.  Related: Extreme greed is driving the market  Online travel companies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE) are two of the biggest winners of the bull market. Priceline shares have surged 1,646% and Expedia has soared 1,182% during the past five years.  Fast-growing consumer stocks have also done well, including Chipotle (CMG), Whole Foods (WFM) and Starbucks (SBUX). Wynn Resorts (WYNN), the casino company, and Netflix (NFLX) were big winners as well. Those stocks also gained at least 1,000%.  Big tech companies Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) had slightly less spectacular gains. They're in a group of stocks that have gained between 500% and 1,000% since March 2009. Ford (F) and Delta Airlines (DAL), two companies that were hit hard during the recession, are also among the companies that have far outpaced the S&P 500's gain of nearly 180%.  But there were a few stocks that have been left behind.  Avon Products (AVP), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) were big laggards. Best Buy (BBY), which was one of the best performers in 2013, is still up only 4% in the past five years.  And a few stocks actually missed the rally entirely. Shares of Staples (SPLS), which recently announced plans to close hundreds of stores, have fallen. First Solar (FSLR) shares are down 47% over the past five years, giving it the dubious distinction as the bull market's biggest loser.

				Originally published Monday, March 10, 2014 at  6:38 AM
					Happy 5th birthday, bull market.By STEVE ROTHWELLAP Markets WriterHappy 5th birthday, bull market.The current bull run is not the longest, or strongest in history, but it has survived a near default by the U.S. government, a debt crisis in Europe, and a war in Syria.Despite all the obstacles thrown in its way, this bull market is now the fourth-longest since 1945, according to S&P; Capital IQ. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 178 percent in the five years since it bottomed out on March 9, 2009.A bull market is a rise of 20 percent or more over a period of at least six months, following a decline of 20 percent or more. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.The current bull had a tough start to 2014. In January, the S&P; 500 index fell 3.6 percent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. Investors also worried about the strength of the U.S. economy. This month, the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where the region of Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to split away and join Russia. President Barack Obama and several other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.Despite the latest setbacks, stocks recovered and the S&P; 500 index closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.There have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest one stretched for almost a decade, between October 1990 and March 2000. The average bull market lasts 4-1/2 years, making the current one longer than average.The last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was taking hold. The S&P; 500 index dropped 57 percent from a record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2009, before bottoming out at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.Typically, bull markets end when investors get spooked by a recession, or anticipate one, and sell stocks. None of that is happening, which suggests this bull may have room to run yet. The economy appears to be strengthening rather than faltering. Corporate profits are at record levels. The job market is gradually improving and consumer confidence is rising.Inflation also remains low. When the Fed starts to worry about rising prices, it hikes interest rates to curb them. The higher rates can tip an economy into recession and prompt a sell-off in stocks.But with inflation under control, the Fed has stressed that it plans to keep its key short-term rate near zero for an extended period.Stock valuations remain in line with historical averages, says John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management. The price-earnings ratio for the next twelve months, which measures stock prices compared with forecast earnings, stands at 15.5, slightly below its 20-year average of 16.4.The stock market is ""not cheap, but it's not expensive either, so I think the market continues to move higher until further notice,"" Manley says.The bull market's gain is above the average advance of 141 percent for S&P; 500 bulls. But it is well short of the 417 percent jump from October 1990 to March 2000.Here is what's changed since the bull run began:HERE'S WHAT YOU COULD'VE WONSince starting its advance in March 2009, the S&P; 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent.  If you'd played it safe and invested in bonds, your total return would be 28 percent over the same period, according to the Barclays U.S. aggregate index, which tracks the broader debt market. If you'd played it even safer and invested in short-term government debt, certificates of deposit and other short-term debt securities, your return would be even smaller. Fidelity's money market fund, which makes such investments, returned 4.1 percent over the same period.BEST PERFORMERSThe best-performing stocks in the S&P; 500 index during the five year bull market are a drugmaker, a hotel company and a broadcaster. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is developing an experimental asthma drug, has climbed from $12.40 in March 2009 to $328.11 on Friday. That's a cumulative return of 2,546 percent, making it the best-performing stock since the start of the rally. Wyndham Worldwide, a hotel and lodging company that owns the Ramada and Days Inn, has soared from $3.10 to $75.70 as demand for hotels revives. The company has also raised its dividend. CBS has climbed from $3.09 to $67.40 as advertising revenue increased.THE LAGGARDSAmong stocks still in the S&P; 500 index since the start of the bull market, the worst performers are a solar panel maker, a mining company and a supplier of wholesale electric power.First Solar's shares are down from $108.36 to $56.11, a drop of 48 percent. The company has struggled to adapt to sharply lower panel prices. Newmont Mining has dropped from $37.79 to $24.60, hurt by falling gold and copper prices. Exelon, the nation's largest supplier of wholesale electric power, has dropped from $43.84 to $29.82 as electricity prices have fallen.THE ECONOMYWhen the stock market hit rock bottom, the economy was struggling, too. Jobs were harder to find five years ago and the U.S. had yet to emerge from the Great Recession. Economic growth has since strengthened, but the recovery remains slow.When the bull market began in March 2009 the unemployment rate was 8.7 percent. It rose to 10 percent in October that year, its highest level in 26 years. It has since fallen, and was 6.7 percent in February.COMPANY PROFITSS&P; 500 companies earned an average of $60.81 per share in 2009. Those earnings are projected to almost double to $118.16 by the end of this year, according to S&P; Capital IQ data. Corporate profits have climbed as companies have cut costs and demand has revived.NEW FACESTwitter shares now trade in the stock market, following its initial public offering in November. Facebook had a $16 billion IPO in May of 2012 and became a member of the S&P; 500 in December. Outside of social media, luxury clothing and accessories maker Michael Kors has been one of the more successful market debutants. Its IPO was in December 2011 and it joined the S&P; 500 in November.RETURN OF THE RICHLike the stock market, billionaires have also staged a comeback.In 2009, the number of billionaires in the world shrank by 30 percent to 793, with an aggregate wealth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes. The latest list of billionaires published last week shows that their ranks have more than doubled to 1,645, with a combined wealth of $6.4 trillion. The rebounding stock market has helped boost those numbers.Bill Gates is back on top this year as the world's richest person. The Microsoft founder and philanthropist reclaimed the spot from Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who topped the list for the previous four years. Gates' net worth is estimated at $76 billion, compared with $40 billion in 2009.CAR COMEBACKThe American auto industry has roared back. Crushed by unsustainable debt and sliding sales, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, and got government funding to help it recover. Since then, it has ditched its Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer and Saab lines. The automaker returned to the stock market in November 2010. Its stock closed at $37.69 on Friday, and is up 35 percent in the past year. Chrysler also filed for bankruptcy and has been acquired by Italian automaker Fiat. The only big U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy was Ford. Its stock has surged from $1.74 in March 2009 to $15.62 as of Thursday -- gain of 800 percent.

151	"Menu The current bull market turned five this weekend.  On Mar 9, 2009, the S&P 500 index touched a low of 676.13; it’s up 177% since then.The average length of bull markets since 1921 is 62 months, while average gains are 180%. On the other hand, median gain and length are just 115% and 50 months respectively.Last bull market ended days after it turned five in October 2007. But according to Capital IQ, bull markets have added another 26% gain if they survived for another year after their fifth anniversary.Most investors expect the market to go up this year and the path of least resistance for US equities is still up, even though this bull market has been the second strongest since World War II (chart from WSJ).But can this ageing bull maintain its momentum?

154	"  Europe's bull market hasn't bellowed quite as loudly in the past five years as the U.S.'s – but it has still had an impressive run.   The S&P 500 has been in a bull market for five years now, and historically bull markets last for five to six years at most. On March 9, 2009, the index closed at a positively satanic 666, five years on it had nearly tripled to 1874.   (Read more: Bull market may still have some sizzle)   The FTSEurofirst300, an index which ranks the 300 largest companies in Europe by market capitalization, has almost doubled over the same period, closing at 1326.7 at the end of last week. This happened despite the euro zone debt crisis and the bailout of weaker euro zone states like Greece and Ireland threatening the region's stability.   Greek equities are one of only two major asset classes (the other is the U.S. dollar) to fall over the period, and are down 30 percent – but this followed a huge credit crisis which some worried would force the country to leave the euro.   The bull market shows how faith in the will of the European Central Bank and European governments to keep the euro afloat has been restored. Confidence in European equities has returned.   The recent unrest in Ukraine, which some feared could be the kind of black swan event that derails markets, caused a minor dip in European stock markets which has since recovered.   A prolonged military conflict or sanctions may disrupt the region's gas supply from Russia. (Read more: 4 potential bull market killers)  Persistent slow growth in the region's biggest economies is potentially more damaging.   ""Earnings and economic growth have been (and we believe will continue to be) lackluster, and without growth or central bank liquidity, we see no generic reason to be bullish of European equities,"" Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer at RMG Wealth Management, warned. (Read more: Why bull market is like sex: Warren Buffett)  There is a risk of excess liquidity causing ""excess valuations in a narrow range of assets"" – or asset bubbles like the dotcom bubble of the early years of the twenty-first century, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists. So, roughly, if the flight out of emerging markets continues, then the price of assets like London real estate or peripheral euro zone bonds could reach unrealistic heights.   ""There are eerie similarities with the 1998-99 period,"" the BoAML strategists warned.   There are also concerns over European equities' exposure to emerging markets, which account for around 25 percent of European corporate revenues according to UBS research. Panic over the emerging markets has distilled slightly since last year's major sell-off, but is still in the backdrop of market movements.  - By CNBC's Catherine Boyle. Twitter: @cboylecnbc.

But it is well short of the 417 percent jump from October 1990 to March 2000.Here is what’s changed since the bull run began:HERE’S WHAT YOU COULD’VE WONSince starting its advance in March 2009, the S&P 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent. If you’d played it safe and invested in bonds, your total return would be 28 percent over the same period, according to the Barclays U.S. aggregate index, which tracks the broader debt market.

Fidelity’s money market fund, which makes such investments, returned 4.1 percent over the same period.BEST PERFORMERSThe best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 index during the five year bull market are a drugmaker, a hotel company and a broadcaster. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is developing an experimental asthma drug, has climbed from $12.40 in March 2009 to $328.11 on Friday. That’s a cumulative return of 2,546 percent, making it the best-performing stock since the start of the rally. Wyndham Worldwide, a hotel and lodging company that owns the Ramada and Days Inn, has soared from $3.10 to $75.70 as demand for hotels revives. The company has also raised its dividend. CBS has climbed from $3.09 to $67.40 as advertising revenue increased.THE LAGGARDSAmong stocks still in the S&P 500 index since the start of the bull market, the worst performers are a solar panel maker, a mining company and a supplier of wholesale electric power.First Solar’s shares are down from $108.36 to $56.11, a drop of 48 percent. The company has struggled to adapt to sharply lower panel prices. Newmont Mining has dropped from $37.79 to $24.60, hurt by falling gold and copper prices. Exelon, the nation’s largest supplier of wholesale electric power, has dropped from $43.84 to $29.82 as electricity prices have fallen.THE ECONOMYWhen the stock market hit rock bottom, the economy was struggling, too. Jobs were harder to find five years ago and the U.S. had yet to emerge from the Great Recession. Economic growth has since strengthened, but the recovery remains slow.When the bull market began in March 2009 the unemployment rate was 8.7 percent. It rose to 10 percent in October that year, its highest level in 26 years. It has since fallen, and was 6.7 percent in February.COMPANY PROFITSS&P 500 companies earned an average of $60.81 per share in 2009. Those earnings are projected to almost double to $118.16 by the end of this year, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Corporate profits have climbed as companies have cut costs and demand has revived.NEW FACESTwitter shares now trade in the stock market, following its initial public offering in November. Facebook had a $16 billion IPO in May of 2012 and became a member of the S&P 500 in December. Outside of social media, luxury clothing and accessories maker Michael Kors has been one of the more successful market debutants. Its IPO was in December 2011 and it joined the S&P 500 in November.RETURN OF THE RICHLike the stock market, billionaires have also staged a comeback.In 2009, the number of billionaires in the world shrank by 30 percent to 793, with an aggregate wealth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes. The latest list of billionaires published last week shows that their ranks have more than doubled to 1,645, with a combined wealth of $6.4 trillion. The rebounding stock market has helped boost those numbers.Bill Gates is back on top this year as the world’s richest person. The Microsoft founder and philanthropist reclaimed the spot from Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who topped the list for the previous four years. Gates’ net worth is estimated at $76 billion, compared with $40 billion in 2009.CAR COMEBACKThe American auto industry has roared back. Crushed by unsustainable debt and sliding sales, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, and got government funding to help it recover. Since then, it has ditched its Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer and Saab lines. The automaker returned to the stock market in November 2010. Its stock closed at $37.69 on Friday, and is up 35 percent in the past year. Chrysler also filed for bankruptcy and has been acquired by Italian automaker Fiat. The only big U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy was Ford. Its stock has surged from $1.74 in March 2009 to $15.62 as of Thursday — gain of 800 percent. Get breaking news delivered to your inbox as it develops.	Business
160	Happy birthday, bull market.If that sounds less than super-enthusiastic (what, no exclamation mark?), so be it. Yes, the S&P 500 index hit another record on Friday. But two facts make it hard to uncork the champagne and cut myself a slice of cake. The first is that a very large proportion of Americans haven’t benefited from this five-year-long rally. The second? I’m not confident that this bull market is going to last much longer than many of its predecessors. I certainly doubt whether we’re in the early stages of another 18-year bull market like that we witnessed from 1982 until 2000.I’d be more likely to celebrate this bull market if it had enriched a larger swath of the country. Data from Lipper and other providers who monitor flows into mutual funds show that until last year, ordinary investors stayed away in droves; they were more likely to keep yanking money out of stock mutual funds. So while the S&P 500 index is up 177.6 percent since the March 9, 2009 bottom (and 208.9 percent if you take dividends into consideration), anyone who delayed investing until last January lost out on most of those gains. Stocks have continued to soar since then – the S&P 500 is up 28.4 percent, and 31.7 percent if you include dividends – but that’s a fraction of what investors could have earned had they been willing and/or able to jump back in the market in 2009.Related: Confident Market Remains Watchful for Ukraine DisruptionOf course, ordinary investors had plenty of reasons to stay away. In the wake of the financial crisis, many Americans simply may not have felt financially solvent enough to take more risks with their money. Collectively, they had seen trillions wiped off their net worth as a result of the 40 percent stock market nosedive and the meltdown in real estate values.At the same time, it’s not easy to follow Warren Buffett’s advice and be greedy when others are fearful, especially when the pain of market losses is so fresh. Consumer confidence – a proxy of sorts for the willingness of investors to take risks – has recovered from the lows seen during the crisis and up until 2009, but it still languishes below its average during non-recessionary periods.Whatever the reason for the average investor’s reluctance to load up on stocks, it’s clear they haven’t benefitted as much from the market’s run. Yes, the net worth of U.S. households hit a new record of $80.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the Federal Reserve — about $12 trillion above where it stood in the spring of 2007, before the financial crisis. Yet the income gap has only widened in recent years: By the time the economic recovery (as distinct from the stock market recovery, which preceded it) finally got going, the top 1 percent of earners collected 93 percent of income gains.Let’s put to one side the vexing question of whether that’s fair or moral or sustainable. This data suggests that the vast majority of American households likely were less able to take advantage of the stock market’s recovery, even if they had been able to shake off the lingering psychological effects of the events of 2007 to 2009. Corporate profits may have rebounded, justifying the increase in price/earnings multiples and market valuations that we have witnessed – most dramatically during the course of 2013 – but personal earnings and profits didn’t.By the time individual investors shook off their aversion to stocks and climbed back on the bandwagon, it was already 2013. The lion’s share of the gains had already been captured. Of course, to the extent that those investors already had a toehold in the market in the form of 401(k) investments in mutual funds that owned stocks, they benefited to some extent, but odds are that their risk aversion was mirrored in their choice of 401(k) allocation as well.  The question now is whether the bull market will keep going so that those who arrived late to the party have a chance to capture some more gains going forward. It’s certainly possible, but market fundamentals are less rosy than they have been. The S&P 500 looks relatively pricey, and analysts are calling for relatively unimpressive first-quarter earnings growth. And economic growth is still clouded in uncertainty.The Federal Reserve is another source of uncertainty. How committed is the Fed to easing up on its bond market purchases and allowing interest rates to drift higher once more? It’s hard to argue that the incredible inflation in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet that accompanied the stock market rally is merely a coincidence; what remains unclear is the degree of willingness on the part of investors to focus on equity market fundamentals when the Fed removes its heavy hand from one side of the scales.   That doesn’t mean that we’re about to careen off the edge of a cliff – clearly, the bull market requires more than just a slow-motion taper on the part of Fed policymakers and pockets of bad news from emerging markets before it bids us sayonara.It’s worth remembering, however, that if you do feel like celebrating the bull market’s birthday, the safest way to do it may be by ordering up a big dessert after dinner rather than by allocating a lot more of your assets to U.S. stocks. Analysts widely expect that, even if the rally does continue, the path forward may be much bumpier than it has been. Certainly, it will be tough for the broad market to replicate its outstanding gains from last year.If you haven’t already rebalanced your portfolio in the wake of the 2013 gains, this is probably a great time to do so – and to scour the market for asset classes that are just as much in the doldrums today as U.S. stocks overall were back in the gloomy days of March 2009.Top Reads from The Fiscal Times:View the discussion thread.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index is up 178 percent in the five years since it bottomed out on March 9, 2009.A bull market is a rise of 20 percent or more over a period of at least six months, following a decline of 20 percent or more. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.The current bull had a tough start to 2014. In January, the S&P 500 index fell 3.6 percent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. Investors also worried about the strength of the U.S. economy. This month, the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where the region of Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to split away and join Russia. President Barack Obama and several other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.Despite the latest setbacks, stocks recovered and the S&P 500 index closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.There have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest one stretched for almost a decade, between October 1990 and March 2000. The average bull market lasts 4-1/2 years, making the current one longer than average.The last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was taking hold. The S&P 500 index dropped 57 percent from a record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2009, before bottoming out at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.Typically, bull markets end when investors get spooked by a recession, or anticipate one, and sell stocks. None of that is happening, which suggests this bull may have room to run yet. The economy appears to be strengthening rather than faltering. Corporate profits are at record levels. The job market is gradually improving and consumer confidence is rising.Inflation also remains low. When the Fed starts to worry about rising prices, it hikes interest rates to curb them. The higher rates can tip an economy into recession and prompt a sell-off in stocks.But with inflation under control, the Fed has stressed that it plans to keep its key short-term rate near zero for an extended period.Stock valuations remain in line with historical averages, says John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management. The price-earnings ratio for the next twelve months, which measures stock prices compared with forecast earnings, stands at 15.5, slightly below its 20-year average of 16.4.The stock market is “not cheap, but it’s not expensive either, so I think the market continues to move higher until further notice,” Manley says.The bull market’s gain is above the average advance of 141 percent for S&P 500 bulls. But it is well short of the 417 percent jump from October 1990 to March 2000.Here is what’s changed since the bull run began:HERE’S WHAT YOU COULD’VE WONSince starting its advance in March 2009, the S&P 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent. If you’d played it safe and invested in bonds, your total return would be 28 percent over the same period, according to the Barclays U.S. aggregate index, which tracks the broader debt market. If you’d played it even safer and invested in short-term government debt, certificates of deposit and other short-term debt securities, your return would be even smaller. Fidelity’s money market fund, which makes such investments, returned 4.1 percent over the same period.BEST PERFORMERSThe best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 index during the five year bull market are a drugmaker, a hotel company and a broadcaster. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is developing an experimental asthma drug, has climbed from $12.40 in March 2009 to $328.11 on Friday. That’s a cumulative return of 2,546 percent, making it the best-performing stock since the start of the rally. Wyndham Worldwide, a hotel and lodging company that owns the Ramada and Days Inn, has soared from $3.10 to $75.70 as demand for hotels revives. The company has also raised its dividend. CBS has climbed from $3.09 to $67.40 as advertising revenue increased.THE LAGGARDSAmong stocks still in the S&P 500 index since the start of the bull market, the worst performers are a solar panel maker, a mining company and a supplier of wholesale electric power.First Solar’s shares are down from $108.36 to $56.11, a drop of 48 percent. The company has struggled to adapt to sharply lower panel prices. Newmont Mining has dropped from $37.79 to $24.60, hurt by falling gold and copper prices. Exelon, the nation’s largest supplier of wholesale electric power, has dropped from $43.84 to $29.82 as electricity prices have fallen.THE ECONOMYWhen the stock market hit rock bottom, the economy was struggling, too. Jobs were harder to find five years ago and the U.S. had yet to emerge from the Great Recession. Economic growth has since strengthened, but the recovery remains slow.When the bull market began in March 2009 the unemployment rate was 8.7 percent. It rose to 10 percent in October that year, its highest level in 26 years. It has since fallen, and was 6.7 percent in February.COMPANY PROFITSS&P 500 companies earned an average of $60.81 per share in 2009. Those earnings are projected to almost double to $118.16 by the end of this year, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Corporate profits have climbed as companies have cut costs and demand has revived.NEW FACESTwitter shares now trade in the stock market, following its initial public offering in November. Facebook had a $16 billion IPO in May of 2012 and became a member of the S&P 500 in December. Outside of social media, luxury clothing and accessories maker Michael Kors has been one of the more successful market debutants. Its IPO was in December 2011 and it joined the S&P 500 in November.RETURN OF THE RICHLike the stock market, billionaires have also staged a comeback.In 2009, the number of billionaires in the world shrank by 30 percent to 793, with an aggregate wealth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes. The latest list of billionaires published last week shows that their ranks have more than doubled to 1,645, with a combined wealth of $6.4 trillion. The rebounding stock market has helped boost those numbers.Bill Gates is back on top this year as the world’s richest person. The Microsoft founder and philanthropist reclaimed the spot from Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who topped the list for the previous four years. Gates’ net worth is estimated at $76 billion, compared with $40 billion in 2009.CAR COMEBACKThe American auto industry has roared back. Crushed by unsustainable debt and sliding sales, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, and got government funding to help it recover. Since then, it has ditched its Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer and Saab lines. The automaker returned to the stock market in November 2010. Its stock closed at $37.69 on Friday, and is up 35 percent in the past year. Chrysler also filed for bankruptcy and has been acquired by Italian automaker Fiat. The only big U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy was Ford. Its stock has surged from $1.74 in March 2009 to $15.62 as of Thursday — gain of 800 percent. Copyright 2014 The Associated PressAdvertisementComments are closed.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement© 1998-2018 WWLP.com | Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. | All rights reserved.Powered by WordPress.com VIPAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement	Business

The bull market that began nearly five years ago now ranks as the fifth-best of the 13 major advances since 1930.From the market’s bottom on March 9, 2009, through March 5, 2014, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has returned an annualized 25.3%. In cumulative returns, an investment in the S&P; 500 has gained more than 200% when dividends are included.But some stocks can measure their percentage gains in the thousands. How could that be? Because in the late winter of 2009, the fear gripping the stock market was so intense that even shares of many big-name companies were selling for a few dollars, or sometimes just pennies. They were in effect priced for Armageddon. Investors who had the guts to jump in at that point wound up with massive gains, provided they held on.We wanted to find out which stocks have done best since the onset of the bull market and see what lessons could be drawn from them. So we asked Morningstar to cull its universe for the ten best performers, measured by total return, from March 9, 2009, through February 21, 2014. We limited the list to companies based in the U.S. and to those with market capitalizations today of at least $1 billion.Join us for the countdown to number one.(Returns are through February 21, but share prices and related ratios are as of March 5. Price-earnings ratios are based on estimated calendar 2014 earnings, unless otherwise indicated).

Market capitalization: $71 billionApart from the banks, few stock crashes in 2007 and 2008 were more dramatic than what befell casino titan Las Vegas Sands (LVS). As financial markets seized up and the global economy shuddered, the company's shares plummeted from $144 to a low of $1.28, a wipeout of 99%.Wall Street feared not only a sustained tourist slump in Las Vegas, where Las Vegas Sands owns the Venetian and Palazzo hotel/casinos, but also a sudden dearth of high-rollers in China's gambling center, Macau. There, the company owns the huge Venetian Macao, opened in 2007, and other resorts. What's more, Sheldon Adelson, the 80-year-old head of Las Vegas Sands, was pushing ahead in 2008 with a $5.7-billion casino resort in Singapore.But as usual with the feisty Adelson, luck was on his side — and with anyone who took a chance on the stock when it traded in penny-stock territory. The company made it through the financial crisis intact, then came roaring back as the global economy steadied. Revenue and earnings both hit records last year, at $13.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. The stock, at 23 times estimated 2014 earnings, isn’t cheap. But as Steven Wieczynski, an analyst at Stifel Financial writes, if the shares appear ""priced for perfection, we would counter that recent quarterly results have been just that, and then some.""Bottom line: Adelson takes big risks, but the payoffs have been enormous — though not yet for people who chased the stock at its 2007 peak.

Market capitalization: $2.2 billionAtlas Energy (ATLS) is a publicly traded master limited partnership that was dumped mercilessly in the commodity bust of 2008. By the time the stock market bottomed in March 2009, the firm's units could be had for 65 cents each. Pittsburgh-based Atlas owns controlling stakes in two other partnerships: Atlas Resource Partners, which explores for and produces oil and natural gas; and Atlas Pipeline Partners, a gas distributor. Those two businesses operate from Appalachia to New Mexico and have been players in the new U.S energy boom.Total revenue from the Atlas businesses reached $2.6 billion last year, up from $1.5 billion in 2012, thanks in part to acquisitions. Atlas Energy CEO Edward Cohen called 2013 a good year and says he expects 2014 to be ""even better."" As for cash distributions to investors — the primary reason investors buy energy partnerships — Atlas Energy says it expects to pay out between $1.95 and $2.45 per unit in 2014. That would mean a distribution yield of between 4.6% and 5.8% at the latest market price.Bottom line: An income-generating domestic energy play, but you should discuss MLPs with your tax adviser before investing.

Market capitalization: $1.5 billion American Axle (AXL) partly suffered guilt by association in the 2007-09 bear market as the car business tanked. But the threat to American Axle’s survival turned out to be very real: After its main customer and former parent, General Motors, filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2009, American Axle teetered on the brink — only to be rescued by GM, which provided a $110-million capital infusion in September 2009. American Axle returned to profitability in the third quarter of 2009, and its shares, which had sunk to a mere 29 cents at the bottom of the bear market, boomeranged back above $10 by early 2010. With the auto industry's continued recovery, the Detroit company's global sales of axles, transmission parts and other driveline components hit $3.2 billion last year, more than double 2009 levels. Operating income reached $240 million, the highest in nine years. But what Wall Street seems to like most is that American Axle is further weaning itself from its dependence on GM, which spun out the business in 1994. Sales to other companies accounted for 29% of American Axle's total last year, up from 25% in 2010. And the company continues to expand rapidly in key foreign markets, including Brazil, China and India.Bottom line: A cheap way to play the auto industry's global growth. But keep an eye on the company's debt level.
Courtesty CalAmp
Five-year total return: 7,885% (142% annualized) 
52-week price range: $9.26-$34.85   
Price-earnings ratio: 35* 
Market capitalization: $1.2 billion  A new wave of dot-com stocks has captivated Wall Street over the past year, yet few can match the recent performance of CalAmp (CAMP), a little-known, 33-year-old maker of telecom equipment. The Oxnard, Cal., company has been riding a surge in demand for wireless-telecom applications, such as improved package-delivery monitoring, ""M2M"" (machine-to-machine) systems that control the movement of trains, and emergency-response coordination by government units. Analysts see revenue hitting $280 million in the fiscal year that ends next February, up from $139 million two years ago. Earnings are expected to be $1.05 a share this year, up from 18 cents two years ago. Although the stock has responded in kind and then some, CalAmp's history may give investors pause. The shares also briefly spiked in the late 1990s and again at the tech zenith in the early 2000s, topping $40 both times — only to crash. But back then CalAmp was primarily a supplier of home satellite TV dishes. Now 80% of sales are in wireless equipment. FBR Capital Markets analyst Scott Thompson thinks CalAmp's wireless-growth prospects remain outstanding, with one caveat: If bigger players were to barrel into its markets, they could drive down product prices and potentially wreck CalAmp’s profitability, he says. With the stock at a rich 35 times estimated earnings, there's no margin for disappointment. Bottom line: Great little niche growth company, but high risk at these valuations. *Based on estimated earnings for the four quarters that end November 30

Market capitalization: $1.3 billion   When Perry Sook founded Nexstar Broadcasting (NXST) in 1996, his goal was to build a big portfolio of TV stations in midsize markets across the U.S. — places such as Salt Lake City; Scranton, Pa.; and Lubbock, Tex. He stuck to the plan, even though he got little love from Wall Street for much of the past 18 years. 
 
That changed beginning in 2012, when the market seemed to suddenly wake up to Sook's empire. The Irving, Tex., company’s shares have quintupled since mid 2012. Nexstar now owns, operates or provides programming to 108 TV stations reaching 56 markets and about 16% of all U.S. TV households. Revenue topped $500 million last year, and operating income was a record $103 million.  
 
One key to Nexstar's success has been the lucrative retransmission fees that cable companies pay to carry local TV stations. To complement his stations, Sook also has developed community news Web sites that stress local news. And while media empires often stress the value of their assets as an investor lure, Nexstar is offering cash back, too: The company in January announced a 25% boost in its quarterly dividend, to 15 cents a share. 
 
Bottom line: A great collection of valuable local broadcast outlets to buy on any pullback.

Market capitalization: $3.3 billion   Dana (DAN) was the proverbial baby thrown out with the bathwater in 2009. Many frightened investors figured that the Maumee, Ohio, auto-parts maker — newly restructured in 2007 — would quickly follow the car makers into insolvency.  It was a bad bet: Though Dana lost $431 million in 2009 as sales crumbled, it was profitable again in 2010. The stock recovered quickly from a low of 20 cents in 2009 to about $17 by year-end 2010. That accounted for most of the advance that propelled Dana to the number-five spot on our bull market winners' list.But since 2010, the stock is up a modest 26%. Dana's revenue fell to $6.8 billion in 2013, down 6% from the previous year. Weaker North American sales of big trucks and other heavy equipment trimmed demand for the axles, steering shafts and other driveline components that Dana supplies, and depreciating currencies hurt results in foreign markets, including South America. The company projects flat revenue this year and expects operating earnings to inch up to between $1.82 and $1.86 a share, compared with $1.77 last year. In short, there's not much excitement here in the near term. Bottom line: Needs a stronger global economy to lure investors. The modest 0.9% dividend yield isn’t enough to attract income investors.

52-week price range:$25.12-$48.97   
Price-earnings ratio: 18  
Market capitalization: $5.2 billion    The financial collapse of General Motors and Chrysler in 2009 caused investors to toss almost everything connected to the auto business onto the same junk heap. That included car rental giant Avis Budget Group (CAR), which saw its shares plummet to 38 cents in March 2009. But like many companies ravaged by the 2007-09 recession, Avis quickly hacked expenses to deal with shrinking revenue. By 2010, sales began to recover, the company was profitable again, and the stock was back above $10. It helped that Parsippany, N.J.-based Avis and other rental firms slashed the size of their fleets, creating car shortages that forced up rental rates. After pulling back in 2011, Avis shares have been red-hot again over the past two years as revenue has surged (reaching $8 billion last year) with rebounding leisure and business travel — and as the rental giants have continued to raise rates. That's a side effect of the massive industry consolidation over the past decade that left the Big Three rental firms — Enterprise, Hertz and Avis — with a stunning 95% of the market. Christopher Agnew, who covers Avis for MKM Partners, expects earnings of $2.77 a share this year, rising 35% to $3.73 in 2015, and calls Avis his ""highest conviction idea."" Bottom line: Still feels like a long-term bargain, assuming the now-concentrated industry maintains its pricing power.

52-week price range:$18.05-$25.29   
Price-earnings ratio: 17*   
Market capitalization: $2.0 billion   Many investors in early 2009 feared an economic collapse was imminent. And in the stock market, plenty of companies were priced accordingly: near zero. One was home-furnishings retailer Pier 1 Imports (PIR), which traded for a mere 15 cents at the market bottom. The Fort Worth, Tex., company already was in trouble heading into the Great Recession, as revenue began to slide in 2005 and losses mounted. Things got worse when housing collapsed. But Pier 1 CEO Alex Smith, who arrived in 2007, saw a way back from the brink: Slash payroll costs, close marginal stores, eliminate debt and refocus on finding one-of-a-kind merchandise. His strategy worked: By 2010, the company was profitable again. The stock rebounded to $5 by the end of 2009 and $10 by the end of 2010. Results have continued to improve: In the nine months that ended November 30, sales were up 9%, to $1.26 billion, from the same period a year earlier, and operating profit rose 7%, to $105.4 million. But like many retailers, Pier 1 posted disappointing 2013 holiday and post-holiday sales, which the 1,000-store chain blamed partly on wild weather late last year and early this year. As a result of the recent sales shortfall, the stock has declined 24% from its 52-week high. Analyst Joan Storms, of Wedbush Securities, advises buying the shares on this weakness. She thinks Pier 1 is capable of 15% annual earnings growth over the next few years, helped by an aggressive new online-shopping push. A plus is that the company remains nearly debt-free.

Market capitalization: $1.4 billion    Much of the huge gain by Keryx (KERX) has come in the past 15 months. The catalyst: optimism about the New York City firm's new drug, Zerenex, a treatment for side effects of chronic kidney disease.Japanese regulators approved Zerenex in January. The company, founded in 1998, is hoping for U.S. approval in June. Wall Street analysts project that the drug's market launch will push Keryx's revenue to $57 million this year, from $9 million in 2013. Keryx is expected to lose about 25 cents a share in 2014, but that would be about half of last year's loss. Some investors worry that Keryx hasn't announced a partnering deal with a major U.S. operator of dialysis centers. The fear is that the company may lack the resources to launch Zerenex alone and to go up against competing treatments already on the market. Keryx in January raised $90 million by issuing more stock, but that further diluted the stakes of existing shareholders. The analyst community, however, isn't flinching: Of the ten Wall Street analysts who follow the stock, every one has a ""buy"" rating on it. One of them is Oppenheimer & Co.’s Boris Peaker. He expects the company to attract a new round of positive attention when detailed Japanese studies of Zerenex are published, possibly soon.Bottom line: Too much uncertainty for all but the gutsiest speculators.

Market capitalization: $10.4 billion     Biotechnology has been one of the hottest sectors for the past two years, and no stock shows that better than Pharmacyclics (PCYC), which takes the crown as the biggest winner of the five-year-old bull market. A $1,000 investment in the Sunnyvale, Cal., company's shares at the market’s bottom in March 2009 is worth a stunning $177,557 today.The buzz began to build in 2011 for Pharmacyclics's drug Imbruvica, a new treatment for blood cancers such as leukemia. The company that year signed a deal with Johnson & Johnson to develop and market the drug. Last November, the two firms got Food and Drug Administration approval to start selling Imbruvica for a rare blood cancer. In February, the FDA approved the drug for a more common leukemia. Sales have already surged, and analysts on average expect Pharmacyclics's revenues to jump from $260 million in 2013 to $405 million this year and $778 million in 2015. They expect earnings at 8 cents a share this year, then see profits surging to 65 cents a share in 2015. The real excitement is about broader future uses for Imbruvica in cancer treatment. That's what is driving analysts' extremely bullish outlook for the 23-year-old firm. Robyn Karnauskas, of Deutsche Bank Securities, sees revenues of $4 billion and earnings of $15.66 a share by 2018 and sees the stock at $180 in 12 months. But as the past year has shown, a major challenge for long-term believers in Pharmacyclics is dealing with wild short-term trading in the stock. Bottom line: Likely to stay a hot stock, but suitable for big risk takers only. How patient can you be? Skip This Ad »View as One Page1100 13th Street, NW, Suite 750

You had to be very unlucky to lose money in stocks over the past five years. But it was possible.Despite a bull market that celebrated its fifth birthday on March 9, prices of some stocks are substantially lower today than they were at the bottom of the bear market. That's a pretty remarkable feat, given that so many stocks were priced for economic oblivion in early 2009.We asked Morningstar to cull its universe of stocks and give us the ""nightmare portfolio"" — the ten stocks that have lost the most over the past five years, even as broad market indexes have risen 200% or more. The stocks are ranked by largest negative total returns from March 9, 2009, through February 21, 2014. We limited the list to companies based in the U.S. and to those with market capitalizations today of at least $1 billion.Of course, as painful as these stocks' losses are to investors, the shares still are worth something. The true biggest-losers list would have been all of the stocks that went to zero in the financial crisis or its aftermath and no longer trade. Think Lehman Brothers.(Bull-market returns are through February 21, but share prices and related ratios are as of March 5. Price-earnings ratios are based on estimated 2014 calendar year earnings, unless otherwise indicated.)

But they parted ways with the rest of the stock market in 2011, when gold itself peaked, then fell into a deep bear market as many global investors began to shun the metal in favor of other assets.And whatever the price of gold does, mining shares tend to do on steroids: Their moves are often exaggerated relative to the metal. So Newmont Mining (NEM), one of the world's biggest gold producers, saw its stock collapse from $70 in 2011 to a low of just under $21 in early February of this year, a drop of 70%. Gold, by contrast, lost about half as much from its 2011 peak of about $1,900 an ounce to its low of $1,182 last December.This year, gold has gotten a bounce, to $1,336 an ounce. The miners, including Greenwood Village, Colo.-based Newmont, are following suit. For many investors, the miners are an easy decision: If you think gold is going higher, you buy; if you don't, you don't. But with Newmont there's an additional twist: The company raises or lowers its cash dividends depending on gold's price. In February, Newmont said it would slash its payout in the near term in light of gold's long decline. Understandable, maybe — but certainly not a welcome mat for investors.Bottom line: If you crave excitement, gold miners are for you. If you just like gold, then stick with the metal itself.

Market capitalization: $1.2 billionBetter times are harder times for FTI Consulting (FCN), and that partly explains how the stock managed a 33% decline in a raging bull market. The company offers an array of consulting services, advising companies that are restructuring, in bankruptcy or dealing with a potentially costly lawsuit, for example. That means business for FTI can be worse when it's better for clients.It's not a coincidence, then, that the post-crash year of 2009 was a great one for FTI, when it earned a record $2.63 a share on revenue of $1.4 billion. But since then, the West Palm Beach, Fla., company has yet to top those profits, even though revenue has crept higher. FTI disappointed Wall Street again last month by reporting a net loss for 2013 of 27 cents a share after one-time charges. The results, and FTI's forecast of weak first-quarter performance, drove the stock down 19% on February 20.Two problems seem evident from FTI's financial statements: First, although management has been using capital to buy back stock, annual interest costs of $51 million are sapping the bottom line. Second, the company's operating expenses have surged 43% since 2009, while revenue is up just 18%. Whatever the reasons, even at the stock's depressed level just one of the eight Wall Street analysts following FTI now recommends buying it. The others remain on hold.Bottom line: The consultant may be in need of a consultant.

Market capitalization: $1.1 billionEXCO (XCO), an energy producer, decided years ago to tie its future to natural gas rather than oil. And that's the root cause of the 40% slide in EXCO's stock over the past five years: Amid a glut of supply, U.S. natural gas prices have fallen by more than half since mid 2008.For EXCO, which explores for and produces gas in east and west Texas, north Louisiana and Appalachia, the dive in prices helped slashed revenue from $846 million in 2007 to $634 million in 2013. The Dallas company earned just $22 million last year, or 10 cents a share.Thanks to the frigid winter, gas prices have rebounded, creating hope that EXCO's hefty drilling investments (it shelled out $340 million for capital spending last year) will produce a bigger payday. The company has also been paring its heavy debt load. Still, with earnings expected at just 20 cents a share this year, there isn't much to recommend the stock — except maybe this: Two savvy investors, WL Ross & Co. and Oaktree Capital Group, are major shareholders, with stakes, at last report, of 19% and 17%, respectively.Bottom line: For gamblers, a high-risk bet on rising natural gas prices. Hope its biggest shareholders know something you don't.

Market capitalization: $1.4 billionAfter battling for years as a smaller player in the wireless-telecommunications market, Leap (LEAP) wound up being saved by the bell, or at least by a Baby Bell — namely AT&T;, one of the phone companies spun off by the original Ma Bell. Last July, Leap agreed to a buyout by AT&T; for $15 a share in cash, plus an expected bonus of about $2.50 per share from asset sales. The deal, worth $1.2 billion, awaits regulatory approval.But Leap's saga is a cautionary tale about the risk of betting on takeovers. The San Diego company, whose prepaid, no-contract wireless plans under the Cricket brand are popular with the young, had been rumored for years to be a buyout target. Those expectations helped drive the stock as high as $100 in 2007. Between that point and AT&T;'s bid, however, Leap was always left waiting at the altar, and its stock price moved relentlessly lower, bottoming at about $5 before AT&T; rode in.So even with the benefit of AT&T;'s bid, Leap ranks as one of the biggest losers of the bull market.Bottom line: Heard any good takeover-stock tips lately?

Market capitalization: $3.7 billionFor-profit education was supposed to be one of the hot growth industries of the 21st century. What investors didn't anticipate was Uncle Sam busting into the classroom and handing out an F — to the professor.Education companies, including Phoenix-based Apollo (APOL), have had a rough five years as federal and state authorities have zeroed in on alleged predatory practices. At worst, regulators say, for-profit educators have aggressively recruited students, persuaded them to borrow heavily to pay for school, then provided them lousy training that has left too many unable to find work after graduating (if they graduated). The government's crackdown ratcheted up in February, when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued ITT Educational Services for allegedly exploiting students and warned of more actions to come.For Apollo, which owns University of Phoenix, the pall cast by the government's crackdown has helped drag down enrollment. So revenue fell from a peak of $4.9 billion in 2010 to $3.7 billion last year, pulling earnings down as well. Although Apollo’s stock has lost nearly half its value during the bull market, it and most other education stocks have been recovering. Yet many analysts remain cautious. ""As the best-known name in the higher-education group, Apollo is likely to benefit when investor confidence in the sector rebounds from the bottom,"" says Trace Urdan, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. But with enrollment continuing to slide, ""it's still too early to declare an inflection"" in the outlook, Urdan says.Bottom line: For-profit education will survive, but just how profitable the industry will be is the big question mark. That argues against paying up for the stocks.*Based on estimated earnings for the four quarters that end November 30.

After the euphoria of the mid 2000s, many solar stocks remain far off their peak prices. Not surprisingly, the future didn't turn out to be as consistently bright for solar as the wildest bulls wanted to believe.A case in point is Tempe, Ariz.-based First Solar (FSLR), one of the biggest names in solar systems — and also among the worst-performing U.S. stocks of the past five years. It's not that demand for solar power has evaporated. But investors have learned the hard way that demand ebbs and flows, subject to global economic growth, fossil-fuel energy costs, rising competition (think China) and, not least, government energy policies.After tumbling again in 2011 and 2012, in part on disappointing European demand for solar equipment, solar stocks went on a tear in mid 2013. Then, in February, First Solar dropped a bombshell: Fourth-quarter sales and earnings, at $768 million and 89 cents a share, respectively, fell far short of Wall Street expectations. Why? The company blamed part of the shortfall on some projects running behind schedule, delaying recording of the revenue. But many investors now are waiting for First Solar's analyst meeting in mid March, when the company will give its annual forecast. At 18 times estimated 2014 earnings of $3.28 a share, First Solar stock is well below nosebleed territory. But it also isn't the bargain it was a year ago.Bottom line: The business is real. But so is the volatility.

Management of supermarket chain Supervalu (SVU) couldn't have had worse timing. In mid 2006, a bit more than a year before the start of the 2007-09 recession, the Eden Prairie, Minn., company loaded up on debt to buy 1,100 grocery stores from the Albertsons chain. Things have mostly gone downhill since: Supervalu stock, which peaked near $50 in 2007, edged below $2 in 2012 as losses ballooned. The stock has more than tripled from its 2012 low, but it is still down by half since the beginning of the bull market.Besides biting off more than it could handle with the Albertsons deal, Supervalu faced intensifying competition from the likes of Wal-Mart Stores. And the Great Recession made business rougher for nearly all retailers as consumers retrenched.Now, Supervalu is shrinking itself back to what it hopes will be a manageable size. It has shed hundreds of stores over the past year to end up with a core of wholesaling and retailing businesses (led by the Save-a-Lot chain), which are expected to have total annual sales of $17 billion. That's less than half what the company had at its peak. Wall Street analysts figure that Supervalu will earn 65 cents a share in the year that ends February 2015. At 11 times estimated earnings, the stock looks cheap — but this is a company that has a lot to prove to investors.Bottom line: If you want a growth stock, this probably isn't the place to shop. And no dividends,  either.*Based on estimated earnings for the four quarters that end November 30

Market capitalization: $2.5 billionThe decline of J.C. Penney (JCP) has been perhaps the most spectacular retail flameout of the past few years. Looking for new direction, the company's board of directors stunned Wall Street in June 2011 by giving the CEO job to Ron Johnson, creator of Apple's ultra-cool retail stores. Johnson's arrival stoked excitement in the retail industry, but it would end disastrously: His strategies — including eliminating markdowns — alienated many of Penney's core customers.With its stock continuing to crater, Penney axed Johnson in April 2013 and brought back the previous CEO, Myron Ullman. But sales continued to slide, taking the stock along. In the first nine months of the fiscal year that ended in January, Plano, Texas-based Penney lost $1.4 billion as sales fell 11%, to $8.1 billion. By February of this year, the shares were plumbing 50-year lows, at just under $5.But now Penney investors again have reason for hope. In a shock, Penney said on February 24 that sales at stores open at least one year rose 2% in the holiday quarter. Since the February 24 close, the stock has soared 59%. And CEO Ullman told investors that ""the most challenging and expensive parts of the turnaround [are] behind us."" Most Wall Street analysts aren't convinced: Just three out of 25 who cover the retailer advise buying its stock. So if you like contrarian bets, Penney qualifies.Bottom line: If it's between buying Penney stock and buying a Powerball ticket, you probably have better odds of winning with Penney.

Michigan's largest bank survived the financial crisis, but it made paupers of its shareholders in the process. Bleeding from mortgage losses, Flagstar (FBC) needed a $523 million capital infusion in January 2009 to stay afloat. About half of that came from the U.S. Treasury, the rest from private investors.The bank was forced to issue mountains of stock to the rescuers, severely diluting the ownership of the rest of its shareholders. Taking into account two ""reverse"" stock splits — designed to boost the market price of the stock without changing the value of shareholders' stakes — Flagstar's shares are down 66% from their value five years ago. Of course, it could have been worse: Shareholders of financial institutions that became insolvent, such as Lehman Brothers, lost everything.After bottoming in 2011, shares of the ""new"" Flagstar have been on the comeback trail as the Troy, Mich., bank has turned profitable again and has settled a host of mortgage-fraud claims with the government. Analysts expect Flagstar — which has shrunk to $9.4 billion in assets, from $14 billion in 2012 — to post earnings of $1.49 a share this year and $2.15 next year. Some investors are clearly willing to let the past go: The stock is up 80% from its 52-week low.
 
Bottom line: With the shares selling just slightly above the bank's theoretical net worth (assets minus liabilities), there's value here — if not much excitement.

Market capitalization: $1.2 billionAlpha Natural Resources (ANR) is a sad symbol of the downfall of King Coal. As the largest coal producer in Appalachia, Alpha had been slammed by the forces that have slashed demand for the fuel — in particular, cheap natural gas from the nation's fracking boom and mounting environmental concerns.The Bristol, Va., miner’s revenues plummeted from $7.1 billion in 2011 to $4.9 billion last year. Net losses over the past three years totaled $4.2 billion. A major restructuring in 2012 wasn't enough — Alpha announced more cost cutting last fall. As a result, the stock has lost two-thirds of its value since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the worst performer in our tally.Although many speculators have tried to call the bottom for Alpha shares over the past three years, every bounce in the stock has faded. Billionaire hedge-fund manager John Paulson, who had taken a flier on Alpha shares in late 2011, gave up in the fourth quarter of last year and sold his stake. Analyst Meredith Bandy, at BMO Capital Markets, expects Alpha's net loss to narrow to $1.20 a share in 2015 from a deficit of $2.07 per share this year. But she still rates the stock ""underperform"" — meaning stay away.Bottom line: An earnings recovery may be out there somewhere, but you'll strain your eyes looking.Skip This Ad »View as One Page1100 13th Street, NW, Suite 750

Yet, on March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) put in its crisis low of 676.53. Investors had given up on stocks in an environment in which they were being bombarded with seemingly catastrophic headlines on a daily basis.Seven days earlier, troubled insurer AIG had reported a $61.7 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 -- the largest loss in U.S. corporate history. Two days after that, General Motors disclosed to its shareholders in its annual report that ""there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern"" (the company was ultimately restructured under bankruptcy protection.) On March 9, the CBOE Volatility Index (VOLATILITYINDICES:^VIX), or VIX, which is sometimes referred to as Wall Street's ""fear index,"" closed at 49.68 -- it has not closed above that since then.What did we know then? Instead of imminent doom, however, investors might have anticipated that, barring outright economic collapse, there was a decent chance that stocks would perform reasonably well over the next five years (though the market's actual performance has exceeded what one could have hoped for).Why?Valuations. On March 9, the S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE, stood at just 11.9 -- cheaper than it had been at any point since 1986 (the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric popularized by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, compares stock prices to an average of inflation-adjusted earnings per share over a trailing-10-year period).And so it was that the fear and revulsion that brought low risky assets in general, and equities in particular, set the foundations for a stunning bull market:^GSPC data by YChartsFor the S&P 500 (blue line), which now boasts a 178% price return, a triple is almost in sight, if not immediately within reach. Note that the broad market, as represented by the Wilshire 5000 index (orange line) has done even better, thanks to the huge outperformance of small-capitalization stocks; the Russell 2000 (red line) has well more than tripled over the past five years. (Although the S&P 500 is the most widely used measure of the market's performance, it's technically a large-capitalization index.)Where do we go now? But where do those gains leave valuations today and what does that augur for returns over the next five years?As of Friday's close, the S&P 500 now sports a corpulent CAPE of 25.6, going from a 27% discount to its long-term historical average five years ago, to its current 55% premium. That puts the CAPE into the highest 10% of its values over its entire history going back to 1881.As hedge fund manager Cliff Asness observed in a November 2012 paper, historically, when the CAPE is within the top decile of its values, subsequent stock market returns are mediocre, with a 10-year real return that has averaged just 0.5% on an annualized basis (it's important to note, however, that the range of returns is very wide, varying from (6.3%) to +6.1%).Last month, another well-regarded value investor, James Montier of GMO, published a white paper describing two methods to forecast real returns over the next seven years based on the CAPE. The more optimistic estimate called for an annualized return of just +0.8%, while the more pessimistic produced a (3.2%) loss! Those ought to be sobering figures, particularly for individual investors who have only now begun to drink directly from the equity market punchbowl.With the prospect of such mediocre returns, should investors be selling their stocks instead of buying? My answer is ""no."" As my Foolish colleague Morgan Housel has highlighted, the CAPE isn't perfect (though I would argue it's the best metric we have) and even with a high starting CAPE value, the range of outcomes in terms of performance is very wide. As Cliff Asness points out:I would, if trading on a tactical outlook, give the Shiller P/E some small weight, particularly when it's above 30 or below 10. But I think this type of analysis is most useful not for a trading strategy but to set reasonable expectations. If you are a ""know-nothing"" investor (there is no shame in this -- it's the path almost every investor should adopt), the lesson is to temper one's expectations for future stock market returns -- the next five years are unlikely to mirror the past five and they could end up being very disappointing relative to stocks' historical average return (roughly 6.5% per annum, after inflation). Still, if you have an equity-appropriate time horizon, you can continue to put money into a low-cost index fund at regular intervals.2 values in a heated market If you have some skill, experience, and time -- and the inclination to pick individual stocks -- know that it's becoming increasingly difficult to ferret out names that trade at a discount to (or even at) their intrinsic value. However, there are still some values out there. Take the insurance sector, for example: MetLife (NYSE:MET), the No. 1 publicly traded life insurer in the U.S., is a wonderful franchise, yet it is valued at less than 9.5 times the next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate -- a significant discount to the overall market. Viewed from another angle, it does not take much in the way of returns on equity to justify the stock's 21% premium to its tangible book value.Another insurance-related name, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), looks reasonably priced. In his recently released annual letter to shareholders, CEO Warren Buffett wrote that stock repurchases at 120% of book value ""benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic value exceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount."" On Friday, Berkshire's shares closed at 136% of book value. My sense is that when Buffett refers to a ""meaningful amount,"" it's more than the difference by which 136 exceeds 120.When it comes to individual stocks or the broad market, valuation has predictive value with regard to future performance. Right now, the U.S. stock market doesn't look particularly cheap, and while that tells us nothing about the market's direction in the near term, it's an anchor on performance over the medium to long term. Just as investors who extrapolated bear market losses into the future five years ago were wrong, those who extrapolate similar gains to those achieved over the past five years could well be making the same mistake today.

					Many funds have more than doubled in the last five years, but that’s due in part to the calendar creeping closer to the anniversary of the March 9, 2009, bottom for the market.By STAN CHOEThe Associated Press Fabulous can have a flip side.It’s something investors should remember as mutual funds’ five-year return figures grow more eye-popping by the day. Many funds have more than doubled over that time, but that’s due in part to the calendar creeping closer to the five-year anniversary of the March 9, 2009, bottom for the market. That means the darkest days of the financial crisis are no longer counted in five-year returns, leaving only the recovery that sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 index to a record high.The anniversary is a key milestone because many potential investors scrutinize a fund’s five-year record when deciding whether to buy a fund. It’s important, though, to put those stellar performance numbers in context and to temper expectations.Market conditions are stacked against both stock and bond mutual funds having such strong returns over the next five years, analysts say. Plus, some of the funds with the best five-year returns led the pack because they focused on the riskiest investments. Many conservative managers, meanwhile, got left behind in the bull market.To see how big the numbers are, check the performance of the largest mutual fund by assets. Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index fund (VTSMX) has a five-year annualized return of 23.2 percent, according to Morningstar. At the end of 2012, its five-year annualized return was only 2.2 percent.Investors already have some experience with this effect. Something similar happened with funds’ three-year returns in early 2012.A fund’s three- and five-year returns are typically the numbers that average investors find most important, says David Mertens, a principal at Jensen Investment Management. Its mutual funds include Jensen Quality Growth (JENSX), which has Morningstar’s gold-medal analyst rating.Mertens would prefer that investors give greater weight to a fund’s returns over 10 years or even longer. But “people tend to buy what’s just happened,” he says. “People buy yesterday’s story.”Before you invest, here are some key considerations to put that story in perspective:
• A repeat performance is doubtful 
Stocks are unlikely to rise as dramatically, in part because they don’t look as cheap as they did in 2009. One popular way to measure whether a stock is expensive is to divide the price of a stock by its earnings per share over the last 12 months. Robert Shiller, a professor at Yale University and one of the winners of the Nobel Prize in economics last year, takes it a step further. He thinks it’s misleading to look at just one year because earnings can surge or drop in an economic cycle. To smooth out distortions, he looks at the S&P; 500’s level versus its average earnings per share over the prior 10 years, adjusting for inflation.By that measure, the S&P; 500 in March 2009 was at its cheapest level in 23 years. Now, it’s nearly twice that level and back above its average since World War II. That suggests future gains for stocks won’t come from a further rise in price-earnings ratios as much as from growth in earnings.This year, analysts forecast earnings per share for S&P; 500 companies to rise 7.9 percent.For bond funds, strategists are more pessimistic given expectations that interest rates will rise from their relatively low levels. Five years ago, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 3 percent and on its way down. Falling interest rates help bond mutual funds because they push up prices for existing bonds.Now, the 10-year Treasury’s yield is below 2.7 percent, but strategists say it’s on its way up. Many bond mutual funds in 2013 had their first down year in more than a decade amid rising interest rates.
• The last five years have rewarded risk 
The top-performing stock fund over the last five years has been the Direxion Monthly NASDAQ-100 Bull 2x fund (DXQLX), which has a 60.7 percent annualized return. But it’s not what most people would consider a core investment. The fund is meant more for short-term traders than long-term investors.It uses leverage in its attempt to double the monthly results of the Nasdaq 100 index, before fees and expenses. While that supercharges gains when the market is strong, it also accelerates losses during downturns. The fund lost 82.8 percent in 2008.The reward for risk taking can also be seen among target-date mutual funds, which many savers depend on for their retirement accounts. These funds own mostly stocks when an investor’s retirement date is far off and automatically migrate toward bonds as the date nears. But some have less in stocks than others, even if they’re targeted at the same year of retirement.The Wells Fargo Advantage Dow Jones Target 2025 fund, for example, is more conservative. That’s why it’s in the bottom 3 percent of its peer group for five-year returns. But in 2008, its greater emphasis on bonds helped to cushion the stock market’s losses, and it was in the category’s top 7 percent.The good news is that investors don’t have to look back too far to see how a fund manager performed in a variety of markets, says David Lafferty, chief market strategist for Natixis Global Asset Management. It has $867.2 billion in assets under management.Since the late ’90s, stocks have undergone three bull markets (the dot-com boom, the housing bubble and the most recent recovery for stocks) and two bear markets (the dot-com bust and the financial crisis).

167	"  Odds are against the stock market's aging bull making it through a sixth year, but this is no ordinary bull market.   Analysts expect stocks to continue running higher but at a slower pace than the 30 percent gain of last year.    It was five years ago this week that the S&P 500 plunged to an intraday low of 666, forcing capitulation of even the steadiest hands in a market panicking on fears that the financial sector was so ill it couldn't be cured.   Blue chips, like American Express  and General Electric, were trading in the single digits. Since then, the S&P 500 has rebounded 177 percent to new highs, and the wounded financial sector is up more than 250 percent but still 60 percent off its 2007 high, according to S&P Capital IQ.   Fewer than a third of bull markets make it through a sixth year, but those that do have averaged gains of 26 percent in that year, says S&P Capital IQ. Monday marks the start of year six, and Wall Street strategists—nearly all expecting solid gains this year—say the economy will now have to prove that it is strong enough to keep corporate profits rising, as the Fed continues to pull back from its easy money policies.   ""I think in a sense we're back to a more normal market environment,""  said Sam Stovall, chief strategist of S&P Capital IQ. Stovall, like others, says the market is particularly stretched since it has not had a major correction in months. ""I think we're bumping up against fair value for stocks, so unless we make some dramatic change to our economic and earnings growth expectations then I think we either have to correct in time or in price."" But he still targets the S&P reaching 1,940 by year-end.  (Read more: All clear on jobs front? Hmmm, maybe not so much)   While many analysts drew parallels during the financial crisis to the Great Depression and the market crash that preceded it, Stovall said the policy reactions were very different this time. ""What was different was the way the Fed responded to the financial crisis. What made me think this is not the 1930s/1940s is we got back to break even after five years. It took 25 years to get back to break even after the crash of 1929, and I think the bulk of that delay was the missteps of both the Fed and the Treasury.""    With the Fed stepping back  from its bond-buying program, stocks will have to navigate an environment of rising rates as long as economic growth improves as expected. Rates moved higher after Friday's jobs report reinforced the view that a recent batch of weak data is likely temporary and the result of bad winter weather. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.81 percent, a six-week high. There were 175,000 nonfarm payrolls added in February, the best pace since last year.  (Read more: Stronger jobs could signal higher rates)   ""We are paying most attention to the growth numbers. Typically over the last several years, the monetary policy picture has been a huge driver, and getting that right was a big part of being correct about making money in the market,"" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust. ""We think that's fading to the back burner. The market's got QE fatigue. What the market really needs to see to continue the bull market is organic growth because the Fed said: 'we want to get out of this game.' ""   The market will also have to deal with more volatility, already impacting stocks this year since the Fed began pulling back from its quantitative easing program. Analysts, however, do not expect rates to rise so rapidly stocks will be jarred, and that's partly because the Fed has vowed to hold short-term rates lower for longer.  (Watch: Cashin says: Goldilocks jobs number)    ""Our base case is we will see better performance of the market in the second half of the year because we do think better growth will come through. The stock market can handle higher rates as long as the economy is growing but if rates are rising because inflation is the cause, the market doesn't like that,"" McDonald said. ""The increases we have had in rates are because of better growth and a view the Fed is beginning to normalize policy, and we think that's good for the stock market.""   Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said the market should be able to handle the Fed's move away from QE. He expects the S&P to reach 1,975 to 2,025 this year. ""I think the economy has been healing, and I think there's a lot of room for growth, and if you look at things like consumer debt ratios, debt service to income is very low—the lowest level in 30 years. The last two times we were this low were the early stages of expansion in the early 1980s and early 1990s,"" he said. Thayer said the debt service to disposable income is down to 9.92 percent from 13.18 before the financial crisis and compared to 10.37 in the early 1990s.   (Read more: Americans borrow more but hit the plastic less)   ""The bottom line is we still have the capacity to grow further if there aren't any major disruptions in the global economy. We think even though the market has done well in five years, there's a lot of room for further gains. It may not be smooth sailing every year, but we see more gains.""   Thayer said he sees that the biggest risks for U.S. stocks are likely to come from overseas, and he would put money first into U.S. stocks, then Japan and Europe, and lastly emerging markets.       McDonald said the situation with Ukraine should not impact stocks even if Crimea becomes part of Russia, but further aggression could change that view.   ""What would cause the bull market to end? There's two possibilities. One is the economy runs out of gas and investors say: 'There's no more monetary support. We're going to take money off the table,' "" he said. ""The second is the economy gets so strong that the Fed has to raise interest rates and you have a typical end of the bull market."" But McDonald said he is still constructive on stocks though he said the idea that the economy gets weaker is the scenario he sees as more likely at some point in the next couple of years.   ""We have gone over 600 days without a 10 percent correction. Typically on average, you have a 10 percent correction every 161 days. 1,250 days without a 20 percent correction. We typically have one every 635 days. The market is extended,"" said McDonald. ""Those periods tend to be more extended during bull cycles. It is not unusual to have longer cycles when the market is going up, and that 's what we experienced, but it's telling you this rally is long in the tooth.""  The S&P 500 closed up just about 1 percent this past week, at 1,878. Events in Ukraine first sent stocks spiraling lower Monday before swinging to record highs later in the week. The Dow was up 0.8 percent for the week, at 16,452, and the Nasdaq was up 0.6 percent at 4,336. The Dow is still more than 100 points away from its all-time high.   In the coming week, traders said Treasurys could continue to trade lower, with yields rising, ahead of $64 billion in auctions for three- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds Tuesday through Thursday.   Key data in the week ahead includes retail sales on Thursday.   Perhaps one of the biggest events of the week will be the confirmation hearing for Stanley Fischer as Fed vice chair. The hearing also includes the renomination of Jerome Powell as Fed governor, and the nomination of Lael Brainard as a member of the board.

The stock market crash this week  that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S.  stock markets.Subprime financial crisis-related  events would ultimately become responsible for five out  of the top ten biggest single-day Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market crashes,  including the top two spots.  After the Dow Jones hit an (at  the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more  than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 – a little under 18 months later.U.S. markets hit their lowest  point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point  is this Sunday.Since that day, U.S. markets have  skyrocketed. The S&P  500 Index is up  174.7% (1,193.85 points), the Dow Jones  Industrial Average has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and  the Nasdaq is up  235% (3,040.5).Note: Turn market  volatility into profits by learning to trade the market's most powerful index. Here's how…In fact, as of this week, the  bull market – defined as a period in which the S&P 500 gains 20% or more –  ranks as the sixth longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group  research.However, the longer this rally  lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least  an official stock market correction – defined as a decline of 10% or more.""I am very concerned about a  correction right now,"" Money Morning Chief Financial Strategist Keith  Fitz-Gerald said on Friday. ""The past few weeks have seen higher prices and  lower volume. This is like climbing a mountain into thin air – every step  higher gets harder. Sooner or later, the markets are going to have to take a breather  and turn around.""Here are the three signs that have investors worried we're due for a  stock market crash or correction soon… if (location.search.indexOf(""continueReading=1"") >= 0) {  jQuery(window).load(function() {    jQuery(window).scrollTop(jQuery(""#continueReading"").offset().top - 35);  });}Join the conversation.

FB stock moved much higher on higher earnings and growth in mobile advertising revenue but on lower volume. I noticed it at the time, but until now, nobody else seemed ready to make a comment about this development. Most pundits wait until there already is a consensus with either their peers or the public before stating a (existing) trend in motion. As the saying goes: "" Its way better to be wrong but in agreement with the majority (crowd) than right but alone"". This tendency alone goes a long way in explaining market behavior. Therefore, we tend to experience waves of of momentum up or down and consequent volatility.Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.Your email address will not be published.

170	"Published: Mar 7, 2014 2:12 p.m. ETBySAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — U.S. stocks enter their sixth year of a bull market this Monday, joining a rare group of multi-year stock surges that can support early retirements, pay off college debt, and make pension funds whole. Or not. The fifth year of the last bull market ended spectacularly and painfully for investors in October 2007, leaving many so scarred they avoided stocks years into this latest rebound. The good news: The few cycles that make it past their fifth birthday keep motoring along, churning out as much as a decade of gains. Momentum is your friend: On average, the sixth year has produced 26% growth. The bad: There's plenty that’s different this time around, starting with the Federal Reserve’s full-throttle bond buys to flatten yields. The S&P 500 already produced an eye-popping 30% gain last year. The economy needs to get back its mojo — the 3% growth rate that’s been elusive since 2005.“What ended nearly every [bull market] was a recession, so we need continued economic growth,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.The almost five-year-old bull market started on March 10, 2009, when the S&P 500 Index

                                         both rebounded 6% in one day off their respective multi-year lows reached March 9. At the low, the S&P 500 closed at a bottom of 676.53, a drop of nearly 57% from its October 2007 highs. The Dow closed at 6,547.05. Since then, the S&P 500 has climbed 177% and the Dow has gained 151%.Concern that days are numbered for the current bull market are not unfounded. A minority of bull markets since 1945 have made it to their sixth birthday.Including the current bull market, there have been 12 since the end of World War II. Of those, only half of them made it to a fifth birthday, according to Sam Stovall, chief equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, in a recent note.After that, the list gets halved again for those making it to a sixth birthday. Those bull markets include the 7-year bull market that ended in August 1956, the 6-year bull market that ended in November 1980, and the nearly 10-year-old bull market that ended in March 2000. Those go-go days of the 1990s bull market, which ended in the Internet bust, fattened nest eggs with an S&P 500 gain of over 400%.The history is tantalizing, particularly for investors still repairing the damage from the last bear market and a concurrent housing market collapse.Here’s what this bull market needs to do to make it to its sixth birthday, says Stovall:That last part can be troubling given concerns that stock prices have grown faster than their supporting earnings. Stovall said that while the trailing 12-month P/E is above average since 1947, it’s actually below the average when the consumer price index has been in the 1.5% to 2.5% range.For the economy, a 3% growth rate for the U.S. isn’t a slam dunk. The U.S. economy hasn’t grown 3% or more in nine years. A recent revision of fourth-quarter GDP figures showed the economy growing at 2.4%, down from a previous figure of 3.2%.

                                         note is in the 2.7% range — in contrast to 4.65% at the end of the last bull market in October 2007. Back in March 2009, P/E ratios for stocks in the S&P 500 had fallen below 11x. Now, they’re back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007. That means that earnings growth has become even more crucial to cool off those multiples.Bull markets tend to tap out when trailing 12-month P/E ratios get into 17x to 18x territory, Kleintop said. Earnings can support valuations for now but are not enough to support another big market surge, Kleintop said.“We know what expensive looks like, so we’re pretty shackled to earnings growth,” Kleintop said.That view is pretty consistent with what many strategists were calling for in December: After a big jump in 2013, stocks will likely grow in the mid-to-high single digits in 2014. Another indication the current bull market will see a sixth birthday is that market breadth is relatively stable, meaning no one sector or handful of stocks is fueling the market.The biggest drivers of the current bull market have been consumer discretionary stocks, followed up by financials, industrials, and tech stocks. That’s opposed to the bull market that ended in 2000, where tech stocks were far and away the sole market driver, according to Kleintop. In the current bull market, growth is being driven by cyclical stocks, which are closely linked to the economy. While they may be expensive, consumer discretionary stocks have been more productive than they have ever been, and are therefore deserving of a higher multiple, Kleintop said.Notable consumer discretionary stocks that have jumped in price by more than 1000% over the past five years include Wyndham Worldwide Corp.

In addition, consumer discretionary stocks also saw an above-average gain in revenue at 4.8% in 2013.Outside of GDP growth in the 3% area, the key to economic growth in 2014 will have to come from capital expenditure spending and hiring from corporations, which are sitting on record cash piles. That’s crucial because capital investment accounted for no GDP growth in 2013, according to Kleintop.Capital expenditure spending may improve in 2014, according to a recent note by Russ Koesterich, BlackRock global chief investment strategist.Given the lackluster recovery, Koesterich said companies are still conservative given the overindulgences and excess capacity of the past two bull markets. Also, consumer confidence is just beginning to recover with current levels still under the long-term average. As the consumer strength returns to speed, certain industries are likely to benefit.“In terms of specific beneficiaries, we believe spending is likely to be led by financial, telecom and service industries,” Koesterich noted. “This suggests that technology companies may be beneficiaries if capital spending begins to accelerate.” More on the bull market’s 5th anniversary:  5 ways to protect your profits as the bull market turns five  Why you’ll be stuck with single-digit stock returns for years  5 years after crisis, Citi is alone in trading below book value

172	6 Min Read(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud. Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers. The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit. The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse. “This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.” Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency. An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing. “We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper. Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding. The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles. Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7. Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted. Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners. The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company. Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States. It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations. Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French. When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking. He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing. Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight. The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup. The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary. The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.

175	"Mt. Gox is well-known for creating one of the world's first Bitcoin trading posts. Unfortunately, in the company's most recent attempt to save its legacy, the virtual company has had to file for bankruptcy to protect its remaining assets, while trying to expand internationally.Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Chapter 15 bankruptcy is special because it often deals with cases and scenarios that are related to other countries as well. The goal of this proceeding is to combine efforts to come to a mutual agreement.The Japanese company first filed for bankruptcy protection on February 28, back in Tokyo, Japan. Filing in the U.S. enables the virtual currency company to use the U.S. court systems which would help solve the company's case faster and much more efficiently.Related: What Companies Accept Bitcoin?CEO Mark Karpeles is blaming cyber attacks and theft for the loss of monetary gain and has even stated that it can go bankrupt at any point in time. ""For several weeks MtGox customers have been affected by bitcoin withdrawal issues that compounded on themselves. Publicly, MtGox declared that 'transaction malleability' caused the system to be subject to theft, and that something needed to be done by the core devs to fix it.""Karpeles continued, ""Gox's own workaround solution was criticized, and eventually a fix was provided by Blockchain.info. The truth, it turns out, is that the damage had already been done. At this point 744,408 BTC are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years.""The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet. The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company.""Even though all signs point to a bankrupt company, the Bitcoin industry has flourished in general and some signs have even pointed to new ATMs being created to function with Bitcoin currency.Posted-In: Bitcoin Mt.

Gox CEO Mark Karpeles,  center, is escorted as he leaves the Tokyo District Court on Feb. 28. Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in the United States on Monday, following a similar filing in Japan. (Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg)Furious about your Mt. Gox losses? You’ll have to cool your heels.U.S. legal actions against Mt. Gox — notably a lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court that sought class-action status — are on temporary hold after the bitcoin exchange submitted a bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday.Mt. Gox sought Chapter 15 protection, designed for cases where the parties are based in multiple countries. The Tokyo company, once the world’s largest bitcoin trading post, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Feb. 28.At the time it said  750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 Mt. Gox bitcoins were missing, meaning a cool $450 million had gone up in smoke.The U.S. bankruptcy eventually could benefit stranded investors, giving the U.S. a structure to work with other countries to track down any remaining assets.Over the weekend, furious bitcoin users hacked the website of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, posting data that appears to show that the exchange still holds customer investments in the millions of dollars.“It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities’ wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” an anonymous hacker wrote.So on the downside, Mt. Gox has imploded. On the upside, it’s vaulted into the echelons of companies whose names became common verbs. Of course, being synonymous with total flakiness is not something most CEOs aspire to.Believe it or not, getting “goxed” first showed up in Urban Dictionary almost three years ago after a spate of Mt. Gox closures and trading delays, but it’s caught fire in the past couple of weeks.Carolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. 	Business
177	"Hackers this weekend targeted the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, CEO of the bankrupt Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, posting information online that they claim proves Karpeles is actually hoarding bitcoins he claims were stolen.The hackers charge that some of the nearly half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency lost in recent cyberattacks is actually still in the French CEO's possession.""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,"" the unnamed group wrote, according to Forbes, a reference to the downtime and other glitches that have plagued Mt. Gox.The hackers initially posted to Karpeles's website a 716MB file of stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers; it included a spreadsheet of more than a million trades, the company's balance in 18 currencies (including bitcoin), administrative access to Gox parent company Tibanne Limited, and a screenshot of the hackers' access, as well as a list of Karpeles's home addresses and personal resume.An abridged version, which features Mt. Gox's balances, was later posted online, with a link to the entire set of data.""This release would have been sooner, but in the spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data,"" the hackers wrote on Pastebin, advising readers to ""repost and share this info before it's gone.""Karpeles's website is currently offline, and the original Reddit post has since been deleted.Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan late last month, saying it lost 750,000 bitcoins, or about $480 million7 percent of the estimated global total of bitcoins. An attack on the company's computer systems also cost Gox about 100,000 of its own units.The filing came days after the exchange mysteriously went offline, halting trades of the cryptocurrency.Last month, meanwhile, bitcoins valued at approximately $2.7 million went missing from Silk Road 2, allegedly due to a hack. Silk Road 2 is the reincarnation of the original Silk Road, an online black market for all things criminal that was shut down by the feds last year. The new site emerged in November and is only accessible to those who have an invite and sign in using the Tor anonymizing service.Bitcoin has been a popular topic of late. Last week, Newsweek said it had uncovered the creator of bitcoin, a 64-year-old California man named Satoshi Nakamoto. But has denied any involvement.For more, see How Thieves Steal Your Bitcoins, as well as the Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies slideshow above.Also check out PCMag Live in the video below, which discusses Karpeles and the ""stolen"" bitcoins.Google SDK for Android Wearables Coming SoonSony, Panasonic Tip 300GB - 1TB Archival Storage Disc

180	Reuters Staff7 Min Read* Objectors allege Mt. Gox’s U.S. bankruptcy part of a fraud * Opponents said Karpeles recently moved millions of dollars of bitcoins * Case may revive criticisms of U.S. shell corporations By Tom Hals March 10 (Reuters) - Mt.

The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

183	"The Japanese-based bitcoin exchange has filed bankruptcy papers in the US following a similar move in Japan last month.On Sunday, Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US having filed a similar application in Japan on 28 February. The particular chapter of bankruptcy protection sought deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.The move is just the latest move in the unfolding story of what was once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, handling up to 80% of all trades at one point in 2013.On 28 February the exchange's CEO Mark Karpeles filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo claiming that 850,000 bitcoins (at the time worth around £240 million) had been stolen from the exchange, 100,000 which belonged to the company and 750,000 belonging to the customers.Chapter 15 protection in the US was introduced back in 1997 and is almost entirely based on the UN Model Law which aims to modernise and harmonise cross-border insolvencies around the world.Some reliefIf granted it would provide some relief for Mt. Gox, including the granting of an ""automatic stay"" preventing creditors seizing its US assets.A company files for bankruptcy protection if it believes it can recover financially, given time and some amount of restructuring and reorganisation - this could include a change of management, business model or the selling of a highly-value assets such as buildings (which could be leased back from the buyer) or vehicles.When a company files for bankruptcy outright, it has accepted that it is no longer able to repay its creditors and any steps for recovery are impossible.The latest move in Mt. Gox's story comes after hackers claim to have stolen transaction logs from the exchange which they published on Karpeles' personal blog over the weekend. The hackers claim the under-fire CEO was lying about the amount of bitcoins the exchange had leading to many users of Mt. Gox to claim Karpeles had stolen their bitcoins."	Business

Find out more.XForbes reports that anonymous hackers took over community website Reddit, as well as the personal blog of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles, on Sunday to allege that Karpeles had actually retained some of the Bitcoins that the company said had been stolen from its users.The blog post has since been removed, although the message can be viewed on Pastebin.""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.""The 716MB file dumps appears to include personal data – including Karpeles' home address and resume, as well as a purported screenshot of MtGox's Bitcoin balance.Hackers say that this ledger shows that the trading exchange still has a current balance of 951,116 BTC which would – if true – mean that customer Bitcoins have not been lost, but rather that fraud has been committed. MtGox filed for Japanese bankruptcy on 28 February and claimed at the time that it had lost around 850,000 Bitcoins, including 100,000 of its own, as well as approximately £16.41 million (US$ 27.3 million) in customer deposits.Forbes writer Andy Greenberg points out that it is possible that this could simply be a case of accounting mismatches, with the exchange counting Bitcoins as being safe even when they had already been stolen. However, it is worth noting that since MtGox has filed for bankruptcy protection, the public ledger of Bitcoin transactions – the Bitcoin blockchain (which tracks the movement of currency, while ensuring that the users are anonymous) – has not registered any movement of the “stolen” virtual coins.“I couldn't verify that Sunday's database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how MtGox's accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins–that it was counting Bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves,” said Greenberg.In related news, MtGox recently issued a press release to say that phishing campaigns have been making the rounds. Hackers have used MtGox's identity and been asking for the name, address, username, password and bank account numbers of those who have lost virtual currency.Karpeles and other MtGox officials couldn't be reached for comment on this story.

185	Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox on Sunday filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S., more than a week after it filed for bankruptcy in Japan and disclosed that it had lost about 750,000 of its customers\’ bitcoins.Chapter 15 is a chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code that facilitates insolvency cases involving parties in more than one country. Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 in Dallas and is being represented by Baker & McKenzie, which is also the law firm representing Mt. Gox its civil rehabilitation proceeding in Japan.\”There may be Mt. Gox assets and liabilities in the U.S. — clearly there is at least one lawsuit that we’re already aware of — and to the extent bitcoins with a relationship to Mt. Gox are accessible in the U.S., Mt. Gox wants to invoke the bankruptcy automatic stay,\” said Ira Herman, a partner at Thompson & Knight in New York.\”The automatic stay will serve to halt attempts including litigation to recover against Mt. Gox or to seize Mt. Gox\’s assets,\” said Herman, adding that the stay doesn\’t apply until a recognition order is entered.Mt. Gox\’s Chapter 15 filing showed it is seeking relief from two parties in the U.S. with pending litigation: CoinLab Inc. and Gregory Greene, a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit who alleges he lost $25,000 worth of bitcoin. The class-action lawsuit was filed against Mt. Gox and Chief Executive Mark Karpeles on Feb. 28 in Illinois on behalf of all people in the U.S. who held bitcoins in the exchange by the law firm Edelson PC. The lawsuit seeks the return of the customers\’ funds and damages against Mt. Gox and Karpeles.There is an emergency hearing scheduled for Monday in Texas on Mt. Gox\’s filing, according to Christopher Dore, a partner at Edelson who is working on the case. He refused to comment until after the hearing.Mt. Gox\’s application for a Japanese civil rehabilitation proceeding on Feb. 28 disclosed that the exchange\’s liabilities exceed its assets, and some of the liabilities may have been linked to missing bitcoins. The Japanese proceeding, which is similar to a Chapter 11 filing in the U.S., noted the possibility of letting Mt. Gox continue business operations \”in order to increase repayments to our creditors.\”The bankruptcy filing in Japan came after Mt. Gox abruptly shuttered its website, leaving users unable to trade or access the bitcoins stored in the exchange, and followed days of halts on bitcoin withdrawals.\”Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community,\” the application for civil rehabilitation in Japan said.–Saumya VaishampayanFollow Saumya @saumvaish.Read more on MarketWatch about bitcoin:Why the digital currency may be more secure in analog formHow history explains bitcoin, Mt.

186	"Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 U.S. bankruptcy protection on March 9, a follow up to a similar filing in Japan in late February.Chapter 15 protection allows for insolvent international companies to benefit from the U.S. court system. It is not exactly clear yet how this will benefit Mt. Gox. The purpose of Chapter 15, and the Model Law on which it is based, is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with insolvency cases involving debtors, assets, claimants and other parties of interest involving more than one country.""Generally, a chapter 15 case is ancillary to a primary proceeding brought in another country, typically the debtor's home country,"" according to the U.S. Federal Court bankruptcy statute.Another report has the Mt. Gox system being hacked over the weekend with someone breaking into Mt. Box CEO Mark Karpeles blog. The hackers allegedly pulled a spreadsheet showing that 950,000 Bitcoins were still on the books. Other tidbits include that Mt. Gox had around 1 million customers as of December, although no personal data was released by these tech hounds.Karpeles has blamed his company's weak security system for the original Bitcoin loss.This is just the latest in a string of moves surrounding Mt. Gox and the Bitcoin world during the last week.Bitcoin itself has been the center of controversy since it was created in 2009. Banks and nations have fretted over what it could do to traditional currencies and the bankruptcy of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox last month is causing further worries over the viability of the currency and the fact that the largest such exchange simply lost or could not find 850,000 Bitcoins priced at the time at around $500 billion.That is a lot of money, real or digital.Then, last week the burner was turned on full blast with the revelation by Newsweek that the mysterious man behind Bitcoin was an unassuming, retired engineer named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto has denied he is the brains behind Bitcoin and that until recently he had never even heard about Bitcoin, but Newsweek is sticking by its story.Since then Nakamoto has had to lead a life more akin to a Hollywood celebrity, with dozens of reporters chasing his every move.The urge to discover who truly is the founder of the digital currency is understandable. That person could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and if a face could be connected with the service it could help make it even more successful or at least save it from an early death.A famous definition of money is that it's an idea backed by confidence, something that is lacking right now. A currency depends on people believing that it is a safe haven and there is little reason for any confidence to be placed on Bitcoin now with the only names associated with Bitcoin either denying their affiliation or trying to explain why their firm went bankrupt or dying.The most important failure may well be that the entire Bitcoin universe is nothing but a house of cards waiting to topple.""Mt. Gox is not alone. Forty-five percent of Bitcoin exchanges to date have failed, in most cases with their customers' money. The digital currency industry's track record on fiduciary responsibility is abysmal,"" wrote Ken Griffith.The other aspect of this that has to be studied is whether or not a currency, digital or otherwise, can be sustainable without being governed and backed by a national entity.At Hackingdistributed.com Bitcoin exchanges were compared to the infamous Nigerian prince Internet scams, but these are actually targeted at tech-savvy people.""Even if the Bitcoin protocol were perfect, and it isn't, our computing infrastructure is not up to the task of handling high-value transactions. The exchanges are built on the latest hyped technologies that have incredibly poor guarantees, and routinely run into technical problems,"" the site wrote.Sign up for our email newsletter today.Tech Times' biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.By clicking on 'Submit' button above, you confirm that you accept Tech Times Terms & ConditionsAncientMedicineAncientEarth/EnvironmentVideo Games

188	6 Min Read(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud. Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers. The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit. The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse. “This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.” Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency. An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing. “We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper. Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding. The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles. Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7. Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted. Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners. The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company. Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States. It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations. Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French. When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking. He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing. Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight. The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup. The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary. The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.

Gox has been forced to file for bankruptcy in the US in the hope of climbing out of the huge hole it's found itself in. Still reeling from the loss of 850,000 Bitcoins (currently worth around $549 million) and debts of more than $63.6 million, the company has filed papers that will temporarily suspend US legal action against it, allowing it to work out how ""weaknesses in the system"" allowed the digital currency to go missing in the first place. It's not quite the news customers were hoping for, but it's a logical move by Mt. Gox as it will better protect investors located outside of Japan and could also open avenues for it to take on financial aid. While it continues to piece together exactly what happened, some are taking matters into their own hands. Over the weekend, hackers reportedly gained access to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog as well as his Tumblr and Reddit accounts, accusing the company of fraud and alleging it kept some of the Bitcoins that had been reported stolen.

Gox has been accused of pocketing its users’ cash by a group of hackers who infiltrated the personal blog and Reddit account of the service’s CEO.The repository made headlines last month after £200 million worth of Bitcoins were allegedly stolen by hackers, forcing the organisation to file for bankruptcy protection in Japan and close its doors.The company claimed in the bankruptcy filing that it had lost 750,000 customer Bitcoins, as well as 100,000 company-owned ones too.However, a separate group of hackers have now accused the firm of pocketing at least some of the money it told users had been stolen.According to a report by Forbes, the hackers gained access to the Reddit account and personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles to post a missive detailing their accusations.“It’s time that MTGOX got the Bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote.The term “Goxed” is often used by Mt. Gox users to describe instances where the site has gone offline or experienced other technical issues.The group also reportedly posted a 716 megabyte file to Karpeles’ personal website that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox’s servers about the organisation’s finances.The hackers said it shows the company has a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins, and have used it to pour scorn on Mt. Gox’s assertion that users’ money had been lost.Karpeles was unresponsive to requests for comment from Forbes, and – at the time of writing – the hackers’ claims were still awaiting verification.In the meantime, industry watchers have started questioning why no evidence has been uncovered to date about how the stolen Bitcoins are being spent, fuelling speculation they may not have been stolen at all.

Two weeks ago, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan.The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m, £38m, €46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.The Tokyo-based company was the largest and most well-known bitcoin exchange in the world when the cryptocurrency shot to fame last year.The exchange claims that problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins than were being recorded by the exchange.Known as ""transaction malleability"", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.The exchange's collapse led to the price of bitcoin crashing but the virtual currency has shown remarkable resilience and the price of the cryptocurrency has bounced back and is currently trading at £381 on the Coindesk index."

                                        Hackers say the now-bankrupt Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been less than honest about money lost in a major security lapse. Yesterday, they hacked into CEO Mark Karpeles' blog and Reddit account, announcing that the company had kept currency it claimed was stolen, Forbes reports. They said they'd hacked Mt. Gox's servers, and posted a file full of data suggesting the exchange had a balance of 951,116 bitcoins. Hackers say that points to fraud after the company claimed it lost 750,000 of users' bitcoins.
                                    
                                        The authenticity of the document isn't entirely clear, though some Reddit posters noted that personal account information revealed in the file appeared accurate, CNET notes. Still, it's possible that the balance shows money that was already lost in the security breach, reflecting bad accounting rather than theft, the Verge reports. Meanwhile, a bitcoin forum user said he or she was trying to sell 20 gigabytes of stolen information from Mt. Gox—a database that holds user details, including passport scans. ""Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses (sic) from gox closure,"" the user said. The price: 100 bitcoins, or some $63,000, Forbes notes.

200	"Hacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US, having already filed in Japan last month, and seen its CEO’s blog vandalized with claims of exactly how much of investors’ virtual cash was lost. The bankruptcy filing, on Sunday, March 9th, follows revelations by Mt. Gox that hackers broke into its digital vaults and drained them, leaving the Japanese company $63.6m in debt. 
The Japanese bankruptcy filing was made on February 28th, MarketWatch reports, but now has been extended to a US filing under Chapter 15. That’s the part of the bankruptcy process which facilitates representatives of non-US companies from accessing the US legal system, such as when assets in the US are at stake.Whether that will mean US investors who had their bitcoins holdings stored with Mt. Gox will ever see any of their money back is unclear at this stage. Also unclear is just how much was stolen. Mt. Gox originally declared 744,408 bitcoins had been taken, but documents acquired by hackers over the weekend claim the figure is more like 951,116. The alleged numbers – as well as other details – were posted to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ own blog.“We stole no bitcoins” the hackers added. “There were none to steal.”

201	"Hackers have released what they claim are genuine documents which they say prove the stricken exchange still controls almost a million Bitcoins.As Bitcoin exchange MtGox was filing for bankruptcy in the US on Sunday, a group of hackers took over MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog, which has since been taken down, and posted a 716MB file they claimed they had snatched from MtGox's servers.Although the document's veracity cannot be confirmed, it suggested the exchange was still in possession of 951,116 Bitcoins.MtGox's US bankruptcy case was filed under Chapter 15, which is used to handle bankruptcy cases where parties are based in more than one country. This comes two weeks after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan.“It’s time that MtGox got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote.However, even if the leaked docs are genuine, it does not necessarily prove wrongdoing. It is still unclear what exactly happened to MtGox that caused it to file for bankruptcy protection. It may be that its systems still show a huge balance even though the Bitcoins have all disappeared, because any theft may not been properly recorded.MtGox also released a statement (PDF) warning former users of a number of phishing attacks that may be directed at them.Meanwhile, Dorian Nakamoto, the man Newsweek controversially accused of being the inventor of Bitcoin, has kept a dignified silence whilst the world frantically debates whether or not he was wrongly identified as the creator of the cryptocurrency.Someone claiming to be Dorian's brother Arthur Nakamoto – who was supposedly quoted in the Newsweek article – took to Reddit and issued various bizarre statements about the alleged Bitcoin brainbox.""Mis-quoting and blatant lies are unfortunately the journalistic world that exist today,"" the other supposed Nakamoto wrote. ""I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.""He added: ""I understand that I will be mis-quoted and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. What I wanted to do is to plead to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. What's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is that I cannot physically go to to see him and my mother to be of family support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger."" ®

Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.The once-dominant Bitcoin trading post filed for Chapter 15 in the U.S. on Sunday. This particular chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.On 28 February, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. However, by filing for Chapter 15 in the United States, foreign debtors and parties are able to use the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts and systems. This means that Mt. Gox's insolvency now reaches beyond the confines of Tokyo, and the U.S. is able to work with other countries and connected parties around the world in order to better solve the case and protect the interests of all creditors as well as Mt. Gox and its remaining assets.

UPDATE: Mt. Gox has closed the bitcoin exchange and filed for bankruptcy in Japan.

As Mt. Gox accounts for investors worldwide, it makes sense that this secondary bankruptcy filing has occurred. Through Chapter 15, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court will generally defer to the actions of a foreign court -- in this case, in Japan, as the primary place for bankruptcy procedures. However, when circumstances do not violate laws or public policy in the U.S., Chapter 15 also allows aid to be offered to the foreign company filing for bankruptcy protection.The Bitcoin exchange shut down abruptly last month, closing its Twitter feed and rendering itself mute for over a week before announcing that Mt. Gox was closing its doors. In total, according to Mt. Gox's announcement that it was filing for Japanese bankruptcy protection (.PDF), approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox disappeared, which is worth roughly $500 million in today's trading rates.Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said the loss -- 
taking place over several years
 -- was due to ""weaknesses in the system"" which allowed cyberattacks and Bitcoin theft to occur.
Over the weekend
, anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to Mt. Gox systems and lifted apparent evidence that customer investments were not the target of theft, but instead are still being held at the exchange as part of a fraudulent plot by Mt.

Breaking News!


MtGox boss Mark Karpeles has been targeted by hackers following the company's recent bankruptcy protection filing.The Bitcoin magnate's personal blog and Reddit account were breached, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.The leaked material includes an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million transactions, entries from the firm's business ledger and details about its admin software.""It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" said the hackers in a statement accompanying the data dump.MtGox went dark last month after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around £210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole.It remains unclear whether the information leaked by hackers was genuine and sheds any light on the incident, according to Forbes.PREVIOUS ARTICLENEXT ARTICLE

""On Sunday,"" reports Forbes, ""hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users.""The blog has since been taken down, but the hackers' message is available on Pastebin. ""It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.""The message provides a link to a zip file. ""Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.""The hackers also provide what they claim to be the balances of virtual currencies still existent  – and it includes more than 950,000 bitcoins. This alone is proof of nothing. Forbes points out, ""I couldn’t verify that Sunday’s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox’s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins–that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.""Nevertheless, the lack of movement for the stolen bitcoins has puzzled the community. On Friday, however, writing in Coindesk, Danny Bradbury noted that a wallet most likely owned by Mt Gox had started to be active. This wallet had been dormant until July 2012, when it started receiving small transactions. ""However,"" writes Bradbury, ""no coins left that wallet, until today, when its 50,000 bitcoins were sent to another address, as part of outputs from various bitcoin addresses totaling 180,000 bitcoins ($113 million).""Since then, he continues, ""these coins have been rapidly splitting, with coins being subdivided repeatedly. One branch was found to have been splitting every 30 minutes in what appeared to be an automated fashion. This suggests that there may be some code splitting the coins.""Why this is happening is not so clear. ""One explanation is that it makes the coins easier to use for a high volume of transactions,"" suggests Bradbury. Another possibility, of course, is that it also makes them harder to trace. It is not absolutely clear that the bitcoins concerned are still 'owned' by Mt Gox, but bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell suggests they are. ""Maxwell also argued that the splitting behavior is consistent with a function in the leaked source code from Mt Gox,"" writes Bradbury. ""This suggests that some of the coins have been dropped into the Mt Gox online wallet, and that the system is now automatically breaking them up, he said.""One thing is clear: the Mt Gox debacle is still posing more questions than it is providing answers."

Mt. Gox was the world’s largest bitcoin exchange until about 850,000 bitcoin were allegedly stolen during a breach, forcing the exchange to shut down and file for bankruptcy protection. According to new claims from anonymous hackers, however, the heist never occurred and Karpeles still controls nearly 1 million bitcoin worth approximately $596 million at Monday’s exchange rate.According to a report from Forbes, the anonymous hackers took over Karpeles’s blog and published a post supposedly exposing fraud committed by the CEO. The post was also published on Pastebin.“It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] bitcoin community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote. “This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of [our] ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than [we] would have liked to verify the data.” The hackers’ note was accompanied by a file containing what they claim to be evidence of fraud. They say that they have managed to obtain various personal data belonging to Karpeles, including what they claim to be evidence that Mt. Gox’s current bitcoin balance is in fact 951,116, which would mean that the 850,000 bitcoin the exchange claimed was stolen is still in its control.As Forbes noted, however, the evidence may in fact simply reveal remarkably poor accounting practices at Mt. Gox, a former hub for trading “Magic: The Gathering” cards, rather than fraud.Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox’s claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.Karpeles’ blog was titled “Magical Tux in Japan—Geekness brought me to Japan!” Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname “MagicalTux” when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline on Sunday shortly after it was attacked.A screenshot of Karpeles' hacked blog. (Click to enlarge; strong language.)Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users’ personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles’ CV and a Windows executable called “TibanneBackOffice,” among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.Mt. Gox’s demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin’s public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.One of the files released by hackers claiming to have compromised Mt. Gox is a screenshot of what appears to be a SQL database tool.Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin’s core software who’ve said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user’s public bitcoin “address” or “wallet,” which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox’s bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.In a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.“There’s a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it’s very, very difficult, and it’s tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it’s just obvious,” he said.The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cybercrime thefts on record.An academic paper published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.“For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange,” they wrote.Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.“A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money,” said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. “This is serious money for serious people.”Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.If that’s the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.PCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.Visit other IDG sites:Copyright © 2018 IDG Communications, Inc."

213	"But don't go clicking any links found in the spreadsheet the hackers posted, for There Be Trojans.Update: Mt Gox has filed for US bankruptcy protection. CEO Karpales says, in the statement accompanying the bankruptcy protection documents, that it would ""allow Mt Gox a necessary breathing period for it to focus on its restructuring efforts without the distraction that would result if certain litigation currently pending in the United States were allowed to proceed.""According to Karpales, Mt Gox has $63.9 million in liabilities and approximately $37.7 million in assets. Karpales also claims that the hack which took down Mt Gox stole approximately 7% of the world's Bitcoin supply.Source: Ars TechnicaOriginal Story:One of the things that's been puzzling the Bitcoin community is, if the Mt Gox wallet really was emptied by person or persons unknown, where did all the coins go? You'd think a transaction of that size would show up in the public ledger of transactions, runs the theory. Those of you following all things Bitcoin related may remember that other self-appointed investigators followed a very similar theory searching for Sheep Marketplace's Bitcoin, with dismal results. Now some of Mt Gox's customers have hacked the personal blog and Reddit account of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpales, posting what they claim is evidence of fraud. Or, as they prefer to put it, evidence that they've been Goxed.The hackers posted messages, since removed from Karpales' blog and Reddit, claiming that they had discovered where Karpales stored the loot. The hackers claim Karpales kept back 951,116 Bitcoin, though this claim may not be all it seems.For one, as Forbes points out, the spreadsheet posted by the hackers may simply indicate how badly Mt Gox dropped the ball; that all those figures show is what Mt Gox thought it had, not what it actually possessed.For another, the information posted seems to be infested with Trojans. The posts included genuine Mt Gox data mixed in with a healthy helping of .exe and Mac.app files, some of which are actually Bitcoin stealing viruses disguised as back office tools. Should you go looking for the files yourself, you're advised not to open them.One poster says that the data was obtained by installing a rootkit months ago on one of Mt Gox's servers via known Gentoo Linux distribution flaws, and the installation was successful because Karpales didn't bother to update. This same poster, nanashi, claimed to have access to much of Mt Gox's customer data in a 20GB stolen database, possibly including bank details, passwords, usernames, even passport scans. Nanashi offered this database for sale for 100 Bitcoin.  ""Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure,"" he says.Source: ForbesServed from: 192.168.10.91 | Version: com"	Business
214	Illustration: Lu Ting/GTLast week, Canadian-based online bitcoin bank Flexcoin was forced to close down after losing about $600,000 in the virtual currency to hackers. The shuttering came hot on the heels of the collapse of MtGox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan at the end of last month after someone hacked into its system and stole some 850,000 bitcoins, representing around 7 percent of the estimated global total of the digital currency.For the beleaguered bitcoin market, these thefts are just the tip of the iceberg. Unless bitcoin can recover its credibility, these recent setbacks could mark its demise.For a decentralized currency like bitcoin, confidence means everything. When hacker attacks caused several bitcoin exchanges, including MtGox, to suspend withdrawals of the currency in February, its value plummeted down below $600, compared to a peak of $1,124 in late November.Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin has become increasingly popular thanks to its ease of global transaction, difficulty in counterfeiting, high standardization, decentralization and inflation immunity due to a hard limit of 21 million. Compared to real-world currencies, perhaps the most unique feature of bitcoins is its decentralization, which means that the value of the digital currency is set independently of any bank or government.However, the decentralized nature of bitcoin is also a fatal flaw for the crypto-currency as there's nothing real to support its credibility; unlike gold for example, which is a physical commodity that has intrinsic value. As bitcoins do not have a financially sound issuer or any institutional valuation basis, its price could be very volatile and easily affected by outside factors. Looking back, losses of bitcoins to hackers have happened several times in the past, shaking investor confidence and causing sharp plunges in its prices. So for a currency which relies on user trust, if its credibility foundation is compromised, then its value would suffer enormously.In the meantime, hacker attacks are just one of the risks facing bitcoins. Since the online virtual currency has aroused concerns over financial stability, money laundering and other illegal activities, many governments are considering restrictions against bitcoins. Unlike a traceable credit card or online banking transfer, bitcoin transactions are relatively similar to cash transactions in that they are both nearly impossible to trace. The Silk Road, an eBay-like bitcoin exchange that included listings for guns and heroin, was recently shut down by the US authorities, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Canada was said to be tightening rules to keep closer track of virtual currencies to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Also, in December 2013, the largest bitcoin exchange in China was required to stop accepting deposits in renminbi, a move which drove prices down considerably. Given investor complaints pertaining to the collapse of MtGox, more regulatory scrutiny and restrictions could be expected in the coming years.While hacker attacks and tightened regulations may hurt its value, bitcoin copycats are meanwhile undermining its status as a unique virtual currency. Even though only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created, the crypto-currency market can expand limitlessly as new alternatives to bitcoins can always be created without laws or regulations to stop copycats. In the wake of bitcoin's success last year, a variety of competing crypto-currencies were quickly introduced. In fact, there were already more than 140 copycats by the end of 2013. In this sense, it could be just a matter of time before bitcoins lose their uniqueness. Take litecoin, currently the most popular bitcoin alternative, as an example. By the end of last year, the total circulation value of litecoin had exceeded $1 billion.Nonetheless, bitcoin is an obvious breakthrough in terms of financial market innovation. Maybe its most fundemental problem now is that it's too surreal and forward-looking, at least from the point of view of existing political and economic establishments. While bitcoin hints at future evolutions in the world financial market, it may be too early yet for the world to completely embrace it.The author is a CCTV financial commentator. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cnChina Business News	Business

    Former Macquarie banker Joe Lee and Wall Street investment adviser George Samman suspected something was wrong with Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox in the closing months of 2013.The founders behind Singapore-based derivatives trader BTC.sx had begun withdrawing money as early as December, fearing the premium Mt.Gox users paid for Bitcoins was a sign of liquidity issues at the Tokyo-based exchange.But it didn’t stop Lee and Samman from sustaining a six-figure loss when Mt.Gox finally went under last month.“We were one of Mt.Gox’s biggest customers but we got no inside ­information from them at all,"" says ­Samman, chief operating officer at the trader. “They couldn’t answer any questions so it was useless. We were lucky to get off what we needed to get off before the whole thing went down.""In Melbourne, 22-year-old Bitcoin trader Karl Kloppenborg was also burned by the fall of Mt.Gox.An IT entrepreneur who is building his own Bitcoin exchange, Kloppenborg lost $47,000 in the collapse.“I realised something was wrong much earlier on – I threatened legal action, and said I’d call the banks,"" he says. “It became a waiting game when I realised that the money was essentially frozen.""The failure of Bitcoin’s most public face is just one in a series of hiccups for the fast-rising virtual currency, after raids on online black market SilkRoad, which dealt solely in Bitcoins, and the purported unmasking of Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto (later denied by Nakamoto).For a mathematical code which has seen its value rise from several US ­dollars to the thousands in just five years – to be worth $US10 billion at its height – the loss of 744,000 Bitcoins (worth $527 million at Monday’s average exchange rate) was no doubt a shock to Bitcoin users, many of whom dedicated their trust to the service.And the community is no doubt outraged. Despite statements from Mt.Gox that the loss was a theft, resulting from flaws in the system’s code, those demanding vigilante justice have attacked the online accounts of Mt.Gox’s former chief 
 
  Mark Karpeles
 , publishing his personal information and the purported bank balance of the company in 18 different currencies, including nearly $A1 million.The information has fuelled speculation that Mt.Gox’s collapse is more fraud than theft, but provides ­little hope that users will have their Bitcoins returned.In an email trail seen by The Australian Financial Review between ­Kloppenborg and Mt.Gox staff, the exchange admitted it was unable to process ­Bitcoin withdrawals quickly due to difficulty dealing with major banks.It’s a problem that Bitcoin trader David Parrish says needs to be fixed.“It’s still quite difficult to buy ­Bitcoins,"" says Parrish, a software en­gineer at Google Australia. Instead of transferring money through online exchanges, Parrish buys and sells ­Bitcoins by physically meeting with like-minded traders.However, despite a seemingly catastrophic blow to a burgeoning system, Mt.Gox’s failure appeared to expose just how little an effect one exchange could have on the global system. Though Mt.Gox’s own price collapsed from $US1209 to $US122 shortly before bankruptcy, the average price in the wider market has managed to sustain a $500 average since its collapse, and even risen slightly in recent weeks. Its price remains volatile but it seems those committed to Bitcoin are sticking with it. “People have been looking for reasons to not trust Bitcoin,"" says ­Samman. “But I think it’s a short-term negative and long-term positive.“You get rid of a bad player which was actually becoming detrimental to the liquidity of Bitcoin itself. It will cause people to want to have more regulation than they have in the past.""Governments globally have salivated over the prospect of regulating the currency. Russia has banned ­Bitcoin while China has restricted how banks play with the currency. Japan is contemplating rules as regulators in New York float the idea of a ­Bitcoin licence.In Australia, however, Reserve Bank governor 
 
  Glenn Stevens
  told a parliamentary committee on Friday that he was “not inclined to feel that we have to rush in as a regulator"".“We have seen some pretty substantial losses incurred by Bitcoin holders in a couple of jurisdictions just in recent weeks,"" he said. “It is a potential alternative currency so how it will hold its value is the first question. There have been countless currencies through history and the ones that survive are the ones that hold value.""Samman says BTC.sx will join the list of 127,000 creditors seeking retribution from Mt.Gox but is unsure how regulators will even tackle a corporation that deals in assets that countries do not yet recognise.“They probably will have to tread on very careful water, the judges or whoever is involved in this bankruptcy because if they frame it in a certain way they may get a legal precedent for the legitimacy of Bitcoin,"" he says.

Gox suffered about 150,000 hacking attacks per second for several days before its collapse last month, according to a report.Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the exchange was hit by continued distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, during which hackers take control of computers to send large amount of data to a target, resulting in servers to crash.The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many bitcoins were stolen from Mt. Gox, according to the newspaper.Mt Gox, which once hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to DDoS attacks. The company has filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m, £38m, €46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.Problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers reportedly manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins.Known as ""transaction malleability"", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.The exchange's collapse questioned the reliability of bitcoin that suffered a plunge in prices subsequently.Separate investigations are underway in Japan and the US against Mt.

It was not yet clear whether the information dumps were real or shed new light on what had happened at the exchange, said Forbes staff writer Andy Greenberg. He pointed out that although $465m in bitcoins (approximately 744,000 coins) had supposedly gone astray from MtGox, no activity suggesting they had been traded had been seen in the blockchain - the central list of buying and selling that underpins the entire Bitcoin network.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesThe boys were on their way to a birthday party when they were hit by a car in west London.

Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox's claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.Karpeles' blog was titled ""Magical Tux in Japan -- Geekness brought me to Japan!"" Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname ""MagicalTux"" when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline Sunday shortly after it was attacked.Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users' personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles' CV and a Windows executable called ""TibanneBackOffice,"" among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.Mt. Gox's demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin's public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin's core software who've said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user's public bitcoin ""address"" or ""wallet,"" which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox's bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.In a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.""There's a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it's very, very difficult, and it's tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it's just obvious,"" he said.The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated US$474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cybercrime thefts on record.An academic paper published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.""For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange,"" they wrote.Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.""A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money,"" said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. ""This is serious money for serious people.""Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.If that's the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.Send news tips and comments to jeremy_kirk@idg.com.

223	"Japan-based Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox has been dysfunctional, bankrupt and shrouded with a veil of mystery for weeks. The site's owners said in February 744,408 bitcoins were stolen due to a glitch in the Bitcoin protocol and took the site down, but updates were scarce since then. Now, unidentified hackers claim they have data, including database dumps, that proves Mt. Gox's owners actually kept the bitcoins for themselves.See also: The Comparative Anatomy of the Xbox One vs. PlayStation 4According to a report by Forbes, Hackers claim to have stolen the data from Mt. Gox's servers; they also took control of CEO Mark Karpeles' Reddit account and personal blog. ""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,"" hackers wrote, claiming no user database dumps have been included. The data comprises of a spreadsheet of more than a million trades on Mt. Gox as well as a 716MB file that appears to show Mt. Gox's balance in 18 currencies, including bitcoin. The file points to a balance of 951,116 bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox, with a note saying ""That fat f*ck has been lying."" At the current exchange rate on bitcoin exchange BTC-e.com, that amount of bitcoins is worth approximately $595 million. Early reports on Reddit claim the database file is genuine, but it's hard to confirm anything at this point, especially since many of the related posts on Reddit have been deleted. Mt.Gox did not directly respond to the incident, but it did put a warning notice over the weekend, claiming that phishing emails impersonating Mt.Gox were being sent to users and warning them not to respond to these emails.

Following the closure of Mt. Gox and the theft of Bitcoins worth millions, anonymous hackers claim to have published evidence that customer Bitcoin is not missing -- but instead is held at the heart of attempted fraud.Last month, the 
abrupt closure and week-long silence
 of Mt. Gox and its team frustrated, confused and angered investors. Once the dominant trading post for the cryptocurrency, Mt. Gox closed its doors after saying that cybercriminals managed to steal approximately 850,000 BTC, worth over $500 million, in cyberattacks taking place over several years.Company CEO Mark Karpeles said Bitcoins were lost ""due to weaknesses in the system,"" and while Mt. Gox has now filed for bankruptcy in Japan, thousands of users have been left out of pocket -- as well as in the dark over their investments' future.Now embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings, Karpeles and Mt. Gox staff have gone quiet, but this hasn't stopped other parties from trying to get to the bottom of the issue. Over the weekend, anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to the trading post and accessed to Mt. Gox data. After taking over Karpeles' blog and Reddit account over the weekend, on Pastebin, the group who broke in to the system said:""It’s time that Mt. Gox got the Bitcoin communities' wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data [...] Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.""According to Forbes, the 716 megabyte file dump appears to include personal data including Karpeles’ home address and resume, an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, Mt. Gox's Bitcoin balance and screenshots of the hackers' access to such information through database cracking.

                        The Mt. Gox bitcoin debacle: Bankruptcy filed, customer bitcoin lost
                    
UPDATE: Mt. Gox has closed the bitcoin exchange and filed for bankruptcy in Japan.

Within the Pastebin summary, the hackers claim that the trading posts' current balance is 951,116 BTC, which if true, means that customer Bitcoin has not been lost -- and therefore fraud has been committed.It is worth noting that this leak could show nothing more than poor accountancy practices -- one aspect of the company which has been reported as a crucial factor which led to the original cyberattacks going unnoticed for so long -- and the database may only show Bitcoins that were believed to be safe but were already gone. However, since Mt. Gox has filed for bankruptcy protection, the public ledger of Bitcoin transactions -- the Bitcoin blockchain -- has not registered the movement of ""stolen"" coins.In related news, whether or not Mt. Gox personnel have sought to capitalize on their customers, cybercriminals have jumped upon the demise of the Bitcoin trading post in their own way to profit.According to a press release (.PDF) issued by Mt. Gox, phishing campaigns have been making the rounds. Within the spam emails, hackers have used Mt. Gox's identity and asked for the name, address, username, password and bank account numbers of those who have lost Bitcoin.IntelIntel will soon stop being a PC-centric companyTech Industry2018's $51B IT renewal deals may not be as sweet as they seemTech IndustryAU$5m tax bill sees Lenovo Australia & New Zealand post AU$699k profitStart-UpsMeg Whitman named CEO of digital media startup NewTV© 2018 CBS Interactive.

226	"The debacle surrounding Mt. Gox continues to rumble on as CEO Mark Karpeles remains silent following his application for bankruptcy at the end of last month.Over the weekend hackers released information they claim shows Karpeles continues to lie about the amount of bitcoin stolen from the exchange, however the continuing uncertainty over what exactly happened at Mt. Gox doesn't seem to have impacted the value of cryptocurrencies in general.According to stats from CoinMarketCap.com, bitcoin's value rose 3% in the last 24 hours to $640, continuing to show resilience in the face of the Mt. Gox uncertainty. While the cryptocurrency is still some way off its high of $1,200, it is proving some naysayers wrong by remaining relatively stable in the face of widespread upheaval.Bitcoin's relative stability has buoyed the rest of the cryptocurrency market, with 11 of the top 15 mineable cryptocurrencies showing a rise in value in the last day.The big winner however was the eco-focused mintcoin which rose some 30% in value in the last 24 hours.Hackers claim Mt. Gox CEO Karpeles is lyingOver the weekend hackers posted account transaction information from beleaguered Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, claiming CEO Mark Karpeles was lying about the amount of bitcoins the company had before it filed for bankruptcy.The stolen information claims to show a ledger balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which is over 100,000 more than Karpeles claimed was stolen from his exchange when he filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called ""Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!"" and posted the stolen information there.Karpeles is remaining silent about the accusations for now.The bitcoin-friendly gunstoreThe reputation of bitcoin was for years hampered by its connection to illicit marketplaces on the dark web - such as Silk Road - where you could anonymously buy everything from drugs to machine guns.Now one businessman is looking to get remove that stigma by allowing people to purchase guns using bitcoin directly in its store. The firearm shop and training centre Central Texas Gunworks , based in Austin, has installed a bitcoin ATM to allow those wishing to purchase a gun using the cryptocurrency to do so.However, unlike on the dark web, you won't be able to buy any firearms anonymously as the same paperwork and background checks required of anyone will still apply. Even online buyers can only have firearms shipped to a nearby gun store where the same legal process applies.Dogecoin on BitPay before LitecoinAccording to a comment from the CEO of Bitcoin payment processor startup BitPay, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin could be the next virtual currency accepted on the platform – even before the world's second biggest cryptocurrency litecoin.Reddit user and dogecoin enthusiast jimmy0x52 claims to have spoken to CEO of BitPay Tony Gallippi at music, film, and interactive conference SXSW which is taking place in Texas this week. Gallippi is reported to have said:""Think about the consumer - if they have LTC [litecoin] they have BTC [bitcoin]. Doge is really popular and a whole new marketplace currency""This is contrary to a tweet from BitPay in February, when it said: ""Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin. Much currency, such persistence. Wow.""BitPay has yet to officially confirm its plans for accepting other cryptocurrencies, but with more than 10,000 bitcoin-accepting merchants on its books, the addition of dogecoin to a platform like BitPay could be huge for the young cryptocurrency.Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin.

UPDATED 04:14 EST . 10 MARCH 2014

When MtGox suddenly shut up show with $400 million worth of ‘missing’ Bitcoins last month, the owners of the exchange stated that hackers were responsible for this loss. Whoever had raided MtGox has successfully exploited the transaction malleability bug to divert these funds from the exchange, or so its owners claimed. But suspicions have lingered over how true the hacker story really is, with some claiming that the owners may have simply pocketed the cash for themselves.Now, following MtGox’s unnerving silence since it made an application for bankruptcy just over a week ago, a group of hackers claims to have broken into the site’s network to find out what the real story is.According to a report in Forbes, the hacker or hackers successfully compromised Mark Karpeles’ personal blog and Reddit account, before using these two platforms to post ‘evidence’ that the MtGox CEO still had access to some of the missing Bitcoins. They also provided a series of files to support these claims, including a spreadsheet that details over a million Bitcoin transactions; a screenshot that appears to confirm the hackers gained access to MtGox’s network; and Karpeles’ home address.The hackers also presented a file that show’s MtGox’s bank balance in 18 different currencies. Most tellingly, this file shows that it still has a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins – something that hackers say is ‘evidence’ that the exchange’s owners still have quite a stash of BTC. As the hacker’s so eloquently point out, “That fat fuck has been lying!!”Here’s the full text of the message from the hackers:*** SAVE THIS POST, MIRROR THE FILES, REPOST, SHARE AND KEEP THIS DATA AVAILABLE ***http://blog.magicaltux.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MtGox2014Leak.ziphttp://89.248.171.30/MtGox2014Leak.zipFirst and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles. Fuck that bitch-titted motherfucker.
It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.
Above you will finding download link and a mirror used without asking from Mark Karpeles very own blog.magicaltux.net.
Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.

However, Bitcoin users have yet to see these missing Bitcoins appear on the public blockchain, which suggests that whoever does have the money is keeping it stashed somewhere.This weekend’s ‘hack’ comes just days after someone attempted to sell a file containing the personal details and passport scans of MtGox’s users on the BitcoinTalk forum.

228	Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said Sunday.The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said.MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that the company owned.Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.Japanese officials have said they were closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.Cryptocurrency Prices across Indian exchangesFor the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.Advertisement30:20 02:20 02:21 02:49 06:22  More Videos  PS4 Is a Best-Seller but Here Are 4 Reasons It's Far From PerfectFrom Food to Streaming, We Need Aggregators for Our AggregatorsMy New Year's Resolution: Read Less (Internet), Read More (Books)	Business
229	"The latest twist in the fall of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is here, as CEO Mark Karpeles, personal blog, MagicalTux.net (along with his Tumblr and Reddit accounts) has apparently been hacked. Whoever has control now used them to post a ""MtGox2014Leak.zip"" that claims to show ""relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data."" We wouldn't recommend downloading the file or running its included executable (pictured above, it claims to be from Mt. Gox parent company Tibanne Ltd.), but some already have. Several posters on Reddit and Twitter report they've verified their personal account balances with the data in it -- also available as an Excel spreadsheet -- tied to the user id included in their first Mt. Gox registration e-mail.Update: No one has commented on the database leak, but Mt. Gox has updated its website tonight with a spam warning (PDF) claiming that phishing emails are being sent to former users. Considering that personal details may be among data loosed from the exchange's servers, if you used the same password on MtGox.com and other sites, we'd recommend changing it right away.[Image credit: Reddit]MtGox posts ""Spam warning"" day after corporate data breach revealing deceit. https://t.co/WZ7J10PhYO pic.twitter.com/ig37RWA2kCIf the leaked information is valid (and, if valid, accurate, considering Mt. Gox's vulnerability and accounting issues), it reports a sum of 951,116.21905382 Bitcoins deposited by users. During a news conference in Japan, Karpeles claimed 850,000 Bitcoins (worth around $549 million at current prices) had disappeared due to ""weaknesses in the system,"" while bankruptcy filings claimed a debt of $63.6 million. How many Bitcoins were really left in the vault, what happened to the rest and whether or not account holders will ever get their currency back is still unknown.Forbes points out a (now deleted) forum post that offered a 20GB Mt. Gox database file for sale at a price of 100 Bitcoins. The poster claimed it holds personal details and even passport scans of the site's users, which only adds to the concerns of anyone who had an account before the exchange shut down last month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin watchers have noticed $113 million in coins linked to Mt. Gox accounts moving through the blockchain (check out our Primed article to find out how mining and transaction verifications work) recently, which Coindesk suggests could be preparation to use them ""for a high volume of transactions.""In an era of streaming services, how does one establish -- and back up -- a music collection?The best long-form writing on technology and more on the web.HomePods and Clips everywhere.From 50 US cities to 200.But it could take a month or more to show up."

230	After Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox reported last month that it lost nearly $500 million worth of users’ bitcoins in a security lapse, many users were not convinced with the explanation from the exchange’s owners.While Mt. Gox did not provide further information about the attack, which reportedly exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, a group of hackers claimed Sunday that they broke into Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ personal blog, and found a discrepancy in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins Mt. Gox claimed were stolen in February's security lapse. According to a report from Forbes, the hackers gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Karpeles and posted a message, claiming that the exchange still had access to some of the bitcoins that Karpeles had reported stolen.The hackers uploaded a series of files, including a spreadsheet of anonymous user accounts with details of bitcoin balances, Karpeles' home address, and a screenshot allegedly verifying the hackers' access to the data. In addition, the hackers also posted a 716MB zip file claimed to contain stolen data from Mt. Gox servers. Here is the link to the data on Pastebin.“First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles,” the hackers wrote. “It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed… Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with f***ing Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.”The data posted by the hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, claiming it had lost 750,000 customer bitcoins, in addition to 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.While the authenticity of Sunday’s database dump has not yet been confirmed, some Reddit users said they had found that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, CNET reported.Subscribe	Business
231	Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced a massive hacker offensives last month, coming under 150,000 denial-of-service attacks a second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report says.The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted losing half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since about February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reports.While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of requests for pages and data to the target, crippling its computer system.The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said on Sunday.MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with about 100,000 units the company owned.Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.After trading for cents per bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $US40 a coin in late 2012 and $US1100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the US Federal Reserve Bank had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how bitcoin can be used.Save articles for later.Subscribe for unlimited access to news.

233	Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that has fallen from grace, has not quite reached the bottom just yet. We have just heard word that Mt. Gox’s CEO, Mark Karpeles, had his personal blog that is known as MagicalTux.net, in addition to his Tumblr and Reddit accounts, hacked. The person(s) behind this particular hack also left a “MtGox2014Leak.zip” which allegedly points out “relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data.” Of course, it is highly recommended against downloading any kind of executable file from untrusted sources, but some folks who have decided to take the plunge have verified on Reddit as well as Twitter that their personal account balances, along with the data within, is available as an Excel spreadsheet, being tied in to the User ID that was part of their Mt. Gox registration e-mail.Assuming the leaked information that has appeared is valid, apparently users have already deposited a mountainous sum of 951,116.21905382 Bitcoins. At a news conference in Japan, Karpeles laid claim that 850,000 Bitcoins (which is worth approximately $549 million at the prevailing market price) had vanished, touting a “weaknesses in the system,” with bankruptcy filings claiming a debt of $63.6 million. It remains to be seen just how many Bitcoins remain in the vault, and will account holders actually be on the receiving end of their mined currency eventually?Filed in Computers.

If there’s a lesson to be learned from the bitcoin collapse, it’s that just because an investment is trendy and cool, that doesn’t mean you should abandon all common sense and sink your money into it.“Digital currencies right now are very, very trendy,” said Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board. “There’s a lot of buzz about them. It’s really easy to look at the benefits, the positives of digital currencies, without really appreciating these risks.“Those risks can wipe out the entirety of their investment in not months, not weeks, but in a matter of moments.”Digital currencies like bitcoin are essentially long lines of computer code that may be encrypted and sent or received without involving a financial institution or government agency.“In many ways, digital currencies operate as ‘online cash,’ only this type of currency is extremely volatile and can disappear the same way your money disappears when you lose your wallet,” said John Morgan, Texas securities commissioner.Bitcoin has become increasingly popular among tech enthusiasts, libertarians and risk-seeking investors because it allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money across borders without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties. Criminals like bitcoin for the same reasons.The currency attracted media attention and the fascination of millions as an increasing number of large retailers such as Overstock.com began to accept it.Bitcoin isn’t the only digital currency that’s sprung up.“The last I checked, which was right at the beginning of this year, there were about 14 digital currencies,” Rotunda said. “There’s more of them in production right now, in development. It’s a real fertile ground.”Investors must use caution when dealing with digital currencies, securities regulators said.“Anybody who’s investing in digital currencies is going to be highly dependent upon the securities systems, the infrastructure, the accounting practices, overall business model of whomever they’re entrusting the custody of their investment to,” Rotunda said.What’s more, a lack of regulation of digital currencies leaves investors exposed, he said.“Digital currencies in large part allow users to be anonymous,” Rotunda said. “That makes it hard from a regulatory standpoint to regulate those transactions, but it also fosters an environment that caters to money laundering to conceal transactions to all sorts of situations where a promoter could be playing with investors’ money without their own knowledge.”That includes Ponzi schemes. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that involves payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in investments that promoters claim generate high returns with little or no risk.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil complaint last year that Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney operated a bitcoin-denominated Ponzi scheme under the name Bitcoin Savings and Trust.The SEC alleged that from September 2011 to September 2012 Shavers raised more than 700,000 bitcoins worth about $4.5 million based on bitcoin prices then.“We are concerned that the rising use of virtual currencies in the global marketplace may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes in which these currencies are used to facilitate fraudulent, or simply fabricated, investments or transactions,” the SEC said in an Investor Alert in July. “These schemes often promise high returns for getting in on the ground floor of a growing Internet phenomenon.”Rotunda had advice for investors.“If you’re investing in bitcoins or something tied to bitcoins or other digital currencies, do due diligence on the person promoting the investment,” he said. “Try to look at these things objectively, evaluate their own personal situation. An investment tied to digital currencies may be suitable for someone in their 20s, in their 30s.

Bitcoin was a dream come true for computer geeks, libertarians and big government paranoids.Just imagine a digital currency untethered from government regulators, existing only in the virtual world of computer code and cheaper to use than credit cards.But the recent collapse of a leading bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, has raised concerns about the legitimacy of this virtual currency.A $470 million digital heist last month at the Tokyo-based exchange pushed the company into bankruptcy and left many bitcoin investors empty-handed with little recourse.Mt. Gox chief executive Mark Karpeles offered some hollow condolences during a late February press conference in Tokyo. He basically said, oops, there was a bug in the bitcoin software, which allowed thieves to hack their way into the system and fraudulently withdraw bitcoin.And to think this was supposedly the precursor to a digital Utopia.Investors in traditional currencies — U.S. dollar, Japanese yen or Swiss franc — need a cast iron stomach, a savvy trading strategy and a fat wallet because big losses are inevitable.Breaking news in these markets is like waving a biscuit at a mad dog. It comes fast, and it ain’t pretty.But at least sovereign governments and regulatory authorities stand behind and monitor traditional currencies. While Bitcoin’s exchange rate is even more volatile than traditional currencies, there is no oversight from the FDIC, Federal Reserve or U.S. Treasury.Tyler Moore, an SMU assistant professor in computer science and engineering, said he doesn’t believe the Mt. Gox fiasco will spell the demise of bitcoin, but regulatory safeguards are needed. Moore co-authored a research report last year in which he examined the risks of investing in bitcoin.“The bitcoin ecosystem is in need of regulatory oversight and reform,” he wrote in an email response to my questions. “Bitcoin currency exchanges act like de facto banks. Many customers leave the bitcoins in accounts at the exchanges, but there are no capital requirements as there are for traditional banks.”This makes bitcoin exchanges vulnerable to withdrawal spikes, otherwise known as bank runs. Moore said the security breach at Mt. Gox wiped out the capital reserves of the exchange. He examined the track record of 40 bitcoin exchanges and found that 18 have closed “with customer account balances often wiped out.”Bitcoin was supposedly created about five years ago by a computer programming genius named Satoshi Nakamoto — probably a pseudonym. Nakamoto created 31,000 lines of computer code that essentially created bitcoin, according to The New Yorker magazine.Through this computer program, he set a limit on the amount of Bitcoin that would eventually be available in the system. Only 21 million bitcoins will be created over the next 20 years and currently about 12 million are in virtual circulation, meaning they are held in bitcoin “wallets” inside computers all over the world.When I last wrote about the bitcoin phenomenon last summer, the exchange rate was $100 for one bitcoin. As it gained popularity it topped $1,100 in December.But with the bad publicity swirling around Mt. Gox, one bitcoin now fetches about $500. Some 850,000 bitcoins, or about 7 percent of the bitcoins in circulation, were stolen from Mt. Gox.Moore cited several examples of security breaches at bitcoin exchanges and other frauds. While it didn’t involve an exchange, one of the largest bitcoin Ponzi schemes occurred here in North TexasThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil complaint dated July 23, 2013, that Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney operated a bitcoin denominated Ponzi scheme under the name Bitcoin Savings and Trust.The SEC is seeking monetary penalties and the return of the ill-gotten gains.Perhaps the government can get back some of the lost money for investors if in fact this was a Ponzi scheme. But for the long-term stability of bitcoin, or any digital currency for that matter, Moore advocates some kind of mechanism “to reimburse customers for fraudulent transactions.”An article in The Atlantic probably summed it up best: “No matter how perfect a technological concept is, when it enters the world of human beings, it becomes imperfect. Bitcoin is no exception.”©2018, The Dallas Morning News Inc. All Rights Reserved."	Business

238	"Given how much Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has lost, both in terms of money and trust, it was only a matter of time before hackers struck back. Now such a group of enraged victims have hijacked Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ own blog to reveal just how much the company really lost.
Mt. Gox’s fall from grace is a matter of public knowledge, but the true extent of the damages incurred by the company is unsurprisingly kept behind closed doors. In fact, the entire company’s strategy in dealing with its financial, and now legal, problems were supposed to be a secret until a “crisis strategy draft” document was leaked.The document details the steps the company needs to take in order to appear less culpable, starting from inexplicably disappearing from the Internet, stepping down from the Bitcoin Foundation board, issuing a vague statement explaining the disappearance, and filing for bankruptcy, all of which took place the past weeks. Also notable in that document was the admission that Mt. Gox lost as much as 744,408 bitcoins due to a bug, amounting to around $340 million at that time. It seems, however, that the real, undisclosed figures are far worse.Hackers dived into Mt. Gox’s database not to steal bitcoins, or so the hackers said, but to get their hands on databases that will reveal the truth. With a hint of poetic justice, these same hackers used Karpeles’ blog to post database dumps and other files that they were able to acquire. Among those is a list of the actual Bitcoin balances, which revealed the real number to be 951,116 bitcoins. That amount is a far cry from that in the leaked document as well as the numbers given by Mt. Gox itself when it filed for bankruptcy.





Karpeles’s blog has been taken down now but, under the exhortation of the hackers, the data has been mirrored and made available elsewhere for others to see and review, including anonymized user accounts and their balances. Although the hackers claim that no user database dump has been made public, the incident demonstrates how Mt. Gox’s security can be so easily compromised, which is how it ended up in trouble in the first place.VIA: TechCrunch

239	"A Japanese newspaper is reporting that during the spectacular collapse of the Mt Gox Bitcoin exchange, the operation's servers were also suffering a large-scale DDOS attack.The Yomiuri Shimbun's English-language Japan News reports that the attacks in early February reached 150,000 DDOS hits per second, “mostly from servers in the United States and Europe”.Japan News notes that it doesn't require any special skill to launch a DDOS attack, citing Tetsutaro Uehara, a professor of information security at Ritsumeikan University: “DDoS attacks can be done without high-level hacking techniques.”Referring to attacks on Slovenian Bitstamp and Canada's Flexcoin, Uehara said: “It is possible that copycats turned their eyes on other exchanges after weaknesses in Mt. Gox’s system were found.”By February 10, Mt Gox threw its hands up in the air and suspended Bitcoin withdrawals. It later emerged that attackers had found a way to exploit the Mt Gox code to steal 850,000 Bitcoins worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Of the stolen Bitcoins, 750,000 belonged to customers and 100,000 were Mt Gox's own holdings.Mt Gox is under investigation in the US and Japan. ®

	Anonymous hackers have defaced Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ blog and have uploaded a data dump of customer data that, according to users with accounts on the site, is accurate. A Reddit user created an Excel spreadsheet [mirror] of anonymized user accounts with balances, and many current Mt.Gox users have found their balances present.The text of the post reads [NSFW]:The most important number, obviously, is the 951,116.21905382 balance. As you recall, Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy while stating a 850,000 BTC loss. This would suggest Karpeles’ estimates were off by a large margin. Whether all of this is accurate or not is an entirely different manner. What the leak does show us is how easy it was to grab nearly all of Mt.Gox’s user data as well as how hardened Karpeles’ blog was. Furthermore, the files contain the app Mt.Gox admins used to manage transfers. A screenshot appears below.Who hacked Mt.Gox? The leak contains some clues. A visit to the above-mentioned mirror brings a link to the zip file and a note: “I hated working with you.

241	Mt. Gox is a Bitcoin exchange that went bankrupt after getting hit by hackers last month. The hackers stole over $400 million worth of Bitcoin from Mt. Gox. How did they get in?Apparently the hackers hit Mt. Gox with slightly under 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days before the Bitcoins were stolen.Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection last month and was hit by the cyber-attacks around February 7th. according to the Yomiuri Shimbun. Hackers use multiple computers to send floods of requests to commit distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Mt. Gox’s lawyers said that around 750,000 Bitcoins that belonged to customers of the service and another 100,000 of its own were stolen.Bitcoin is created using chains of interactions among a large network of computers around the world. In the first two years of existence, Bitcoin was traded for cents on the dollar. It really started to climb in 2011 and jumped from $40 in late 2012 to $1,100 last year. It has now leveled to between $600 and $700 today.[Source: AFP via BI]	Business
242	"home > archive > 2014 > this articlehome > archive > 2014 > this articlehome > archive > 2014 > this articleMt Gox collapse  shatters Bitcoin myth of virtual moneyBy Peter  Morici
web posted March 10, 2014Bitcoin believers were shaken to their digital souls when  Mt. Gox, the world’s largest exchange, defaulted on $470 million worth of deposits and closed.The virtual currency was supposed to provide a safer, more  private and less costly alternative to money issued by governments, but lacking  the imprimatur of a sovereign is failing.Fundamentally, money provides a secure place to keep your  wealth—you can store your savings for later use at a government guaranteed  bank. And it eliminates the inconvenience of barter—a necessity for even the  most rudimentary market economy. Money permits a nightclub singer to buy bread from a baker  who gets his music from iTunes. All accept dollars, because the U.S. government  declares those to be “legal tender for all debts public and private.”You can do business through barter or some alternative  currency. However, workers, suppliers and landlords expect to be paid in dollars,  and the IRS will require dollars at tax time for income earned through barter.What gives money its value are the goods and services that  may be purchased and taxes paid within the sovereign jurisdiction of the  issuing government.The earliest currencies were coins, often with the face of  the sovereign stamped on gold or silver to instill confidence. Yet, governments  minted coins with non-precious metals, and the Chinese issued paper money more  than two thousand years ago.The creators of Bitcoin and advocates of virtual  currencies are fixated by the temptation of governments to print too much and  destroy its value through inflation.  However, inflation is hardly a  problem in the United States, Europe and Japan, and central banks in other countries  hold dollars, euro and yen to back up their currencies. Bitcoin is created by ordinary folks solving increasingly  difficult mathematical problems defined by the virtual currency’s creator, and  like gold, is naturally limited in supply. It is stored in virtual wallets on  private computers, or deposited at exchanges like Mt. Gox. These function much  like commercial banks but are not guaranteed for safety by the FDIC, Federal  Reserve and similar regulatory agencies around the world. There is no “Bitland” where a government has declared it  legal tender to buy goods and services and pay taxes.  Lacking such a  tangible connection to the real economy, it is very hard to value day-to-day,  never mind next year. Bitcoin traded for $1,117 on December 4, and now commands  only about half that amount. It is no place for your children’s college fund or  retirement savings. Bitcoin is hardly secure. A hacker can steal it from your  digital wallet or an exchange that holds your deposits, just as pirates stole  bank debit and credit card numbers from Target. And the government does not  stand ready to back up Bitcoin exchanges that lose your money or identity to  thieves. A 2013 study found some 45 percent of all Bitcoin  exchanges closed, taking their depositors money with them. Bitcoin is supposed to be more private, because unlike  commercial banks, its exchanges are not monitored by regulators, and its  private payments system charges lower fees than do Visa and MasterCard. However, personal and business transactions can be spied  by hackers or government security agencies through its fairly open payments  system. The government can subpoena your Bitcoin records or those of your  exchange when it needs. Factoring in such risks and potential intrusions, Bitcoin  is a lot less private and more expensive to use than advertised.Detractors of paper money have always been fixated by the  absence of gold to back it up, but they fail to recognize what really makes a  currency accepted and secure—the government guarantee and the good sense of the  sovereign not to abuse its franchise.  It’s not the gold but the face of Caesar—the promise his  image carries—that makes a coin money.

Gox has described as a massive hacker attack that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its users’ bitcoins and left the company bankrupt. Mt. Gox’s staff isn’t talking. So another group of hackers say they’ve broken into the company’s servers to provide answers of their own.On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. “It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be “goxed”–to suffer from Mt. Gox’s technical glitches.Read the full article hereFiled Under: Bitcoin Raymond is a writer, domain trader and consultant based in Pennsylvania.

Donny says March 9, 2014 at 7:45 pmI’ve spent some time reading quite a few of the documents that were made available.  All of them are rather interesting.  It definitely shows that Mt. Gox, still has the Bitcoins.
Donny says March 10, 2014 at 5:55 amIf you do download the files, this is a reminder to NEVER run any .exe file.
HELP.org says March 10, 2014 at 7:38 amMost experienced Bitcoiners got their funds out of Mt. Gox many months ago when US withdrawals stopped.  First rule of Bitcoin investing, never leave funds at an exchange except when making trades.  Maintain offline, cold wallet storage with offsite backups.Before getting involved in Bitcoin you must realize that it is composed of a very strange and complicated underworld and you have to know what is going on if you invest any substantial amount.  Anyone who lost funds with Mt. Gox either did not know what they were doing or were playing a very high risk gamble.TheDomains.com welcomes reader comments.

244	THE extent of hacks on the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange have been revealed, with 150,000 attacks per second before the company went bankrupt, according to reports.Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles filed for bankruptcy after the site suffered heavy attacks by hackers.Source:APBITCOIN exchange MtGox faced a massive hacker offensives last month, coming under 150,000 DDoS attacks a second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report says.The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted losing half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since about February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reports.While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.The collapse of the exchange means around $500 million is missing.Source:APThe attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said on Sunday.MtGox&apos;s lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm&apos;s customers had gone missing, along with about 100,000 units the company owned.Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $US40 a coin in late 2012 and $US1100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

245	"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againHackers claim the data allegedly collected from the exchange's servers shows a disparity in the number of bitcoins deposited versus how many it claims were stolen in a security lapse.Apparently frustrated by a lack of information about how Mt. Gox lost hundreds of millions of dollars in a security lapse, hackers hit the personal blog of Bitcoin exchange's chief executive to level charges of fraud.The Reddit account and personal blog  of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, MagicalTux.net, were hijacked Sunday and defaced with a post that alleged the exchange kept some of the coins allegedly stolen in fraudulent withdrawals. Hackers also posted a 716MB Zip file that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox servers on the sites as well as to Pastebin.The data dump claims that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The embattled exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, saying that Mt. Gox lost nearly 750,000 customer bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.""First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles,"" hackers wrote. ""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed."" The phrase ""getting Goxed"" has become synonymous with the frustration felt by many Mt. Gox investors, who have suffered frequent outages, delayed trading, and suspended withdrawals.""Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data,"" the hackers wrote their profanity-laced diatribe. ""No user database dumps have been included.""CNET could not independently confirm the veracity of the claims, but some Reddit users said they were able to confirm that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, which was posted in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.CNET has contacted Mt. Gox for comment and will update this report when we learn more.At its height, Mt. Gox was one of the largest and most popular Bitcoin exchanges. However, the troubled exchange suspended customer withdrawals on February 7, claiming a fundamental flaw existed in Bitcoin that affected all transactions. Mt. Gox later apologized for the issue and said it had developed a workaround that would allow it to resume service, but that has not yet happened.Due to the currency's encryption technology, it might be difficult, if not impossible, for the stolen bitcoins to be restored to their owners' accounts, leaving people across the globe with significant losses.Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic.  We'll remove comments that violate our policy.Please read our Comment Policy before commenting."	Business

Following the MtGox Bitcoin exchange losing millions to a hack and filing for bankruptcy, anonymous attackers took over the personal blog and reddit account of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday. After seizing control, the hackers posted (Pastebin) a message to the two spaces detailing their findings and the reasoning behind the attack. Further ReadingHaving lost $468 million in bitcoins, MtGox files for bankruptcy protection""It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities [sic] wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,"" the message reads. ""This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data... Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.""Forbes reports the 716 megabyte file placed on Karpeles' site included items like his home address, CV, and an Excel spreadsheet that seems to document more than a million trades. But the most interesting piece of information shared is a summary of 18 different currency balances—with 951,116 bitcoins listed. In light of the 850,000 bitcoins supposedly lost in the recent attack, the hackers concluded this figure demonstrates fraud. The footnote reads, ""That fat fuck has been lying!!""Despite the hack making noise around the Internet today, this leak is not yet guaranteed evidence of foul play. As Forbes notes, the balances could be a case of awful bookkeeping (it's not too far-fetched that MtGox was unaware of the hack for a while), and Karpeles has yet to return that site's request for comment.You must login or create an account to comment."

A poster alerting customers that the digital currency Bitcoin is accepted as payment sits behind the counter inside a cafe in London. Bitcoin attracted media attention last week when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for the digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection after coins valued at more than $500 million went missing.
ASSOCIATED PRESS
Future generations of Bitcoin billionaires may someday look back on 2014 with knowing smiles. Here was a year when thefts spread, exchanges collapsed, rates gyrated like a teenager's moods. And yet the buying of bitcoins showed no signs of abating.The past week was particularly extreme. The suicide of an American business executive in Singapore was investigated for possible ties to her Bitcoin investments. A California man fingered as the currency's mysterious inventor reacted to his sudden fame by asking that journalists buy him lunch. After finishing his meal at a sushi restaurant, he went on to deny any role whatsoever in Bitcoin.Perhaps the most surprising development was that the virtual currency, despite wild fluctuations in value, continued to weather the mayhem. As the humans involved in the adventure looked increasingly vulnerable, Bitcoin looked comparatively solid, trading nearly 10 percent higher Saturday than a week before. Each bitcoin is worth more than $600 in recent trading.""Bitcoin works really well,"" said Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer who is working to develop a different virtual currency. ""All this craziness around Bitcoin isn't around Bitcoin itself. It's around the people.""Bitcoin, first issued in 2009, has gradually gained acceptance as a digital currency that, unlike dollars or euros, can move through the global trade system with low fees, relative privacy and no regulation. That has helped it flourish among technology enthusiasts and libertarians, as well as on marketplaces for illicit drugs and weapons.""It's completely Wild West,"" said Garth Bruen, a security fellow at the Digital Citizens Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that combats online crime. ""There are a lot of people getting rich, and there are a lot of people stealing.""Bitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that the currency has proved resistant to tampering. The total number in circulation can never go beyond a set amount, and each bitcoin is protected by a distinct cryptographic code. If that code is lost, as has sometimes happened, the bitcoin disappears forever.But criminals have targeted the computers that store bitcoins in encrypted code, in depositories known as ""hot wallets."" Over the past two weeks, it has become clear they have succeeded spectacularly in breaking those systems.The most famous example is Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy Feb. 28. It started as a site to trade cards for a popular game but shifted very profitably to Bitcoin, at one point becoming the biggest site for buying the virtual currency.Mt. Gox relied on technology that experts consider easy to use but hard to secure against hackers. When the exchange declared bankruptcy, it reported having lost more $400 million from theft.""The [Bitcoin] system and protocol itself was and is still sound,"" Dustin Trammell, a Bitcoin investor and security expert, said in an email exchange after the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. ""The currency exchange rate is holding stable during the fallout, and it really goes to articulate that Mt. Gox was simply a single bad actor, whether it be intentionally or just incompetence, in an otherwise solid fledgling financial industry.""Flexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Canada, followed with its own bankruptcy this past week, again reportedly because of losses to hackers. Criminals apparently relied on an old trick -- once popular against ATMs -- of trying to withdrawal money faster than a bank can rectify accounts, allowing what amounts to a double-dipping of available funds.Hobbyists and speculators built the first generation of systems for storing and exchanging Bitcoin, despite having little of the expertise need to run financial institutions, Green said. ""Look at it like somebody built a skyscraper out of wood,"" he said. ""That's what happened.""Amid the bankruptcies, news reports said that the suicide of a 28-year-old American woman in Singapore may have been related to her job as chief executive of a company that traded virtual currencies, and to her personal investment in bitcoins.The currency was created by a man who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto. Though the name was long thought to be a pseudonym, a Newsweek reporter found the California home of a Japanese American computer engineer who once went by that name before changing it several years ago.Presented with evidence that he was the Bitcoin inventor, the man appeared to confirm the discovery in an article posted online Thursday. But he recanted -- after asking for lunch -- when a mob of journalists appeared at his home. Newsweek has said it is standing by its story, which included other evidence and interviews with several of the man's relatives.Rising interest in Bitcoin has brought a flood of investments from venture capitalists, allowing for the development of exchanges that, experts say, are more likely to survive the attacks of hackers and other threats to the currency's stability. The number of merchants accepting bitcoins, meanwhile, has steadily grown, and several cities now have ATMs that trade in them, making exchanges easier.Bitcoins are traded directly between individuals, without a bank to act as an intermediary. The transactions are recorded on a Web-based public ledger, called a ""block chain,"" that provides a measure of transparency but also allows governments and others to potentially analyze transfers to determine who owns bitcoins and how they are being used. The exchanges are required by laws in the countries where they operate to record who buys bitcoins.The block chain is scrutinized so carefully that it may be difficult for those who have stolen bitcoins to trade them without being discovered. Experts say it also would be impossible for Nakamoto, the inventor, to cash in any of his personal trove of bitcoins -- rumored to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- without finally and definitively revealing his identity.

											Scott Campbell9:06PM GMT 09 Mar 2014 Troubled Bitcoin exchange MtGox was reportedly attacked 150,000 times per second by hackers in the days leading up to its collapse last month.  The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February, was hit with crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.  During DDoS attacks, hackers take control of multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, causing servers to crash and making websites unavailable.  Lawyers for MtGox said that during the attacks, which lasted for several days, 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers were stolen, worth an estimated $575m (£344m).  Unlike traditional currencies, which are backed by central banks, Bitcoin is created by complex interactions between a large network of computers across the globe.

 Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, said that it has no control over virtual currencies which are not backed by any central authorities. Several countries, such as Russia and China, have placed heavy restrictions on how Bitcoin can be used.  MtGox was founded in 2010 by programmer Jed McCaleb, who sold the company to Tibanne Co. in March 2011. It became the world’s largest marketplace for Bitcoins, handling an estimated 80pc of all transactions of the digital currency.  Last week, more than 400 people signalled that they would join a class action lawsuit against MtGox, according to British law firm Selachii.  It is the latest effort to try to reclaim some of the hundreds of thousands of lost Bitcoins from the exchange.  Richard Howlett, co-founder of Selachii, said: “On the back of the MtGox collapse, a lot of people say they feel the truth is not being stated.”  Mark Karpeles, chief executive of MtGox, apologised for the collapse at a news conference earlier this month, blaming a “weakness in our system”, but predicted that the market will grow.

Gox has described as a massive hacker attack that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its users' bitcoins and left the company bankrupt. Mt. Gox's staff isn't talking. So another group of hackers say they've broken into the company's servers to provide answers of their own.On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt.

""It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,"" wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be ""goxed""--to suffer from Mt. Gox's technical glitches.The hackers also posted a 716 megabyte file to Karpeles' personal website that they said comprised stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers. It appears to include an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, a file that purports to show the company's balances in eighteen difference currencies, the backoffice application for some sort of administrative access to the databases of Mt. Gox's parent company Tibanne Limited, a screenshot of the hackers' access to those databases, a list of Mark Karpeles' home addresses and Karpeles' personal CV.A screenshot posted by Mt. Gox's hackers, seeming to show administrative access to the company's database of trades.
Update: Users on Reddit are warning that the hackers’ files may contain malware designed to steal bitcoins. Other Reddit users have confirmed that they found their own account history in the data, indicating that it’s not fake. But for security reasons, I don’t recommend anyone download the collection of hacked files.In the hackers' summary of Mt. Gox's balances in various currencies, they point to a claimed balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which they take as evidence that Mark Karpeles' claim to have lost users' digital currency to hackers is fraudulent. ""That fat fuck has been lying!!"" a note in the file reads.I've reached out to Karpeles for comment, but haven't yet heard back from him. Mt. Gox's embattled chief executive has remained almost entirely mum as his company has imploded over the last weeks.In a possibly related incident, a user on the BitcoinTalk forum posted a message--since deleted by the forum's moderators--claiming to be offering for sale a 20 gigabyte stolen database from Mt. Gox, including the personal details of all its users and even scans of their passports. ""This document will never be elsewhere published by us,"" wrote the user, who went by the name nanashi____. ""Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure."" The hacker asked for a price of 100 bitcoins for the database, about $63,600 at current exchange rates. 'I've reached out to nanashi____ via an email address he or she provided, and I'll update this post if I hear back.I couldn't verify that Sunday's database dump was real, or that it showed any of the ""lying"" that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox's accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins--that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.But as Bitcoin experts pore over the hacked files, they may yet offer clues to the mystery around Mt. Gox's fate. The Bitcoin community has been puzzled by the apparent lack of movement of Mt. Gox's bitcoins since the company declared bankruptcy last month. Despite stating that it lost 850,000 bitcoins in total in its bankruptcy filing, Bitcoin experts haven't seen the movement of those coins in the Bitcoin blockchain, the public ledger of transactions that prevents fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy.Moderators on the Bitcoin subforum on Reddit deleted the hackers' post a few hours after it first appeared, stating that posting stolen content violated the forum's etiquette rules. But users on the forum didn't hesitate to draw their own conclusions: the top post on the forum Sunday afternoon read ""Mt. Gox scam was just exposed -- MK [Mark Karpeles] officially stole our funds.""""We've been goxed!"" it added.With reporting contributed by Kashmir Hill.–Follow me on Twitter , email me, anonymously send me sensitive documents or tips , and check out the new paperback edition of my book, This Machine Kills Secrets: Julian Assange, the Cypherpunks, and Their Fight to Empower Whistleblowers."

Regulators in various countries are grappling with bitcoin. What the hell is it? It's a good question and answers vary widely.

Bloomberg reports Japan Says Bitcoin Not Currency Amid Calls for Regulation.

The answer to my question is yes, no, don't know, and it depends (dependent on what country you are in).

Newsweek Unmasks Bitcoin Inventor

Two day ago, Newsweek unmasked Satoshi Nakamoto, The Face Behind Bitcoin. It's a fascinating article, and one well worth a look.

Here's a paragraph that caught my attention.

Denial, Bizarre Media Road Chase 

The Guardian reports Satoshi Nakamoto: man denies being bitcoin inventor amid media frenzy.

Followup Statement 

Newsweek issued a followup statement in regards to the denials ... ""Newsweek stands strongly behind Ms. Goodman and her article. Ms. Goodman’s reporting was motivated by a search for the truth surrounding a major business story, absent any other agenda. The facts as reported point toward Mr. Nakamoto’s role in the founding of Bitcoin.""

I believe Newsweek has it correct. Leah McGrath Goodman did a fantsatic job of investigative reporting.

Updated: January 27, 2018 @ 11:54 amWASHINGTON — I was talking to someone about Bitcoin and mistakenly called it “Bitcon.”“Oh, what a Freudian slip,” the person said.I wasn’t trying to comment about the legitimacy of the digital currency. Bitcoins can be used to buy products and services. You can also invest in them.The value of a bitcoin isn’t based on a currency you know such as the dollar or euro. But you buy bitcoins by transferring real money to a person or an exchange. It’s basically lines of computer code that become online cash. Bitcoins can be stored on a person’s computer or held by a third party in a virtual wallet. Their value can rise or fall substantially and quickly.Regulators across the country are warning investors about the volatility of Bitcoin both as a currency and investment. I hope their warnings will be taken seriously, particularly in light of the recent events surrounding one of the major Bitcoin exchanges. With no initial explanation, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox left customers unable to access their Bitcoin accounts. In a tersely written message on its website, www.mtgox.com, the company said the move was to “protect the site and our users.” A subsequent note — three sentences long — from the company’s chief executive also didn’t shed light on what’s happened to the company or the bitcoins it held for customers, only that it has had “recent issues.”The company has since filed for bankruptcy protection saying technical issues resulted in fraudulent withdrawals and as a result it has lost 850,000 bitcoins, including 100,000 of its own, worth more than $400 million.Throughout the shutdown, Mt. Gox hasn’t been upfront with its customers. And therein lies the problem. The company didn’t have to answer to any authority or regulator, so it didn’t have to tell folks what was happening with their money.In fact, digital currency made the North American Securities Administrators Association’s list of new investor threats. “The value of bitcoins and other digital currencies is highly volatile and the concept behind the currency is difficult to understand even for sophisticated financial experts,” NASAA said in its alert.Says association spokesman Bob Webster, “state securities regulators are concerned that the popularity of digital currency can provide con artists with fertile soil to grow a new generation of scams. Investors need to be aware that investments based on virtual money present real risks, including the possibility of being bitconned.”Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., sent a letter to federal regulators calling for a ban on bitcoins because they are unregulated and, in some famous instances, have been tied to illegal activity.In a recent warning to investors, Joseph Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission said, “The risk of using Bitcoin may be off the charts! When using Bitcoin for investing, it is difficult to seek any protection or recourse for losses due to fraudulent schemes.” Echoing other regulators, here’s a rundown of Borg’s specific concerns with Bitcoin:Joe Rotunda, director of the enforcement division for the Texas State Securities Board and a member of NASAA’s enforcement section, is the association’s point person on Bitcoin. He’s concerned that some people, hoping to strike it rich by investing in the next big technological advance, will overlook the risk in this new payment form.Consider its volatility. Rotunda points out that a bitcoin was valued at less than $14 in January 2013 and jumped to $1,200 in November 2013. Most recently it dropped to about $400 following the news about Mt. Gox.“My biggest concern about Bitcoin is that it’s trendy and there’s a lot of buzz about it,” he said in an interview. “But you can’t get caught up in the buzz and trendiness of it and lose sight of the inherent risk. This is the type of risk that can wipe out someone’s retirement account in a matter of minutes. That’s the flip side of this coin.”There are some benefits to digital currency. It could reduce the cost of financial transactions, especially from country to country. It could give people living in areas without financial institutions or stable currency a safer way to transact business.Perhaps with more protections, Bitcoin or some other digital currency could take off and provide handsome returns. But right now, it’s too risky for most investors.Michelle Singletary is a personal finance columnist for The Washington Post. Her column runs on Sunday.	Business
262	"Britain’s first machine for dispensing digital currency opened for business in a cafe near London’s “Silicon roundabout” tech hub in east London on Friday, offering customers the ability to exchange bank notes for bitcoins.Nick Letchford, managing director of the group that owns the Old Shoreditch Station cafe, decided to install the machine after noticing the popularity of bitcoins among his customers working nearby in the digital industries.“It gets used regularly based on where we are located,” he said. “There are lots of technology-orientated consumers within our area, and it caters very easily for them,” he said.“Currently people are buying coffees and beers with bitcoins, mostly beers actually,” Letchford added.He sees a mainstream future for the virtual currency, even though the top bitcoin exchange has collapsed and the currency has been volatile due to speculation as well as prone to criminal activities.At the beginning of March, the Tokyo-based company Mt. Gox, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, declared bankruptcy saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.In 2012, a leaked FBI report said the virtual currency was an “increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities beyond the cyber realm”.Bitcoin, which has been growing in popularity, relies on a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction.The currency came into existence in 2009, with the value negotiated by individuals chatting on bitcoin forums. The whistle-blowing site Wikileaks and other organisations began to accept the currency for donations, and by the end of 2012 some 1,000 organisations had followed suit.Customers who use the machine in East London are charged an 8 percent commission, and each customer is limited to 1,000 pounds ($1,700) in transactions per month.“I think it is very much a burgeoning thing,” Letchford said. It’s not mainstream in any way, but I think from a vendor’s perspective it is so straightforward and simple. There is a future in it as it becomes embraced by the mainstream.”More than 50,000 deaths are expected before it finally ends.

    A week after the collapse of Mt.Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered – or more often, not covered – by existing law.The issue took on new prominence in Japan on February 28, when Mt.Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, “we have not grasped the situation in its entirety.""The authorities are monitoring the Mt.Gox bankruptcy process and, if necessary, will consider a response, said chief cabinet secretary 
 
  Yoshihide Suga
 .Fewer than 1 per cent of Mt.Gox’s 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin.“It’s not money,"" said Finance Minister 
 
  Taro Aso
 . “Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?"" he asked at a regular news conference. “Opinions are divided.""The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction.But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this.Regarding money laundering, certain transactions – whether with bitcoin or not – require people to identify themselves, it notes.The six-page document is the government’s official response to questions posed by 
 
  Tsutomu Okubo
 , a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.

266	Those of you fortunate enough to live near London's Tech City can get your hands on some Bitcoin more easily than ever before, thanks to a newly-installed Bitcoin cash machine. It's in good company, joining Seattle and Austin, which were the first cities to host pop-up Bitcoin ATMs last month.The cash machine can be found inside the Old Shoreditch Cafe and Bar, and lets people top-up their Bitcoin wallets easily by scanning the QR code from their Bitcoin wallet, where they can insert up to £1,000 in cash, and bam! Instant Bitcoin. Sadly it doesn't work the other way around, as the cafe's owner, Joel Raziel, has decided against letting people use the machine to swap their Bitcoins for real cash.The machine has apparently been a big success, with one nutter man coming all the way from Manchester for the chance to use the machine. Raziel hopes that the machine will catch on in other parts of the country, and it's probably not the worst thing that Shoreditch can offer the world, all things considered. But with Bitcoin's mysterious founder being outed, Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsing, and the Winklevoss twins using it to pay Richard Branson for a galactic flight (virtually killing it with their uncoolness), we're not too confident this ATM will last past summer.

270	Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga gestures during a press conference at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo on March 7, 2014. (AFP Photo/Yoshikazu Tsuno) Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga gestures during a press conference at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo on March 7, 2014. (AFP Photo/Yoshikazu Tsuno) Tokyo. Japan’s government said Bitcoin isn’t a currency amid calls for its regulation a week after the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that was once the world’s biggest.There is no law to define Bitcoin and relevant ministries are gathering information on it, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet said in a statement in response to questions from an opposition party lawmaker. Bitcoin transactions can be taxed, according to the statement obtained by Bloomberg News.Japan isn’t the only country grappling with the regulation of Bitcoin amid reports of hacking into exchanges including Mt. Gox and concern that the virtual currency can be used for money laundering. In the US, states are wrestling with how digital-currency businesses could be regulated as money transmitters, while Russia has said Bitcoin is illegal under current law and Finland plans to treat it as a commodity.The Japanese banking law doesn’t allow lenders to broker Bitcoin transactions or set up accounts for customers to store the digital assets, according to the statement. At the same time, current rules don’t prevent brokerages and asset managers from managing clients’ Bitcoins, it said.“Japan’s government is falling behind the curve as Bitcoin grew rapidly over the past five years,” said Weizhou Yang, an analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “Banks shouldn’t take risks to dabble in Bitcoin business. On the other hand, getting Bitcoin into funds may broaden the investment product base.”DPJ’s Okubo Democratic Party of Japan lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo, a former vice finance minister, called on the government to rectify the lack of regulation last week. Officials from the Finance Ministry, Financial Services Agency and Bank of Japan have said they’re not in a position to oversee Bitcoin.“The authorities’ stance that they don’t have responsibility is disgraceful,” Okubo, who also used to work at Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview on Feb. 26. “We need to establish a legal system.”Finance Minister Taro Aso said today that the government hasn’t decided whether to regulate Bitcoin. Earlier this week Aso, who also oversees the banking regulator, said it wasn’t clear yet whether Mt. Gox’s failure was a crime.Hacker theft Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 28, saying 850,000 Bitcoins were missing and may have been stolen by hackers. The coins are valued at more than $550 million, based on an index of current prices compiled by Coindesk. Fewer than 1 percent of its creditors are from Japan, the exchange’s lawyers said.Flexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Alberta, Canada, was forced to shut down this week after hackers stole 896 units of the digital currency, the Guardian newspaper reported March 5.Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and has no central issuing authority. Dorian S. Nakamoto, a physicist identified by Newsweek magazine as the creator, yesterday denied involvement in the digital currency before leading reporters on a multi-vehicle car chase and entering an Associated Press bureau.Singapore’s finance minister said last month that the central bank didn’t recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. China has stopped financial institutions from dealing in it, even as trading continues. Danish regulators are drafting a proposal for lawmakers in an effort to protect consumers and businesses from losses.Bloomberg	Business

272	"Some say it's the money of the future, and it's starting to pop up around Southwest Florida. We're talking about Bitcoin – a digital currency that can be used all around the world. In a smart phone world, it's a way to purchase goods in an instant. ""Bitcoin allows you to be your own banker,"" said Butterfly Estates owner Rob Johnson. You can use Bitcoin to buy real stuff without financial establishments.  But there's no Federal Reserve to back you up if it fails.""Right now, we really don't know how much the government is printing in money every single day.  They can print as much money as they want, and you and I have no idea what that amount is,"" said Johnson. With Bitcoin, only $21 million will ever be made.  It's a concept that's starting to gain tractions. ""I know it's on-line, but I don't know much else about it.  I didn't know it was in Fort Myers,"" said Fort Myers resident Sandy Toney. Johnson uses Bitcoin at the Butterfly Estates and ZCrepes Café.  He's one of about a dozen Southwest Florida businesses that accept Bitcoin as payment. ""Using it at my restaurant for instance is a great benefit for me because I'm a business owner – but I don't have to pay some of the surcharges that you have to pay with credit cards,"" said Johnson. If you wanted to pay for a crepe with Bitcoin, all you have to do is open up the app on your phone, enter the amount in U.S. dollar amount and it automatically converts it into Bitcoin money.  Once you open up the QR code, scan it and your bill is paid. ""The problem is that you look at what the price of Bitcoin has done since it was first introduce and it has been very volatile,"" said Wells Fargo financial advisor Nick Chlumsky. Right now, one Bitcoin is worth about $630.  One year ago, it was as low as $50.  But that's not the only issue. ""There's a lot of implications for not only how you track the currency and how local governments and municipalities can collect taxes on the expenditures that are being made with Bitcoin,"" said Chlumsky. So, how do you get them? You can buy the Bitcoins on-line or use specialized computers and software to ""mine"" for it.  Mining involves the computer solving puzzles to earn currency that already exists from collected transactions fees and newly minted Bitcoins.

275	"CKGSB KnowledgeChina-focused leadership and business analysisMarch 5, 2014 By Bennett Voyles Bitcoin has spurred interest in virtual currencies, which have the ability to revolutionize our world. But governments and regulators will have the last word on bitcoin’s future prospects.After a year of wild price swings–from $13.50 per coin in January 2013 to $1,242 in November and now back to around $500–and the recent closure of Mt. Gox in Japan, until recently bitcoin’s largest exchange, the bitcoin currency system looks far too volatile to become a universal currency any time soon. However, some economists and venture capitalists believe that a digital monetary system has enough practical advantages that sooner or later, your money may be even more virtual than it is now. What is the future of bitcoin?Invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of an unknown cryptographer, bitcoin is an ingenious peer-to-peer payment system that enables people to make transactions without any recourse to a government-issued currency.But like the ones and zeros that make up the binary language of the digital world, the views of what that future might look like tend to run toward extremes. On the con side, science fiction writer and economic blogger Charles Stross imagines that a bitcoin economy would starve government services by reducing government’s ability to tax, make it easier to trade all kinds of illegal things, and in the end, make “a sub-Saharan kleptocracy look like a socialist utopia”.Bitcoin boosters, on the other hand, see it as a key technology in building a more prosperous world in which capital moves with less friction, individuals are completely free to make their own economic choices, and money is no longer a government monopoly. As one bitcoin site puts it, “No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.”If the advantages and the disadvantages sound quite similar, that’s no accident. Many of bitcoin’s most committed supporters have a Libertarian bent, and argue that apart from a few limited functions, the world could be run better if people were left largely to their own devices.A world dominated by a digital, non-state currency, would be “a world of strong privacy,” says David D. Friedman, a law professor at Santa Clara University in California and son of the late free market economist Milton Friedman.Strong privacy would share many of the characteristics of the old Swiss bank system that enabled people to hold assets anonymously–a good thing say, if you’re trying to escape from the Nazis, but not so good if you’re a citizen in a developing country trying to find your country’s vanished oil revenues.Taxation would be more difficult in a world of strong privacy. “It’s really hard to tax something you can’t see,” Friedman says. It would also be a lot more difficult to watch what people are doing.One possible preview of the dark side of that future came in November, when the US Justice Department disclosed the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht, the alleged founder of Silk Road, a kind of underworld eBay, in San Francisco. Prosecutors allege that the secret website had made it possible for people to buy and sell drugs, arms, and a variety of illicit services, all with bitcoins.It would also make it more difficult for governments to clamp down on organizations for ideological reasons. Eli Dourado, a research fellow at the technology policy program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, says a virtual currency would also make it a lot harder for governments stop organizations they don’t like.  Wikileaks, for instance, was starved of funds because the US government made it impossible for people to donate money to the controversial group.Bitcoin could lead to considerable disruption in the financial world as well. For example, bitcoin could be a boon for migrant workers, who now must spend a considerable part of their income simply sending their hard-earned money home. Migrant workers send more than $500 billion home a year, according to World Bank figures, and currently pay high fees on those remittances: a 2010 United Nations report noted that they pay as much as $18 on a $200 transfer by Western Union or the other two leading operators.However, as radical as some of these changes might sound, Dourado argues that people have overlooked even more revolutionary implications of bitcoin. “I think bitcoin is actually a kind of base-layer protocol in the same way that TCP/IP is for the internet,” he says.“Bitcoin is programmable money,” Dourado explains. As a ledger-based system, a bitcoin could be attached to some real property. For example, a single bitcoin might be tied to a title deed, making it possible to buy a car without ever meeting the seller.  Or it might be programmed to perform an if-then statement, he says, making it possible to create Kickstarter-like but entirely decentralized markets.Dourado’s view isn’t unique. Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, has argued in the New York Times that bitcoin is at a similar stage of development to the personal computer in 1975 or the internet in 1993, and represents “a sweeping vista of opportunity”.Andreessen and number of other Silicon Valley venture capitalists are already trying to stake claims in that sweeping vista. In 2013, venture capitalists invested $74 million in 40 bitcoin-related ventures, $50 million of that in the fourth quarter, according to CB Insights, a venture capital data analytics firm.Bigger players may be trying to get in on this virtual gold rush as well. In December, eBay filed a patent application for something that sounds a lot like electronic money and could be sent by one person to another, “a Gift Token… that can be limited to use at a specified store, a specified group of stores, or a specified chain of stores. The token can be limited to use in purchasing a specified product.” Tokens could also be limited geographically, according to the application, to a particular city or region.But whether bitcoin itself is part of that digital monetary future remains to be seen. Enough legal problems have already cropped up that the new currency could end up being the Napster of digital money–the pioneer that paves the way for a more government-friendly alternative. It has been especially difficult for bitcoin in China. 
Government officials in Europe and elsewhere won’t sit back forever if the use of digital money grows, predicts Robert Pargac, Director of Global Investigations and Compliance for Navigant Consulting in New York. Should the value of bitcoins remain volatile, regulators could ultimately classify them as a type of commodity, he says.“If [bitcoin proponents] really want a secretive, anonymous, free-floating market-driven virtual currency that’s not regulated, that’s simply not going to happen,” says Pargac. “It’s not going to be good for the consumer, it won’t be good for the economy and regulators and law enforcement will not permit it. They will find it and they will close it down.”Filed Under: All Articles, Finance, Policy and Law, Technology Tagged With: Bitcoins, Currency, Marc Andreessen, Mt Gox, Slider, Virtual CurrencyInformation, analysis, and interviews about the Chinese economy and doing business in China, from the people who know it best.

276	Japan has become perhaps the world’s most important locale for bitcoin, the digital currency that was supposed to liberate its users from the tyranny of geography—and its government is playing catch-up.This week the creator of bitcoin has been allegedly unmasked as a Japanese-born Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who was “descended from samurai and the son of a buddhist priest,” according to Newsweek. The media circus around Nakamoto, who has denied Newsweek’s claims, comes as the bitcoin world is still reeling from the failure of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which went from being the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange to an ignoble bankruptcy last week.It was the failure of Mt. Gox that finally spurred prime minister Shinzo Abe’s government to issue its first major proclamation about bitcoin on March 7, and it’s fair to say that Japan’s stance is still a work in progress.Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that bitcoin would be treated as a commodity, not as a currency, and “as a matter of common sense” it would be “natural” for the government to tax bitcoin transactions. But the government also said it was still gathering information on bitcoin—including an attempt to determine the total volume and value of bitcoins in circulation. The total number of Japanese bitcoin owners is also not clear.“We are now sorting things out under the current law and mulling what the government can do,” Suga added.Japan’s financial institutions have also been grappling with how to deal with bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mizuho Bank, which handled wire transfers and other business from Mt. Gox, repeatedly asked the exchange to shut down its account (paywall) because of an “unmanageable volume of money transfers,” many of them between Mt. Gox and its international customers.The Japanese government issued a statement earlier this week that it does not prohibit financial firms from investing funds in bitcoin, but they are banned from exchanging between bitcoins and conventional currencies.At least a few Japanese bitcoin owners are still optimistic despite the events of the last few weeks. Keiichi Hida of the Japan Digital Money Association, who lost¥100,000 ($980) when Mt. Gox failed, told Reuters, “We should make it a national project to have bitcoin used nationwide at the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” he said. “I think then everyone would come to Tokyo in an instant.”	Business

Gox has highlighted the problems with virtual currency but the clamour for something like it won’t easily be silenced The virtual currency known as Bitcoin is likely here to stay. Not in its current form, not after its many problems were cast in stark relief by the collapse of Mt. Gox, formerly the world’s largest bitcoin bank. It famously lost all $500 million-plus worth of the Bitcoins its clients had on deposit when hackers attacked its website. The spectacular blowout at the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox on Feb. 28, the site had been plagued for months by abrupt shutdowns and other technical woes, was preceded weeks earlier by the arrest of BitInstant founder Charles Shrem, whose Bitcoin bank is accused of facilitating drug transactions on Silk Road, a notorious and now-defunct Internet black market for illicit drug sales. VIDEOThe nuts and bolts of BitcoinAnd the demise of Mt. Gox has been followed by a robbery, by hackers, of an estimated $600,000 (U.S.) worth of Bitcoins from the Alberta Bitcoin bank Flexcoin. It also came to light this week that Autumn Radtke, 28-year-old CEO of Singapore-based Bitcoin exchange First Meta, had died of “unnatural” causes on the day Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy.Bitcoin, which holds the promise of becoming the world’s first global currency, is for now easily mocked. It is just four years old. It is almost wholly unregulated. It is backed neither by central banks nor national treasuries. And there is no Canada Deposit Insurance Corp. or its equivalent elsewhere to make good on, for instance, the half-billion-dollars worth of Bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox.By April of last year, the number of daily Bitcoin transactions had reached 70,000, remarkable for a currency that debuted in 2009. But the estimated total value of Bitcoin transactions was a mere $2 billion — not even a rounding error in a global economy of $72 trillion.The value of Bitcoins has been hugely volatile, even by the standards of the most volatile commodities. In the first four months of last year, the value of a Bitcoin gyrated wildly, from $13 to $266, before suddenly plunging more than 60 per cent. Yet by November of last year, the Bitcoin’s value had recovered to set a record high of more than $1,200, before stumbling to its current value of $525 or so in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox debacle. Rank speculation is behind that volatility, giving the not-ready-for-prime-time currency a reputation in “proper” circles of “Trading tulips in real time,” the comparison with 18th-century Tulipmania to the Bitcoin phenomenon used by Art Cashin, a veteran broker at the giant Swiss-based traditional bank UBS AG.And yet, and yet. Few merchants price their goods in Bitcoins — how could they, given their volatility? — but a surprisingly large number of online merchants now accept Bitcoins as payment. Such merchants are protected by firms like Utah’s BitPay, which collects the Bitcoins owed to its 4,500 merchants and other clients, and forwards to them conventional cash, taking on itself the risk of Bitcoin value volatility.To be sure, the Bitcoin exists in the same cultish ethos as gold, whose most zealous adulators believe today’s “fiat” money, as they deride the stuff printed and backed by governments, could become worthless by government whim. Mind you, it’s the same rapture felt by the early evangelists of the PC and later the Internet, who turned out to be so close to the mark in their forecasts that this new century is defined as the Information Age.Bitcoins have so far existed at the margins of mainstream economics. And so it hasn’t been readily apparent, as perhaps it should be, that some form of global economic currency is the inevitable next step in a globally interconnected financial system in which millions of transactions and trillions of dollars each day have long taken place in pixels, not cash. Electronic banking as a Main Street reality made its advent about a decade ago and e-commerce has followed, adopted by an increasing number of vendors as varied as florists, apparel merchants and car dealerships. Why not an electronic currency, recognized worldwide, to fill out what’s already an overwhelmingly electronic financial world?The early champions of Bitcoin are a diverse group. They include the major institutional investor Fortress Investment Group, which manages $62 billion in conventional investments; venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, a heavy investor in Bitcoin-related startups who is still best-known for having helped pioneer Netscape, the first reliable Internet browser; and the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, Bitcoin venture investors last seen being outfoxed by Mark Zuckerberg in the Facebook docudrama  The Social Network.A motley crew, possibly. But also arguing in Bitcoin’s defence is Robert Shiller. The Yale economist was among the few to predict the dot-com collapse in the late 1990s, and among the fewer still to warn of the unprecedented U.S. housing collapse that triggered the Great Recession.“Something good can arise from [Bitcoin’s] innovations — even if the results are very different from its current form,” Shiller wrote in a New York Times essay on the heels of the Mt. Gox implosion, when there were obvious doubts about the nascent currency’s future. “Electronic forms of money could give us better pricing, contracting and risk management.” To this point, the Bitcoin has had a Wild West feel to it. But regulators in Europe, Japan and the U.S. are moving quickly in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox collapse to rein in Bitcoin trading, requiring Bitcoin banks and trading houses to make detailed records of trades and report high-value transactions just as conventional financial institutions are required to do. The improvements in financial-transaction activity that Bitcoin has identified are undeniably attractive. You can access your Bitcoin account with your 12-character password using your smartphone or other computing device from anywhere on the planet at any time of day. And there are no transaction costs. Commercial banks make most of their profits from transaction fees — you’ve likely noticed it can cost you $21.50 to withdraw $20 from an ATM. It’s estimated that payments and other banking transactions will generate $1.1 trillion a year in a decade’s time, about double the current amount. That’s a lot of honey to attract techies who can design a new payments system that strips out the speculators and standardizes payments across today’s multitude of national currencies.Indeed, the durability of peer-to-peer Internet sharing of music and movies is a comparison often made to the inevitability of electronic currency that removes the middleman and his cut. Cameron Winklevoss claims that “To shut down Bitcoin, you’d have to shut down the Internet.”Well, no. But if a means can be perfected of curbing the proliferation of banking fees, one would have some difficulty silencing the clamour for that kind of progress.

280	" Mark Karpeles, chief executive officer of Mt Gox (centre) attends a news  conference at the Tokyo District Court. The world’s largest Bitcoin  exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan, focusing attention on the  digital currency’s risks.
Reuters/Tokyo
A week after the collapse of Mt. Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.
In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered – or more often, not covered – by existing law.
The issue took on new prominence in Japan on February 28, when Mt. Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.
Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, “we have not grasped the situation in its entirety.”
The authorities are monitoring the Mt. Gox bankruptcy process and, if necessary, will consider a response, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
Fewer than 1% of Mt. Gox’s 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin.
“It’s not money,” said finance minister Taro Aso. “Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?” he asked at a regular news conference. “Opinions are divided.”
The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction.
But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this.
Regarding money laundering, certain transactions – whether with bitcoin or not – require people to identify themselves, it notes. The 6-page document is the government’s official response to questions posed by Tsutomu Okubo, a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.

He had worked with the railroad for eight years.He was working with a crew assigned to restoring power to track that had been closed for the weekend.The employee was doing work on the tracks when he was struck by a train en-route to Poughkeepsie.The railroad says he was struck at 12:54 a.m. by the 12:47 a.m. train en route to Poughkeepsie, on its regular schedule. Why the crew was along this certain section of track is being investigated.Senator Charles Schumer held a press conference at Grand Central Terminal to question the safety improvements the MTA has put in place.Senator Schumer said he did not think a federal take over of the railroad is an option to discuss now.The NTSB and the FRA are investigating the incident along with Metro-North and the MTA Police Department.“The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff’s family,” said Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti.“Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad. With our partners at the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, we will re-examine our procedures and protocols to ensure we are performing our jobs with safety as the paramount concern.”Filed in: News

   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. - A Metro-North worker from Yonkers was killed Monday after being struck by a train on the Harlem line, according to a report in the

	A Metro-North track worker who apparently strayed beyond a protected work zone was struck and killed by a northbound train in upper Manhattan early Monday.
	James Romansoff, 58, of Yonkers, was hit on an elevated stretch of track at 106th St. and Park Ave., the latest in a spate of serious accidents on the commuter railroad, officials said.
	One source said that Romansoff was part of a crew that wrongly believed train traffic was suspended in the area they entered.
	“There was some sort of miscommunication,” the source said.
	Romansoff, an eight-year employee in Metro-North's Power Department, was part of a crew restoring power to tracks that had been closed for weekend maintenance work, the MTA said in a statement.
	Two other sources said a safe work zone had been created by dispatchers remotely blocking trains from entering the area. The zone, however, was established south of where Romansoff was hit, the two sources said.
	The northbound train left Grand Central at 12:47 a.m. en route to Poughkeepsie and struck Romansoff at 12:54 a.m., officials said. He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
	A team of National Transportation Safety Board experts is investigating the accident along with the Federal Railway Administration.
	In addition to Romansoff, the crew was made up of two other electrical workers and a supervisor. The train’s engineer sounded his horn and hit the emergency brakes when he unexpectedly came upon the crew but couldn't stop in time, sources said.
	Romansoff, who was divorced, is survived by a 26-year-old daughter and a sister, a source said.
	The fatality was particularly shocking because it comes as Metro-North is under increased federal scrutiny after accidents that left four passengers and a railroad foreman dead. The FRA has had staffers on the railroad poring over safety practices and procedures for nearly two months. Metro-North has conducted refresher training for thousands of workers and has installed new equipment to ensure engineers don't exceed speed limits on curves.
	Robert Luden, 52, a Metro-North track foreman in Connecticut, was killed by a train on the New Haven line in May. A trainee in a rail control tower opened up a track segment for train service without alerting the foreman or other workers doing a construction project in West Haven.
	Also in May, a New Haven line train derailed after going over a piece of faulty rail and was struck by another train on the adjacent track.
	Then in December, an out-of-control speeding train derailed near the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx after the engineer reportedly nodded off. Four passengers were killed and more than 70 were injured.
	“The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff's family,"" said Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti. “Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad. With our partners at the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, we will re-examine our procedures and protocols to ensure we are performing our jobs with safety as the paramount concern.""
	The last Metro-North worker killed on the job before Luden was Kenneth McGrath, who was hit by a Metro-North train near Rye in 2009, the authority said.

   FAIRFIELD COUNTY, Conn. - A Metro-North worker was killed early Monday after being struck by a train on the Harlem Line in New York City, according to a report in the New York Daily News.
  
   The worker was working on the elevated tracks along Park Avenue at East 106th Street when he was struck, the paper reported.
  
   The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation into the accident, with a team of three investigators en route to New York City, it announced via Twitter.
  
   The Hudson Line train departed Grand Central Terminal at 12:47 a.m. en route to Poughkeepsie, the paper reported.
  
   “I send my condolences to the friends, family, and colleagues of the Metro North worker killed early this morning as he repaired a track in East Harlem,"" said U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. ""The safety problems at Metro North are a matter of life and death, for both passengers and employees, and the culture that allows these frequent mistakes cannot continue.  I spent my morning meeting with commuters at the train station. They are frustrated and worried. I am eager to see Metro North’s new leadership bring the change necessary to make this essential transportation system safe and reliable.”

The employee, identified as James Romansoff, 58, of Yonkers, was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.About 50 passengers were on board the train, the 12:47 a.m. from Grand Central Terminal bound for Poughkeepsie. The passengers were placed on another train and resumed their trip at 2:17 a.m.The accident caused disruptions for about two hours.The incident is being investigated by Metro-North and MTA police. But preliminary findings indicate Romansoff went beyond a protected work zone while restoring power to the section of the track, 1010 WINS’ Al Jones reported.The National Transportation Safety Board is also looking into the incident, WCBS 880’s Peter Haskell reported.“I was shocked and very dismayed to hear about this, it’s a horrible, tragic situation,” Arthur Davidson, general chairman of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers System Council 7, told 1010 WINS.Sen. Charles Schumer, speaking to reporters at Grand Central Terminal on Monday, said there has been a disturbing pattern with Metro-North.Last May, a track foreman was killed in West Haven. Conn., and in December, four people were killed when a train derailed in the Bronx.“Collisions, power failures, derailments, injuries and even deaths,” said Schumer, D-N.Y.“Something is wrong in the culture of safety.”As of March 1, a new safety protocol designed to prevent such fatal incidents went into effect.The Enhanced Employee Protection System prevents dispatchers from sending trains through when employees are working on the tracks until a specific code is received.“We believe it will set a new standard for the railroad industry,” spokeswoman Marjorie Anders told The Journal News before the system went into effect.The EEP system “takes the human error out of the equation,” Anthony Bottalico with the Association of Commuter Rail Employees told The Journal News.Asked if the new safety protocols were being followed in Monday’s accident, an MTA spokesperson told Haskell that Metro-North does follow its procedures.The union represents 1,700 Metro-North employees.Check Out These Other Stories From CBSNewYork.com:

307	"Metro-North Worker Struck, Killed by Train in East Harlem: MTA Link to this video  Embed this video Replay More videos (1 of 9)A veteran Metro-North worker was struck and killed by a train in East Harlem early Monday, the latest in a series of accidents at the beleaguered commuter railroad.The employee, 58-year-old James Romansoff, was working on the tracks near East 106th Street and Park Avenue when he was hit by a Poughkeepsie-bound Hudson Line train that left Grand Central Terminal at 12:47 a.m., a Metro-North spokesman said.The Yonkers man had spent eight years with the railroad's power department, and was part of a crew restoring power to tracks that had been closed for weekend maintenance work when he was hit.Service was suspended while emergency crews worked, and the three dozen passengers on the train that hit the worker were transferred to another train. Service was restored before the morning rush. ""The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff's family,"" Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti said in a statement. Metro-North authorities and MTA police are investigating, along with the National Transportation Safety Board.Metro-North has been plagued with problems over the past year, including the death of a worker on the tracks in West Haven, Conn. last spring. In that case, the worker was hit by a train on a supposedly inactive section of track.Also last spring, two trains collided during the evening rush in Connecticut, injuring more than 60 people.And in December, a speeding train derailed in the Bronx, killing four people and injuring dozens more.

308	If the billionaire Koch brothers are trying to “buy our democracy,” as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., put it, what is Democrat donor William Ackman buying?The billionaire hedge fund manager has conspired with members of Congress and outside groups to destroy Herbalife, a nutrition products company, according to the New York Times.Why?To win a billion-dollar bet he made that the company would collapse.And he’s using the federal government to help win that bet.Despite what you may believe about the seediness of Washington, this is actually unprecedented.“Mr. Ackman’s campaign to take this fight ‘to the end of the earth,’ using every weapon in the arsenal that Washington offers in an attempt to bring ruin to one company, is a novel one, fusing the financial markets with the political system,” the Times said.Ackman claims he is trying to take down the company to protect Hispanics, who are apparently Herbalife’s main distributors, but Ackman’s staff says the real goal is to win that bet.The situation has led to a prominent Democrat-on-Democrat lobbying effort.Ackman read from a letter he said was written by Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., to the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation into Herbalife. The thing is, the FTC hadn't received the letter yet, and Sanchez didn't post the letter on her website until a month later -- but backdated it for good measure.Another letter, supposedly written by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also appeared on Ackman's anti-Herbalife website before the senator's press release. Markey's letter to the FTC and Securities and Exchange Commission caused Herbalife's stock to drop by 14 percent.Ackman also enlisted lobbying firms to help crush Herbalife — including one run by former Rep. Toby Moffett, D-Conn. The other firm is run by a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, Robert Walker.But wait, there's more! Ackman also hired lobbying firms run by former top aides for President Obama and President Clinton, as well as Jim Papa, who worked on legislative affairs for Obama.Also contracted: Lobbyist Larry Rasky, a former aide to Markey during his time in the House of Representatives, and lobbyist Malcolm Grace, a former aide to Sanchez. How convenient that both members of Congress would go on to assist Ackman.The Times claims Ackman also recruited “four members of Congress, a New York State senator, a City Council member in Boston, the majority leader of the Nevada Senate and other elected officials in California” to join his efforts.Herbalife followed suit, hiring a lobbying group founded by former Clinton administration aides and the Podesta Group, run by Tony Podesta, whose brother, John Podesta, was Clinton's chief of staff and is now a senior counselor in the Obama White House.Ackman has given far more to Democrats than to Republicans over the past two decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Oh, and even if Ackman loses his bet, he’s still going to “personally pursue the Herbalife matter to the end of the earth,” because he’s totally not doing it for the money, remember?

Reuters/ Brian Snyder




    The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson
    have a big front page story
    on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.
  
In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife,
a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

From the NYT:
A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a ""pyramid scheme"" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.One way to do that is to lobby.Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.
    Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters,
    Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying
    in 2013.

https://www.futureofcapitalism.com/2014/03/ackman-and-herbalifeThe New York Times has a long article detailing the lobbying on both sides, but particularly Bill Ackman's short-selling side, of the battle over Herbalife. Earlier coverage of Herbalife and of Mr. Ackman from this site is here, here, and here.Not among the three bylines on the Times article is Alison Leigh Cowan, who was described in the book Confidence Game as Mr. Ackman's pipeline into the Times. The Times article reports:In a book about his MBIA wager called ""Confidence Game,"" the reporter-turned-financial analyst Christine S. Richard chronicled how he fought with regulators for seven years before his prediction that MBIA stock would ""spiral downward"" came true. In a twist, it was Ms. Richard, who left Bloomberg News to start up the Wall Street research shop Indago Group, who gave Mr. Ackman the idea to short Herbalife.The press can be almost as powerful as, or even more powerful than, the regulators in these high-stakes battles involving shortsellers and battleground stocks. While the Times does a good job of tracing the role of the regulators, politicians, lobbyists, and advocacy groups, it leaves the press's own role mostly unexplored.Thanks to reader-participant-community member-watchdog-content co-creator N. for sending the tip.by Editor  |  Mar 10, 2014 at 11:54 am

.The New York Times has an extensive report about how, after staking $1 billion on the collapse of the nutritional supplement company, Bill Ackman’s activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management has been aggressively lobbying to bring the company down.An investigation by the Times found Ackman’s team has helped organize protests and letter-writing campaigns across the U.S. to pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife. Ackman retained the Dewey Square Group, a Washington-based firm that specializes in “grass-roots advocacy,” to influence officials by recruiting surrogates to speak out against Herbalife in emails, letters, tweets or rallies, the Times said.The report says Ackman’s team has paid civil-rights organizations at least $130,000 to collect names of people who claim they were victimized by Herbalife. Ackman has argued that he is trying to protect Hispanics, who he says are most frequently recruited by Herbalife as distributors – only to find out that there is little money to be made from selling the supplements.Herbalife has mobilized its own lobbyists to defend itself. Last month, the Times says, the company held a private briefing for more than 30 Capitol Hill aides to argue against Ackman’s charges.The Times points out Ackman so far has little to show for his efforts. Herbalife’s stock has risen, in part because billionaire investor Carl Icahn decided to buy a large stake in the company, and regulators lobbied by Ackman haven’t take any formal action against Herbalife.– Robert SchroederFollow Capitol Report on Twitter @capitolreportFollow Rob on Twitter @mktwrobsRead more from MarketWatch:Pundit’s paradise, Carl Icahn’s world and the perfect contrarian playStock market live blog

317	"Both Bill Ackman and Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) have spent a lot of money on lobbying efforts aimed to help them get their way. Ackman wants to discredit Herbalife as a pyramid scheme, while Herbalife is trying to convince regulators, lawmakers and consumer advocates that it isn’t a pyramid scheme. So far as Herbalife shares have risen, Ackman’s bet against the company got him into the red there. However, CNBC reports that he’s spent less on lobbying than Herbalife has. But then as they say, money talks, and of course there’s also the fact that Herbalife has—so far anyway—been winning the lobbying battle.The network reports that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) spent almost $2 million in its lobbying efforts last year. Bill Ackman, on the other hand, spent $264,000 last year to lobby against the company. Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF) is trying to convince policy makers that it isn’t a pyramid scheme, which is defined as a company in which distributors make more money for recruiting new distributors that they do for actually selling the company’s products.Ackman reportedly hired three Washington lobbyists last year, making it the first time the fund has ever hired lobbyists, according to the U.S. Senate Disclosure Act Database. The filing indicates that Ibarra Strategy Group earned $30,000 from Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management fund during 2013. That firm specializes in outreach to the Latino community. The activist investor maintains that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) unfairly targets minorities and low income communities, although the company says it does not. The Moffett Group earned $84,000 from Pershing Square, while Wexler and Walker Public Policy Associates earned $150,000 from the firm.Pershing may be stepping up its lobbying efforts this year, as the firm’s latest attempts have focused on discrediting Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s top distributors.Consumer advocates, including at least one Latina organization, have called for an investigation into Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s business practices. U.S. Sen. Ed Markey also called for a probe, sending letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both agencies refused to give a definitive answer on whether they were investigating, although the FTC said it was considering Sen. Markey’s request for an investigation.enter your info below & be subscribed to bothvaluewalk & valueinvestor.com (from ValueWalk)

William
  Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks at the
  Partner Connect 2013 conference in Boston
Thomson Reuters



BOSTON
  (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman, who is betting
  $1.16 billion that Herbalife is a fraud, spent $264,000 last year
  on lobbyists to press his case against the company, according to
  government documents filed in recent weeks.

  That amount is dwarfed by the nearly $2 million Herbalife spent
  in 2013 on federal lobbying as the nutrition and weight loss
  company fought the billionaire investor's claims it runs a
  pyramid scheme. In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more
  for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the
  products outside the network.

  Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hired
  three lobbyists in 2013, marking the first time ever that the New
  York-based hedge fund has spent money on Washington lobbyists,
  data from the United States Senate Disclosure Act Database show.

  In October Ibarra Strategy Group began working for Pershing
  Square and earned $30,000 for the year, the filingshows.

  The group, founded by Mickey Ibarra, a former Director of
  Intergovernmental Affairs under President Bill Clinton,
  specializes in Latino outreach.

  Ackman has accused Herbalife of unfairly targeting minorities.
  Civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens,
  which has asked California's Attorney General to probe Herbalife,
  echoed the fund manager's accusations. Herbalife said last month
  that it does not target members of minorities or low income
  communities.

  The battle for the future of Herbalife is heating up this year
  with each side trying to press its case with Washington lawmakers
  as well as regulators, who may ultimately control the company's
  fate.

  In the last days, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
  Federal Trade Commission refused to tell U.S. Senator Edward
  Markey, who asked them to probe the company, what they were doing
  on Herbalife. But each offered plenty of examples of having shut
  down illegal businesses before.

  SEC chair Mary Jo White, who last year touted the benefits of
  shareholder activism, said the SEC's Enforcement Division has
  previously probed whether statements made about a business are
  ""materially false or misleading, including statements regarding
  the compensation levels.""

  Ackman has said that 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earn
  nothing. That stands in stark contrast to some Herbalife
  distributors' testimonials where they tout lavish lifestyles as
  an incentive for others to sign up. Herbalife has said
  distributors results' depend on time, energy and dedication.

  Ackman has forecast that Herbalife's share price will plummet to
  zero amid regulators' scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in
  the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent
  in the last year. Since January, the shares have lost ground
  however, falling 17 percent.

  Pershing Square also paid $84,000 to Moffett Group, run by former
  U.S. Representative Toby Moffett, who promises to bring clients'
  messages to the highest levels in Washington.

  The bulk of its lobbying budget, $150,000, went to Wexler &
  Walker Public Policy Associates, which describes itself as a full
  service government affairs firm.

  During the same year, Herbalife spent at total $1.89 million on
  lobbying, according to public data from the Center for Responsive
  Politics.

  Herbalife paid $250,000 to government relations firm Downey
  McGrath, which counted Boeing, Microsoft and Time Warner among
  its past clients.

  IBC earned $30,000 from Herbalife last year while $140,000 went
  to Ogilvy, $160,000 was paid to Podesta Group and $40,000 went to
  Glover Park Group.

  Herbalife also spent $1.27 million on lobbying on its own behalf.

  Separately the company made a $10,000 donation last year to
  Democratic Attorneys General Association, according to the Center
  for Responsive Politics. Pershing Square did not donate to this
  group. California's Attorney General, Kamala Harris, the person
  the Latin civil rights group LULAC last year asked to probe
  Herbalife is a Democrat.

332	Reuters Staff3 Min Read(Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines on Monday said cancellations of thousands of flights would hurt first-quarter profit, but some added that revenue would still show improvement. Flight cancellations tend to add to airline costs during the first quarter, when winter storms hit the hardest. Five U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) - said that winter storms had led to more than 78,000 canceled flights among them. Some airlines cited a noticeable increase in their canceled flights tied to bad weather this year, with American Airlines saying its 28,000 cancellations for January and February more than doubled from the year earlier. Delta said that as of the end of January, its cancellations from bad weather had topped all of those for 2013. Delta told a J.P. Morgan investor conference disruption from winter storms hurt revenue for the current quarter by $90 million as it canceled 17,000 flights. The storms dented pretax profit for the quarter by about $55 million, Delta added. The carrier said it expected operating margin, a measure of income to costs, of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent for the first quarter, compared with a prior view of 6 percent to 8 percent. Cancellations can help unit revenue, an important measure of pricing power and how full planes are, as more travelers are put on remaining flights. Delta said unit revenue would rise 3 percent to 4 percent in the current quarter, compared with its prior view of a 2 percent to 4 percent increase. American added it still expected unit revenue to rise about 2 percent to 4 percent in the period. United said it halted 23,000 flights tied to weather in the first two months of 2014. The company had disclosed last month that disruption from the storms would hurt first-quarter unit revenue. JetBlue told the same conference it canceled nearly 4,000 flights because of the winter storms, and Southwest said it halted about 6,500 flights in January and February. JetBlue forecast a 1 percent to 2 percent rise in first quarter unit revenue, while Southwest outlined expected growth of 3 percent. Cowen & Co airline analyst Helane Becker cut her first quarter profit estimate for Delta to 30 cents a share from 32 cents in a note to clients, citing the updated outlook. She raised her quarterly estimate for Southwest to 17 cents a share from 14 cents, but also cut her estimate for JetBlue for the period to 6 cents a share from 13 cents. Shares of the major U.S. airlines ended mixed, with Delta down 0.5 percent to $35.17 and United off 2.3 percent to $46.66. American was off 0.2 percent to $38.96 and JetBlue fell 1.8 percent to $8.87. Southwest shares rose 2.2 percent to $23.60.

Due to its greater reach along the U.S. East Coast arising from its recent merger with US Airways, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) said Monday that it has ended its inline agreements with JetBlue Airways Corp. (NASDAQ: JBLU), which covered ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs.Such agreements allow customers to buy connecting flights for participating carriers on one ticket, and they allow airlines to offer more destinations without having to make large investments. JetBlue has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, and CEO Dave Barger said Monday that the partnership with American Airlines was “not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have.”Also, customers of American Airlines and JetBlue using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, as of April 1. Points already accrued through the partnership would be credited to customers’ accounts and will not be affected.American also reported Monday that severe weather had an impact on performance in the first two months of the year. However, total revenue passenger miles for February were up 0.5% year-on-year to 15.1 billion, and total capacity was 0.8% higher to 19.2 billion available seat miles.American Airlines shares were up fractionally to $39.10 in mid-day trading Monday. The 52-week range is $14.71 to $39.88.JetBlue’s shares were down fractionally, to $8.95 in a 52-week range of $5.95 to $9.45.By Trey Thoelcke"	Business

View Analyst Ratings for JetBlue Airways.Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about JetBlue Airways stock:
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, ""Shares of JetBlue Airways have underperformed its industry so far this year. The stock has also been plagued by multiple challenges of late. Adding to its woes, the carrier's eanings in third quarter declined year over year due to high costs. The recent hurricanes also hurt results. In fact the hurricanes might hurt results in the fourth quarter as well. Operating expenses too increased significantly in the quarter with fuel expenses increasing a massive 18.3%. The persistent rise in fuel and labor costs have the potential to hurt results going forward. However, the carrier's revenues in third quarter increased 4.7%, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,809.3 million. Passenger revenues improved 3.3% in the quarter. We are impressed by the carrier's efforts to expand its popular Mint service. Efforts to bring down its debt levels also please us."" (11/15/2017)
2. Imperial Capital analysts commented, ""We are maintaining our Outperform rating and our one-year price target of $29 on JBLU shares. We are lowering our EPS estimates on lower than expected 1Q17 unit revenues. Our price target is about 45% above the recent share price. We are lowering our 1Q17 EPS estimate to $0.26 from $0.34, our FY17 EPS estimate to $1.75 from $1.85, and our FY18 EPS estimate to $1.95 from $2.05.

342	Reuters Staff3 Min Read* To end ticketing agreement effective Monday * To also end reciprocal frequent-flyer program * Merger with US Airways gives “greater connectivity” - spokesman March 10 (Reuters) - American Airlines said it planned to end agreements covering ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs with JetBlue Airways after its merger with US Airways gave it “greater connectivity” along the U.S. East Coast. American Airlines, which merged with US Airways in December to form American Airlines Group Inc, had a so-called interline agreement with JetBlue that allowed customers to buy connecting flights on each other’s planes on one ticket. New York-based JetBlue has 80 percent of its operations in the U.S. Northeast. “Through the merger with US Airways, American’s network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement,” American Airlines’ spokesman Casey Norton wrote in an email to Reuters. Carriers enter into interline agreements because they allow them to offer more destinations without having to make large investments. The partnership with American Airlines was “not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have,” JetBlue Chief Executive Dave Barger said at a JP Morgan conference in New York City on Monday. JetBlue, which has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, also said it expected unit revenue, a measure of passenger revenue per available seat mile, to rise 1-2 percent in the current quarter. American Airlines and JetBlue will not accept new interline ticket sales with each other from Monday, the companies said in a statement. The carriers also said customers using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs would no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, effective April 1. The frequent-flyer program agreement between the two includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. All American Airlines’ “AAdvantage” miles or JetBlue’s “TrueBlue” points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and will not be affected, the carriers said. American Airlines Group also said its February load factor, or percentage of seats sold, fell to 78.4 percent from 78.7 percent a year earlier. American Airlines shares were down about 1 percent at $38.55 in early trading. JetBlue’s shares were down 0.55 percent.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

People across the country took 10.7 billion rides on public transit in 2013. Since the mid '90s, ridership growth has been outpacing population growth.         PSTA is seeing continued ridership growth. Credit PSTA    The numbers in Tampa Bay are up as well, with the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) closing last year with about 14.5 million rides.""That was up about three percent from the year before,"" PSTA CEO Brad Miller said.Miller was in Washington D.C. Monday, asking Congress to invest more in public transportation. He says people are looking for different ways to get around.""The younger generations are riding transit more and driving less and in Pinellas County we're definitely looking to the future at that,"" he said.Public transit advocates in Pinellas County are hoping to implement the Greenlight Pinellas Plan if a proposed 1 percent sales tax referendum passes in the November elections. The plan includes a 65 percent increase in bus service options and a start-up for light rail.View the discussion thread.This story is part of a project on commuting in America.

359	"In the past 18 months, TriMet bus drivers have been on the receiving end of some brutal attacks, including three stabbings and a vicious beating at a North Portland stop last fall.On that, the driver’s union and management at Oregon’s largest transit agency agree. But Amalgamated Transit Union 757, tangled up in an ugly showdown with management over health benefits, is claiming that TriMet managers are intentionally downplaying the number of times riders assault bus and train operators. TriMet officials have maintained that serious assaults on its drivers -- while a heinous reality of the job -- are rare. ATU, however, is circulating a list of 130 reported incidents dating to May 2010 that it says have been intentionally hidden from the public.Operations managers at the transit agency say most of the cases – dozens of incidents of riders spitting on drivers, for example – don’t meet the legal definition of assault and many reports were later found to be unsubstantiated. “The ATU leadership’s accusations are inaccurate and the document (supplied by the union) contains just initial information inputted by a controller or dispatcher,” said Roberta Altstadt, a TriMet spokeswoman, in an email.Fair or not, the ATU’s “list of invisible assaults,” which is it says it plans to make public, is demonstrative of how the union is taking its fight to keep its generous health-care benefits to the people. The public, said Bruce Hansen, ATU 757 president, needs to know about the on-the-job hazards that operators face every day. “There is a reason that we need the (health care) benefits that we have fought for,” Hansen said. “Failing to record theses assaults goes to show how TriMet tries to deceive the public, whether its with operator assaults or wages.”Of course, not all of the “reported assaults” on documents shared with The Oregonian involve weapons or flying fists. In fact, the average person would probably dismiss many of them – thrown cups of coffee, spitting and a snowball thrown through an open driver’s window – as small potatoes. But ATU claims bus drivers consider them attacks that make it hard for them to safely ferry passengers in the Portland metro area, while destroying morale on the job.What's more, Hansen said, TriMet needs to start taking spit attacks more seriously, especially since some diseases can be transmitted by saliva if it gets in a driver's eye or mouth. Under Oregon law, spitting on a law enforcement or corrections officer is classified as assault. But the statute doesn't apply to other public employees.Hansen said other incidents on the list clearly cross a line that TriMet isn’t willing to acknowledge. In one case, a driver reported that she asked a man who was vomiting at the back of a bus to step off. A woman traveling with the man reportedly responded by shoving the driver and throwing paper towels drenched with vomit at her.   “That one just disgusted me when I saw it,” Hansen said. Altstadt said the agency takes reports of menacing or physical attacks against its drivers seriously. But TriMet, she said, doesn’t determine definitions of crimes. Police analysts, guided by the FBI’s Uniformed Crime Reporting, define many of the initial calls on the list don't meet the definition of assault -- even if they're found to be true.“Spitting – even in the face – is generally categorized as harassment but may be categorized as an assault by the PPB crime records specialist depending on the full details of the incident,” she said. In countless cases, Altstadt said, harassment, assaults and concerns about weapons on the transit system turn out to be baseless.  
























 
 


TriMet bus driver Ivan Bissell is assaulted at Washington Square Transit Center
TriMet bus driver Ivan Bissell describes being assaulted by an ""agitated"" passenger on his bus at the Washington Square Transit Center Friday Morning.




	


 
As an example, Altstadt recalled a recent report from a train operator who said a rider spotted an elderly woman in a trailing car who apparently had a “shotgun.” In the end, it turned out to be a cane. “Our staff looks into each security related incident --  again, crime or not  -- to see how security might be improved,” Altstadt said. “We are also transparent about reported crimes on our system.”On the long list of incidents being circulated by the ATU to the media, the most common type is passengers spitting at drivers. (Not surprisingly, most reported confrontations result from bus drivers simply asking free-loaders to pay their fare.)Whether or not you believe the next contract with TriMet union workers should maintain the most generous public-employee health benefits in Oregon, the ATU list serves as a reminder that your bus driver deserves a big “thank you” during the evening commute.  Of course, you might want to think twice about trying to hug him or her. One of the reported assaults was an unwanted kiss.Here’s the complete list of reported incidents -- which TriMet says are largely unverified initial calls -- broken down by type from May 2010 to the end of 2013:-- Joseph RoseThere's a bevy of car-sharing options, each with a slightly different business model.

361	by GOSIA WOZNIACKA, Associated PressPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - While the use of buses, trains and subways is on the rise in many U.S. cities, ridership in the Portland region's much touted TriMet system has fallen off. New data released by the American Public Transportation Association shows it was down 3.8 percent from the past year.In 2013, TriMet recorded 98.8 million rides, compared to about 102.7 million rides in 2012.TriMet's spokeswoman Mary Fetsch says the recent decrease is due to the elimination of the Free Rail Zone in Portland, fare hikes, more fare enforcement, and service cuts made during the recession.The agency says it has added back more bus service in September and has restored frequent bus service on its busiest Portland routes. A new Portland-to-Milwaukie light rail line is also slated to open in 2015.Ridership on MAX, the TriMet's light rail, saw the largest dip, 6.1 percent. Some 38.4 million trips were taken on MAX in 2013, about 2,000 less than the previous year.TriMet bus ridership also decreased 2.4 percent, going from about 60.4 million rides in 2012 to about 58.9 million in 2013.The area's commuter rail line saw more success. The Westside Express Service or WES, which connects Beaverton and Wilsonville, saw a 10 percent increase in ridership. Rides increased from 430,000 in 2012 to 480,000 in 2013.Federal officials have previously hailed Portland area's public transportation as visionary, easy to use and a model for other cities. TriMet's bus and MAX routes carry a combined 312,000 riders on an average weekday.Over the past two decades, ridership of TriMet has steadily increased until the Great Recession and then leveled. It declined, especially on MAX, between 2012 and 2013.Other mass transit systems in Oregon also didn't see much rise in ridership.The Salem-Keizer Transit, popularly known as Cherriots, also saw a decrease of 2.4 percent. And ridership of Wilsonville's South Metro Area Regional Transit  aka SMART  remained stagnant.Nationally, public transit systems saw the highest total of rides since 1956  nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013. Cities such as Houston, New York, Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego saw large ridership gains.	Business

  Americans took 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last
  year, the most since 1957, according to a new report from the American
  Public Transportation Association (APTA).

  From 2012 to 2013, public transit use rose 1.1%, while miles
  driven rose .3%. Since 1995, public transit use has grown by
  37.2%, while the population rose 20.3%. Some of the biggest
  growth came from commuter rail services, whose use climbed 2.1%:
  Austin, Philadelphia, Anchorage, Minneapolis, and Portland,
  Oregon all reported double-digit increases.

  The APTA report attributes the growth to the economic recovery,
  which creates more commutes, and federal investment in public
  transit. ""That is why Congress needs to act this year to pass a
  new transportation bill,"" APTA President and CEO Michael
  Melaniphy said in a press release.

(KMOX) – Public transportation officials are finally getting what they’ve long been pushing for—increased ridership.Now, they’ve got to find a way to pay for it.Metro president and CEO John Nations is in Washington, D.C. to lobby on behalf of the American Public Transportation Association.“Americans are riding at record numbers, ” he says. “We’re seeing demand that we have not seen since the 50s and the 60s, and we’re looking for a long-term funding solution. Historically, the federal government had made commitments for five or six years in a funding program.”He says in 2013 there were more than 10.5 billion trips taken on public buses and trains—the highest ridership levels since the mid-1950s.Nations will offer first-hand testimony on the explosive growth. Twice in the past 24 months St. Louis has led the nation in percentage growth for Metro bus and MetroLink riders.He and his group will urge members of Congress to increase federal funding for public transit so they can keep up with the growing number of riders.(TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

Now fuel is well under four dollars and they’re continuing to stay. It’s also driven by growth and the economy. As people go back to work they’re riding transit more. About 50 percent of all trips are on transit.”According to the Indiana Department of Transportation’s 2012 Public Transit Report, one percent of people over 16 used public transportation to get to work in Indiana, compared to the national average of 5.2 percent. A new proposed bill to expand mass transit in Central Indiana, however, could help to increase these rates.Vice President of Government Relations for the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Mark Fisher supports the bill and says the new report attests to public transportation’s long-term viability.“People are choosing different lifestyles than they were even 10 or 15 years ago where it was a continuous push out to suburbs. Transit provides a very cost-effective option for them to be able to move around their community,” Fisher says.If the proposed bill passes, funding would come from fares as well as business and local income taxes.Network Indiana contributed to this report.Want to contact your legislators about an issue that matters to you?

369	Reuters Staff3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans took a record 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last year as an increase in urban living, costlier fuel, more investment and an economic upturn helped drive ridership, an industry group said on Monday. 2013 was the eighth straight year in which more than 10 billion trips were taken on U.S. public buses, subways, commuter rail and streetcars, the American Public Transportation Association(APTA) said in a report. 2013 marked the highest level of ridership since 1956, it said. “It’s all about, if you build it, they will come. The investment pays off,” APTA President and Chief Executive Michael Melaniphy said in a telephone interview. Melaniphy said the increase in part reflected increased investment in public transit by the federal government, along with that by states and cities which want to attract new businesses and workers. The U.S. trend toward urban living and walkable cities also is behind the upturn in ridership. A surge in ridership that came in 2008 when gasoline and diesel prices spiked has continued even though the cost of fuel has fallen, Melaniphy said. “People are coming and staying,” he said. The upturn in the U.S. economy also means more people commuting to work. Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent. The increase has outpaced a 20.3 percent rise in population and a 22.7 percent upturn in vehicle miles traveled, the report said. Among transport sectors, ridership for heavy rail, or subways and elevated trains, was up 2.8 percent last year. Commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail, or streetcars and trolleys, experienced a 1.6 percent increase in ridership. Buses overall saw a 0.1 percent fall, though ridership in cities with less than 100,000 population rose almost 4 percent. Cities with the largest increases in ridership included: - Salt Lake City, which saw a 103.3 percent in commuter rail traffic after the opening of a new line in December 2012; - Austin, Texas, with a 37.3 percent rise in commuter rail use; - Miami, with an increase of almost 11 percent in heavy rail use, largely because of increased frequency during peak hours; - and New Orleans, with a 29 percent rise in light rail use. Release of the report coincided with the APTA Legislative Conference in Washington, which is aimed at helping shape federal and industry policy.

370	"The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.Filed Under: TransitThe Expo Line is heavy rail?Los Angeles’ 4.8 percent heavy rail increase presumably was on the
Red/Purple Lines, since they’re the only heavy rail in the LA Metro
system. The Expo Line accounts for a significant portion of Los Angeles’ 6.0 percent increase in light rail ridership.It’s a little disingenuous to say “Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving” without qualifying that the comparison uses *percentages*. Because passenger miles driven is many times greater than passenger miles traveled via transit, the small (0.3%) increase reported for VMT in 2013 actually involved more miles than the 1.1% increase reported for transit use.I’m going to appeal to demography and point out that the US population has doubled since 1956, so it’s not exactly a victory that transit trips have hit a 57-year high.It’s great that transit use has risen in recent years, but overall growth in population suggests that our baseline expectation should be growth in transit use, not stagnation.Yes. Per capita transit ridership in the US plummeted from the 50s to the 70s, while it’s held relatively stable since then. In the long run we’re not making much of a dent on this stagnation yet.Indeed. The population has more than doubled since 1950, meaning per capita, there are 1/2 as many transit trips as in 1950. When you look only at urban population, it’s even worse. In 1950, around 100 million people lived in urban areas, increasing to about 250 million in 2010. So with 2.5 times the urban population, we have the exact # of transit trips. It’s not surprising we have bad congestion and long commutes.I think this is classic and depressing misuse of statistics to paint a picture somebody wants to believe in.  I checked census data and found approximately 163 million residents in the U.S. In 1956.  As of March, 2014 there are 317 million, nearly twice the population of 1956.  Finally topping 1956 transit miles shows a good trend, but total miles are nearly meaningless if one is looking at per capita transit use today at one half the rate it was in 1956.It’s in the ridership report link to from the article. Heavy rail numbers are for  Metrolink with Los Angeles listed as the “primary city” for this system.True the % of total population using transit is small; but it is growing.   If we could pry loose the funding to have as much transit adjacent our homes and work as was the case in 1956 (few suburbs had been built compared to now and the “edge cities” of offices none) the numbers would be very different.I don’t think either way is “disingenuous,” but your way has its flaws too. A transit trip can be very, very short, so lots of them might not add up to anywhere near as many miles. And is a typical car trip worth more than a typical transit trip economically?  Doubtful.I’m sure it’s the milestone that excites people, but 1.1% growth really is crappy.  At that rate, transit use doubles from its already meh number in ~63 years.  Get the growth up to New York’s rail network’s growth and that time period drops to just under 17 years. If we want to do better, we need to see transit construction fire up again.Here’s a link on increased transit use in northern Utah:http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/57659844-78/transportation-bus-train-utah.html.cspIt’s light rail, but it connects to the two heavy rail lines, so it accounts for some of the ridership increase there. Of course, some of that increase comes from people like me, who used to take a 40 minute bus ride down Vermont Ave, but now take a 15 minute heavy rail trip to downtown follows by a 12 minute light rail trip to work – that probably shouldn’t count as an overall increase in transit ridership, but it probably does in this methodology.What happens if we restrict not to “urban areas” (which include large suburban areas that aren’t very well served by transit at all) but to center city areas that had decent transit service in 1956? I would be moderately surprised if these areas had a population increase anywhere near doubling (especially given that many of the center cities have actually *decreased* in population since 1956, like Washington, Boston, San Francisco, and Chicago).But you’re right that this is the more significant number to figure out about.In 1956, the U.S. population was 170.3 million; in 2013. It was 315.8 million.
Population increased 85%, ridership was unchanged.In 1956, U.S. VMT was 237.7 billion; in 2012, it was 2,994.4 billion – 1,160% growth.Transit ridership (demand) increases by 10% but the service (supply) increased nearly 4 times? We spend These statistics look at only one side of the equation. Will anyone look at both sides of the equation or do some research?It all about Ridership on Trax & FrontRunner UTA Executives Earn Excessive Salaries & Bonuses at Taxpayers Expense. UTA has a very Poor Bus System. There need to be a Full Investigation into Utah Transit Authority.The pattern of growth isn’t suprising.  In small cities (population <100,000) traffic is usually (not always) low enough that the buses can run more or less on time, even in mixed traffic.In big cities, the buses don't have a chance and people will take rail or drive if they can.The problem is really the large areas with no usable transit service.  In big cities, due to traffic, usable means rail, with sidewalks to get to the stations.In suburbs without sidewalks, there is no possibility of usable tranist.Network effects.  Expo Line is showing much larger ridership than expected by planners, and this is because planners failed to account for people changing trains to catch the Expo Line.Observed behavior, in studies, is that most people will make maybe one transfer, maximum, from a bus to a bus — but will make a *large* number of train to train transfers.  This isn’t factored into most estimates, so there’s a consistent trend of planners underestimating train ridership once the train starts to be part of a network.Yeah, those areas with low density and an extremely disconnected street grid are basically locked in to car dependency. Yet they are the vast majority of the urban area that we built since 1950 They will need to be dramatically rebuilt in order to have a remote chance of supporting transit or walking.Growth may be down in Portland because they are slowly starting to enforce fare collection.  At any given time, about 10% of the riders are transients, and if they can’t ride for free, well then ridership falls.  Another factor is the inequitable approach we take in Portlandia: downtown is nice because they let the rest of the city go to heck.  The outer neighborhoods have no sidewalks and infrequent bus service because we just had to have the slow fancy street cars for the new rich retirees.  If we paid attention to the bus system, transit use would rise.If you want to really dig into it, some regions have made a dent and others haven’t.For instance, there’s been vast growth of population in the Deep South — and it’s pretty much *all* transit wastelands, even Atlanta.  Texas does slightly better and Arizona is finally doing *something*.  But if you looked at per capita transit ridership strictly in New England or California, for instance, the picture would look a lot rosier."	Business

375	"Listen Live4 years ago in NationalGET ON THE BUS, GUS: 2013 marked the highest level of ridership since 1956,. Photo: clipart.comWASHINGTON (Reuters) – Americans took a record 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last year as an increase in urban living, costlier fuel, more investment and an economic upturn helped drive ridership, an industry group said on Monday.2013 was the eighth straight year in which more than 10 billion trips were taken on U.S. public buses, subways, commuter rail and streetcars, the American Public Transportation Association(APTA) said in a report.2013 marked the highest level of ridership since 1956, it said.“It’s all about, if you build it, they will come. The investment pays off,” APTA President and Chief Executive Michael Melaniphy said in a telephone interview.Melaniphy said the increase in part reflected increased investment in public transit by the federal government, along with that by states and cities which want to attract new businesses and workers.The U.S. trend toward urban living and walkable cities also is behind the upturn in ridership. A surge in ridership that came in 2008 when gasoline and diesel prices spiked has continued even though the cost of fuel has fallen, Melaniphy said.“People are coming and staying,” he said. The upturn in the U.S. economy also means more people commuting to work.Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent.The increase has outpaced a 20.3 percent rise in population and a 22.7 percent upturn in vehicle miles traveled, the report said.Among transport sectors, ridership for heavy rail, or subways and elevated trains, was up 2.8 percent last year. Commuter rail rose 2.1 percent.Light rail, or streetcars and trolleys, experienced a 1.6 percent increase in ridership. Buses overall saw a 0.1 percent fall, though ridership in cities with less than 100,000 population rose almost 4 percent.Cities with the largest increases in ridership included:– Salt Lake City, which saw a 103.3 percent in commuter rail traffic after the opening of a new line in December 2012;– Austin, Texas, with a 37.3 percent rise in commuter rail use;– Miami, with an increase of almost 11 percent in heavy rail use, largely because of increased frequency during peak hours;– and New Orleans, with a 29 percent rise in light rail use.Release of the report coincided with the APTA Legislative Conference in Washington, which is aimed at helping shape federal and industry policy.(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Chris Francescani and Jonathan Oatis)3 hours ago

376	Listen to storyLast year, Americans used public transportation to take 10.7 billion trips. According to the American Public Transportation Association, ridership hasn’t been that high since 1956.“It’s truly a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities,” says Michael Melaniphy, the group’s president and CEO, noting the growth started several years ago.“Initially, when fuel prices spiked, it drove people to transit, and once they came, they decided it was good, and they stayed.”There is a correlation, Melaniphy says, between high ridership and the health of the U.S. economy. Sixty percent of trips taken on public transit are work commutes.However, Michael Moss, who directs the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, argues the other 40 percent is also important: “Mass transit today is not just a peak-hour activity,” he says. As public transportation becomes more popular, and as cities spend more money on expanding it, transit systems are opening earlier and closing later.“There was a time when you said, ‘I want to live near a good school district,’” Moss says. “Today, people want to live near a good transit connection.”Moss is referring to young people especially, who are ever less likely to own cars.Featured in: Marketplace Morning Report for Monday, March 10, 2014Sign up to get KPCC's Short List newsletter.

Indeed, ridership on D.C.'s heavy rail system decreased by 2.65 percent. (From 280,904,200 in 2012 to 273,464,800 in 2013.) But bus ridership increased by 3.45 percent over the same time period. (From 130,236,700 in 2012 to 134,726,100 in 2013.)Combined, the system saw a .72 percent decrease in ridership between 2012 and 2013, according to APTA's info. In an oversight report to the D.C. Council, Metro put its rail ridership between January and December of 2013 at 245,913,697. Bus ridership was not provided.

383	Public transportation trips reached 10.7 billion last year, the greatest number of rides since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), Time reported. Overall public transportation use grew 1.1 percent last year, and is up 37 percent from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to APTA. Ridership on Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority (DART) buses was up 15 percent year-over-year in December. December ridership totaled 347,213 passengers. The increase is significant because December is the first month for which year-over-year comparisons can be made after DART added or changed a number of routes in November 2012. Read more in the Business Record. 	Business

Now there’s data to prove it.The American Public Transportation Association’s latest figures, released today, show that more Americans used public transit in 2013 than at any time in nearly 60 years. That amounts to a whopping 10.65 billion passenger trips, beating the previous record in 1956 and a more recent peak in 2008, when gas cost more than $4 a gallon and 10.59 million trips were taken.This time around high gas prices aren’t the main reason, and the trend is more about a basic shift in attitudes about how people travel in their cities, as well as a generally strong urban economy. Michael Melaniphy, president of the advocacy group, told the New York Times:“Now gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,” Mr. Melaniphy said in an interview. “We’re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities.”From 1995 to 2013, transit ridership rose 37 percent, well ahead of a 20 percent growth in population and a 23 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled, according to the association’s data.Cities should be paying attention, especially as many aim to attract young people to live and work in their borders. Young people traveling more often at “off-peak” times accounted for some of the increases seen over the last year, the New York Times reported.  Public transit agencies reporting the biggest ridership increases included those in smaller cities, such as Ann Arbor, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Riverside, California.These are all reasons for cities to invest more in subways, buses, and rail systems though that is sure to raise the hackles of dedicated drivers. It may pay to note, however, more than 70% of transit tax efforts succeeded in the last two years, according to the association.Jessica Leber is a staff editor and writer for Fast Company's Co.Exist.

While the number of national vehicle miles traveled on roads increased 0.3 percent, public transportation use in 2013 increased by 1.1 percent, according to the study.“As the highest annual ridership number since 1956, Americans in growing numbers want to have more public transit services in their communities,” Peter Varga, APTA Chair and CEO of the Grand Rapids’ transit authority in Michigan, said in a press release. “Public transportation systems nationwide — in small, medium, and large communities — saw ridership increases.

With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, the numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.Heavy rail (subways and elevated trains) ridership saw the biggest jump with 2.8 percent nationally in 2013. Increased service during peak hours in Miami accounted for the bulk of the jump, increasing local usage by 10.6 percent. Commuter rails also became more popular as ridership increased 2.1 percent nationally. A new rail line in Salt Lake City, Utah, which opened in 2012, registered more than double the number of passengers compared to last year.

More Americans rode trains, buses, streetcars and subways last year than at any time since 1956. That's according to new figures released by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). In fact, more than 10.7 billion journeys were made by public transit nationally, and transit ridership is up 37.2 percent since 1995.

So what's going on? 

Certainly, as the APTA notes, the economic recovery will be playing a role. But there are broader trends that point to a long-term growth in ridership, including increased urbanization.

Here's how The Guardian explains the shift:

“People want to work and live along transit lines,” said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association. “Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.”

The best part of all this is that as ridership increases, more, better and cleaner transportation options should increase too. In my neck of the woods, plans are finally moving forward with a Chapel Hill-Durham light rail link, and the rise of car sharing is making car ownership optional for many. And then there's the steady spread of electrified, zero-emission buses to look forward to also. 

We may indeed be living in a golden age of public transit. And it's about time.

Taking transit hasn't been so popular 1956, the year that Marilyn Monroe wowed in Bus Stop.People are driving less, and some say we really are at peak car. So how are people getting around? It turns out a lot more people are taking transit, the most in 57 years. The American Public Transportation Association is jubilant:""Last year people took 10.7 billion trips on public transportation. As the highest annual ridership number since 1956, Americans in growing numbers want to have more public transit services in their communities,” said Peter Varga, APTA Chair and CEO of The Rapid in Grand Rapids, MI. “Public transportation systems nationwide – in small, medium, and large communities – saw ridership increases. Some reported all-time high ridership numbers.”The stats are pretty impressive:Since 1995 public transit ridership is up 37.2 percent, outpacing population growth, which is up 20.3 percent, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which is up 22.7 percent.Often people claim that the lousy economy makes people take cheaper transit rather than drive. The APTA claims the opposite:Another reason behind the ridership increases is the economic recovery in certain areas. When more people are employed, public transportation ridership increases since nearly 60 percent of the trips taken on public transportation are for work commutes.”Light Rail in Minneapolis/ wikipedia/CC BY 2.0Toronto opponents of light rail should note that the statistics here are pretty impressive. One can go on and on about how light rail has more stops that are closer together so that it can do a better (and cheaper) job of serving neighborhoods than subways can.Light rail (modern streetcars, trolleys, and heritage trolleys) ridership increased 1.6 percent in 2013 with 17 out of 27 transit systems reporting increases. Systems that showed double digit increases in 2013 were located in the following cities: New Orleans, LA (28.9%); Denver, CO (14.9%); and San Diego, CA (10.4%). Ridership in the following cities also saw increases in 2013: Seattle, WA – Sound Transit (9.8%); Pittsburgh, PA (7.5%); Salt Lake City, UT (6.8%); Los Angeles, CA (6.0%); San Jose, CA (3.6%); and Philadelphia, PA (3.5%).Read more at the APTA press release.We really are at peak carNew study shows how better communication technology is leading to l...Tea Party Says Don't Build Light Rail, It Might Attract TerroristsElectric barges are coming back to European canals

391	Public transportation trips reached 10.7 billion last year, the greatest number of rides since 1956.Overall public transportation use grew 1.1% in 2013, and is up 37.2% from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Last year was the eighth year in a row that over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation across America. There were even more trips than in 2008 when gas prices rose to $4-$5 a gallon, and more Americans were opting out of driving, USA Today reports.The APTA says economic recovery is a predominant reason for more transit rides, since public transportation use increases when more people have jobs. The APTA reports that about 60% of trips taken last year were people commuting to work.[APTA]	Business
392	More Americans used public transit last year than in any year since 1956, according to a new report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).Americans took 10.7 billion trips on subways, streetcars, buses and other forms of public transportation in 2013, according to the report, making last year the eighth year in a row with more than 10 billion trips taken on public transportation. The report found that public transit ridership in the U.S. has jumped 37.2 percent since 1995, an increase that’s outpaced population growth and vehicle miles traveled.The last time public transit ridership was at an all-time high was 2008, when gas prices spiked in the U.S., reaching $4 and $5 per gallon in some places. In 2013, however, gas prices as a whole were lower, a fact the group says means that public transit isn’t soley reliant on transportation costs.“Now gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,” Michael Melaniphy, president of APTA told the New York Times. “We’re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities.”The group said in a release that part of the reason for the spike in public transit usage was the economic recovery of some cities — with more people employed, there are more people relying on public transit to get to work every day. And, Melaniphy said, the inverse is true as well: cities that invest in public transit often see shrinking unemployment rates, because people have access to job opportunities that may have been off-limits before.Americans aren’t just taking public transit more often, however. They’re also driving less, according to a 2013 report from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The report found that the amount of miles driven per person has dropped in 46 states since 2007, with Washington, D.C. residents driving the least and young people across the country driving less than older generations.If this trend of fewer miles driven and more miles spent on a bus or subway continues, it won’t just be good for the environment — it’ll also be good for Americans’ health. Multiple studies have linked air pollution exposure to heart damage and birth defects, and exposure to traffic pollution in particular could be linked to kidney damage.	Business

394	"Number of trips reaches 10.7 billion in 2013 as the economy recovers from recession and population shifts to the citiesAssociated Press

Mon 10 Mar 2014 04.31 GMT


Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 23.30 BST

Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time in half a century.They made nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013 – the highest total since 1956, according to passenger data reported by transit systems nationally and released on Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the recession in the wake of the financial crisis. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.“People are making a fundamental shift to having options” aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association. “This is a long-term trend.”Expanding bus and train networks help push the growth.Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large passenger gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area’s huge transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation’s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.“People want to work and live along transit lines,” Melaniphy said. “Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.”"	Business

397	The DiplomatIf Japan had volunteered to join the search for Flight 370, could that help thaw tensions between Tokyo and Beijing?For China and Chinese leaders, the past week was not an easy one. The terrorist attack in Kunming left at least 29 dead and more than 130 wounded. Now, the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 inevitably has made the situation more anxious.As hours turn into days, a multinational rescue team has started searching for the missing plane. According to China Daily (Chinese), as of March 9, 11 countries have joined in an international search and rescue operation after this flight mysteriously disappeared from radar. China Daily says vessels and aircraft in this international rescue operation come from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Britain. The 239 people on board, including 227 passengers, are from 11 different countries, according to a Malaysia Airlines press briefing. 154 of the missing passengers are Chinese, including one from Taiwan. There are no citizens from Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines, aboard the missing plane, but all four countries are close to the incident site and have joined the search efforts. Other countries, such as Britain, participated in the search for MH370 despite not having any citizens involved and a large geographical distance.There are no Japanese citizens on MH370, and given the current situation on East China Sea, Japan certainly has no obligation to join the rescue. However, Japan has the most advanced technology and facility in Asia-Pacific region, highly trained rescue personnel, and extensive experiences in disaster management. So what if Japan had volunteered to join the MH370 international rescue operation?China has been closely watching Japan’s overseas operations. If a Japanese civilian rescue team participated in the search, would Beijing  regard it as at least a positive and friendly gesture in the enduring Sino-Japanese standoff? Such a gesture might just help to promote bilateral dialogues and ease the tensions that have been created by historical and territorial disputes. Both China and Japan did enjoy a symbolic friendship when then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Japan’s earthquake-hit area on May 21, 2011 “to convey the Chinese people’s sympathies for the local people and to demonstrate China’s support for Japan’s reconstruction efforts.” However, the Sino-Japanese relationship hit the rocks again in 2012 after this period of brief amity.The Sino-Japanese bilateral relationship has reached a deadlock and there seems to be no panacea for this conundrum in the near future. Under these circumstances, more indirect approaches might help to make some changes, if not outright diplomatic achievements. Such indirect actions could simply serve to send intended messages, especially at a time when high-level inter-governmental channels have basically failed. One such notable case, reported by media from both countries, took place in mid-November 2013, when the Japanese government recognized a Chinese student for saving a Japanese boy from drowning.Unfortunately, that moment was just a flash in the pan, and reconciliation between these two neighbors is still nowhere to be seen. According to Xinhua (Chinese), on February 28, Japan’s Foreign Ministry held a meeting with Japan’s 30 ambassadors to Asia-Pacific countries such as China, South Korea, and Australia. The Foreign Ministry urged the ambassadors to “defeat the opposite side [China] by substantially utilizing their personal charm and hit hard on those governments.” Obviously, Japan’s Foreign Ministry intends to fight back against China’s previous round of public diplomacy in global media.However, a spiraling escalation of confrontation ultimately is not what can help to solve territorial disputes, especially between China and Japan, both of which are giant economies with growing military capability. At this moment when war preparations seem to appear in both countries, it is critically urgent to find all possible opportunities to take a step back and to give each country a way out. It may not be another award for a notable deed, but could be something more emotionally and intuitively acceptable and thus helpful to ease the bilateral confrontation. Both China and Japan should find or create these opportunities.	Business

400	Reuters Staff4 Min Read* China Feb exports tumble, stoke slowdown fears * Oil production at Libya’s El Sharara field restarted * Coming up: API data Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT)   (Rewrites top, updates with settlement prices, adds analyst commentary) By Jeanine Prezioso and Elizabeth Dilts NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. oil fell by more than $1 per barrel on Monday to a three-week low, pressured by an unexpected drop in China’s exports that stoked fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. Oil prices were weighed by moderate temperatures that reduced the need for heating fuels and refinery maintenance season in the U.S., when demand typically wanes. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories were forecast to have risen by 2.2 million barrels on average last week, according to a Reuters survey taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration. As well, oil on both sides of the Atlantic was pressured by easing fears over the crisis in Crimea. “We’re rolling into refinery maintenance season and the market was bid up too far on the Ukrainian news,” said Paul Smith, chief risk officer with Mobius Risk Group in Houston. “I see no issue with U.S. crude going below $100.” U.S. oil settled $1.46 lower at $101.12 a barrel, its lowest since Feb. 14. After two straight days of gains, Brent crude settled 92 cents lower at $108.08. U.S. ultra low-sulfur diesel futures, more commonly known as heating oil, fell 4.5 cents to settle at $2.9674 per gallon. With heating season coming to an end and refiners in maintenance season, traders and analysts expect that oil leaving Cushing will pool along the coast, forcing a temporary glut and capping prices until stocks are drawn down to make gasoline for summer driving season. Oil stocks in the Gulf Coast have risen every week over the last 1-1/2 months. “We will continue to see draws out of Cushing, but I think we will see much larger builds on the Gulf Coast,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member of commodity trading advisor Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. In line with maintenance season, refinery utilization for the week ending March 7 was expected to have fallen, though by less than last week, the preliminary survey showed. The API will release its data on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT), while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT). China released weak data overnight that showed the No. 2 oil consumer’s exports in February fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier. Many risk assets and stock markets fell on the weak data even though it likely reflects a slowdown due to the Lunar New Year holidays. Copper prices hit an eight-month low. Oil traders seemed to put tensions in Ukraine on the back burner, though Russia’s continued push to tighten its grip on  Crimea was expected to keep markets volatile. Brent oil was alternately supported and pressured by the ongoing crisis in Libya that has cut into oil output. Libya’s parliament has ordered that a special force be sent within one week to “liberate” all rebel-held ports in the volatile east, officials said on Monday, raising the stakes over a blockage that has cut off vital oil revenues. Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and might reach full capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

403	  U.S. oil fell by more than $1 per barrel on Monday, pressured by an unexpected fall in China's exports that stoked fears of a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.   Moderating temperatures that will cut the need for heating fuels also weighed on U.S. oil prices. U.S. ultra low-sulfur diesel futures, more commonly known as heating oil, were down 1.5 percent.   Oil on both sides of the Atlantic was pressured as traders unwound some of the risk premium associated with fears of an escalation in tensions in Crimea over the weekend. The crisis in Ukraine had pushed money managers to collect a record number of bullish bets in U.S. oil futures and options last week, U.S. government data showed on Friday.  After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading 50 lower near $108. U.S oil  fell $1.46 to settle at $101.12 per barrel, after touching a session high at $102.82.   U.S. oil's discount to the global benchmark has narrowed by as much as $9 since the beginning of the year as TransCanada's Gulf Coast pipeline has funneled oil from Cushing to the Gulf Coast.   With heating season coming to an end and refiners in maintenance season, traders and analysts expect that oil leaving Cushing will simply pool along the coast, forcing a temporary a glut and capping prices until stocks are drawn down to make gasoline for summer driving season. Oil stocks in the Gulf Coast have risen every week over the last 1.5 months.  For more information on commodities prices, please click here. 	Business
404	" Updated 6:25 p.m. ETStocks drifted to a slightly lower finish Monday as investors sifted through a blend of discouraging economic data from China and Japan as well as ongoing uncertainty over Russia's incursion into Ukraine.Major market indexes pared their losses as the day drew to a close, aided by some high-flying stocks, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Chiquita Brands International and Southwest Airlines.In the absence of U.S. economic data, investors focused on news that China's exports slumped 18 percent in February. The report reinforced fears about the outlook for the world's second-largest economy.In addition, Japan reported a record current account deficit for January and lowered its economic growth estimate for the October-December quarter to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.The reports made for a downbeat start for the market as investors seized the moment to recalibrate their stock holdings.""It was a little bit of an excuse to take some money off the table,"" said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ""We have geopolitical uncertainty, so (it's) a good excuse to re-evaluate your risk exposure. It's going to be par for the course for this year.""The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down 0.87 of a point to close at 1,877.17. It had been down 11 points earlier.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418.68. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.45.The three major U.S. indexes are still up for the month, and only the Dow is down for the year. The S&P 500 ended Monday up 1.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq finished up 3.8 percent.The downbeat economic report from China hurt several industry sectors heavily reliant on Chinese economic growth, in particular, materials, energy and industrials. Six of the 10 sectors of the S&P 500 index ended lower, led by industrials. Mining company Cliffs Natural Resources was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, shedding 70 cents, or 3.8 percent to $17.95.""The market is growing more pessimistic around growth in China,"" said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management. ""Expectations have been coming down, but the numbers have been disappointing even those reduced expectations.""Despite the disappointing data from China, some market watchers anticipate that last week's gains will continue.The S&P 500 index notched record highs three times last week as investors grew more confident that weak U.S. economic reports in recent weeks were a reflection of unusually severe winter weather, not a broad economic slowdown. Better-than-expected payroll numbers last week also helped encourage investors.""In general, I think the market will move past the poor China export numbers fairly quickly,"" said James Liu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. ""There's still a lot of fundamental support for the S&P at this particular range.""Chalupnik also anticipates Monday's decline isn't telling of the market's trajectory for the week ahead, barring more fallout from Russia's deployment of troops in Ukraine.""My guess is the market moves ever so slightly higher this week,"" he said. ""The trend is still up. We really haven't seen anything to break that trend.""Monday marked the fifth anniversary of the current bull market in stocks. The S&P 500 index bottomed out on March 9, 2009, and is up about 177 percent since then. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.This is a light week for market-moving economic data and corporate earnings. But investors will be watching the latest data on retail sales, due out Thursday, and a gauge of consumer confidence due out Friday.""Those two sets of numbers will really tell us where the consumer is and whether or not the consumer will head out and spend when the weather warms up,"" Liu said.Among the stocks bucking the slight downward turn Monday was Alexion Pharmaceuticals.The company climbed the most of any stock in the S&P 500 index, vaulting $11.95, or 7.1 percent, to $180. The company raised its 2014 earnings forecast, saying the national health agency of France will reimburse it for past sales of its drug Soliris.Chiquita was another gainer. It agreed to combine with Dublin-based Fyffes to become the world's top banana company. The stock-for-stock transaction announced Monday creates a global banana and fresh produce company with $4.6 billion in annual revenue. Chiquita rose $1.16, or 10.7 percent, to $12.Southwest Airlines' stock touched a 52-week high of $23.67 early in the day before ending up 50 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $23.60. The carrier got a boost after it reported that passengers are flying more miles, a trend that helped send a key revenue figure higher last month.

lost more than 1% on Monday, as growing concerns over the health of
China's economy dampened demand for riskier assets.
The Asian nation is the world's second largest oil consumer
after the U.S. and has been the engine of strengthening demand.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude for delivery in April fell to a session low of $100.86 a
barrel, the lowest since March 6.makeArticleAd();
WTI crude prices last traded at $101.13 a barrel during U.S.
morning hours, down 1.4%, or $1.45. The April contract rose 1%, or
$1.02 a barrel, on Friday to settle at $102.58.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $100.13 a
barrel, the low from March 6 and resistance at $102.91 a barrel,
the high from March 7.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil
futures for April delivery slumped 1.05%, or $1.16, to trade at
$107.84 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude
contracts stood at $6.71 a barrel.
Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports
collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing
expectations for a 6.8% increase.
Imports rose 10.1%, compared to forecasts for an 8% increase.
According to customs data, China's February crude oil imports
totaled 23.05 million metric tons, down 18.1% from January.
The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of
$22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion
in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in
February.
A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China
rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations,
while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts
for a 1.9% drop.
The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second
largest economy, and overshadowed last Friday's
stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs report for February.
The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, the Labor
Department reported, well above expectations for 149,000 new
jobs.

410	" Pedestrians walk past an electronic board displaying stock prices in  Tokyo. Japan’s Nikkei share average yesterday slipped 153.93 points to  15,120.14 on weak trade data.
AFP/Tokyo
Asian markets tumbled yesterday following a surprisingly poor batch of economic data out of China, while revised Japanese figures showed 2013 growth was slower than expected.
The losses came after healthy gains on most bourses last week and despite jobs growth in the US, while investors are keeping an eye on events in Ukraine as leaders try to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.
Tokyo slipped 1.01%, or 153.93 points, to 15,120.14, Sydney fell 0.93%, or 50.8 points, to 5,411.5 and Seoul was 1.03% lower, giving up 20.26 points, to end at 1,954.42.  Shanghai dived 2.86%, or 58.84 points, to 1,999.07 while Hong Kong sank 1.75%, or 395.56 points, to 22,264.93.
Beijing said on Saturday it had seen an unexpected trade deficit of $22.98bn in February.  The figure compared with a surplus of $14.8bn in the same month last year, and a median forecast of an $11.9bn surplus. Exports fell 18.1% and imports jumped 10.1%.
“It’s hard to ignore a number that looks like that,” said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in Sydney.  Those figures were followed the next day by news that inflation eased to 2% in February, down from 2.5% in January, leading to talk of possible deflation, which could delay much-needed investment and consumer spending.
While authorities blame the country’s holiday season for the weak results, they add to growing worries about the Chinese economy, with the latest surveys on its key manufacturing sector showing weakness. The sell-off yesterday is “symptomatic of the mood of the market to be spooked by any poor China numbers and to only take moderate comfort from strong numbers”, he told Dow Jones Newswires.
In Japan the government said yesterday that gross domestic product growth was 0.2% in the quarter to December and 1.5% through 2013, slower than first thought.  Preliminary figures last month showed GDP expanded 0.3% in October-December period and 1.6% over the year.
While the data still marked Japan’s best annual performance in three years, it will put the focus on the central bank as it begins a policy meeting later in the day, with speculation that it will announce a fresh batch of monetary easing measures.
In currency trade the yen rose after seeing a sell-off for most of last week. In the afternoon the dollar fell to 103.15 yen from 103.24 yen in New York on Friday.
The euro fetched $1.3886 and 143.23 yen, against $1.3874 and 143.31 yen.
In Kuala Lumpur flag-carrier Malaysia Airlines lost 20% at one point after one of its 777 airliners went missing at the weekend with 239 people aboard, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. However, it clawed back a substantial part of that to sit 4% lower in late trade.
The broader market was down 0.50%.
Oil prices fell. New York’s main contract, West Texas Intermediate for April delivery, was down 13 cents at $102.45 and Brent North Sea crude for April fell 82 cents to $108.18.  Gold fetched $1,339.80 an ounce at 1200 GMT compared with $1,348.20 late Friday.
In other markets, Singapore closed down 0.31%, or 9.63 points, at 3,126.63, Bangkok edged down 0.44% or 6.03 points to close at 1,349.05, Jakarta ended down 0.18%, or 8.64 points, at 4,677.25, Kuala Lumpur dipped 0.56%, or 10.20 points, to 1,822.06, Taipei fell 0.56%, or 48.72 points, to 8,665.24, Wellington eased 0.15%, or 7.82 points, to 5,117.84 and Manila ended flat, edging up 5.40 points to 6,487.23.

411	Brent crude oil fell below $109 to start the week on poor data from China, but supply worries helped underpin prices. The commodity traded at $108.01 at 6:00 GMT on Monday morning, as investors evaluated geopolitical tension in both Ukraine and Libya.Bloomberg reported that China released data on Monday showing that the nation's exports unexpectedly fell 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier. The figure was far below economists' expectations of a 7.5 percent increase, though some are blaming the country's Lunar New Year holiday for the disparity. The data compounded the already growing worry that the Chinese economy is slowing down as it followed poor PMI data released last week. However, the ongoing tension in Ukraine kept a floor under Brent prices as Russian forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula over the weekend. Russian forces seized another border post as well as a military airfield over the weekend as pro-Russian leaders moved forward with the country's planned referendum.Related: Euro Holds On To StrengthWestern leaders have said they will not recognize Crimea's independence from Ukraine if the vote does take place on March 16, as it is a direct violation of Ukraine's treaty and international law.However, the Ukrainian government has more pressing problems as its unpaid bills could leave the country without gas. Gazprom has said it may stop sending gas to Ukraine unless the government is able to pay its debts.Tension in Libya also supported Brent prices as armed protesters clashed with the nation's government on Sunday over the sale of oil from a rebel held port. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan warned protesters that the military would bomb a North Korean tanker, which was loaded with $36 million of crude oil if it leaves the county's Es Sider port.Posted-In: Crimea GazpromNews Commodities Forex Global Pre-Market Outlook Markets Best of Benzinga© 2018 Benzinga.com.

And you can join them. It doesn’t matter how old you are, your relationship status, or even how much money you make. There’s simply no way you can be denied from taking part in this plan, too. I’ll show you how here. By Robert Rapier on March 10, 2014Privacy PolicyIntroductionIn last week’s issue of The Energy Letter, I discussed my January prediction that the average natural gas price in the US would be higher this year than last year. While that prediction is looking pretty safe because of the extremely cold winter, I also predicted that “Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices will average less in 2014 than in 2013.” Let’s see how that one is faring.I also predicted lower oil prices for 2013, and ended up being only partially right. In 2013 the average price of Brent crude was 2.8 percent lower than in 2012 with an average of $108.56/barrel (bbl). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was up 4 percent in 2013 to an average daily price of $97.98/bbl. So in 2013 I was right on the direction of Brent, and wrong on the direction of WTI. (I also predicted that the differential between the two would decline, which it did).As I write this, the price of WTI has so far averaged $97.75 this year (only three cents lower than last year’s average), while the price of Brent has averaged $108.55 (a penny below last year’s average). At this point this year’s average is nearly identical to last year’s average. But with WTI presently trading at $102.55 and Brent at $109 it won’t take long for average prices to rise above my prediction.The Argument for Lower PricesGiven the rapid expansion of oil production in the US, it is certainly possible that local supplies could temporarily outstrip demand in the short term, or that temporary logistical constraints could develop. Either of these factors would favor lower short-term WTI pricing. In fact, this is reflected somewhat in the price differential between WTI and Brent.Until 2010 WTI generally traded at a slight premium to Brent, but the rapid rise in oil production in the US and the logistical constraints in getting that oil to market have had it trading at a discount since. That discount has at times exceeded $20/bbl, which has been very fortunate for oil refiners.While there is still a federal ban in place on crude oil exports, refiners can export finished products. These finished products — fuels like gasoline and diesel — are generally priced based on Brent. So refiners can buy crude at WTI prices and sell finished products at Brent prices. A general rule of thumb I use is that when the Brent-WTI spread is over $10/bbl, quarterly results for refiners will be pretty good. If the spread is $20, results will be fantastic.So even though growing US production is reflected in the WTI discount, the price of oil is still hovering around $100/bbl despite many predictions that prices would soften. In fact, a year ago analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggested oil could fall to $50/bbl within two years, and Ed Morse at Citi expects crude prices to average $80/bbl through 2020. At the other end of the spectrum Oswald Clint at Sanford Bernstein projects nearly double that price at $158 a barrel in 2020.Demand Keeps PaceWhy have oil prices remained so stubbornly high, despite huge increases in US oil production? In a nutshell, it’s the demand side of the equation keeping pace with the growing supply. Over the past decade, demand in the US and the EU fell, but this was more than compensated for by growing demand in developing countries. This kept the price of oil high, despite supply/demand fundamentals that in isolated countries would have encouraged lower prices.But the world’s oil markets aren’t local. And now demand in the US is starting to regain strength, recently rising to the highest level since 2008. The International Energy Agency has estimated that global demand for oil will increase this year by 1.2 million barrels a day. For perspective, over the past five years the world has increased oil production by nearly 3.9 million barrels (2 million of which was from the US) — an average increase each year of 770,000 barrels per year.So the increase in oil production has been gobbled up by an energy hungry world just as fast as crude could come out of the ground, and that trend is likely to continue long-term. Nevertheless, the easing of sanctions on Iran, the continued growth of oil production in Iraq, and another year of expansion for the US oil industry could combine to oversupply the market in the short term. This may be offset, however, by deteriorating events in Venezuela and Libya.ConclusionsFor now, investors in natural gas companies can be happy that my natural gas prediction is proving to be correct, but investors in oil companies can also be happy that my prediction for lower oil prices hasn’t yet materialized.In any event, I believe the long-term direction for both commodities is inevitably higher prices, so while I still expect a sideways to slightly negative direction for oil prices over the next couple of years, over the long haul this sector will continue to deliver.(Follow Robert Rapier on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook.) Most folks understand the basic concept of inflation… things cost more money. But tragically, most don’t understand the real implications of what it means for their financial future. Or just how dangerous it’s becoming right now. Today.And there are two reasons for that…First, the U.S. government’s calculations barely take into account two of the things you and I are paying more and more for every day: energy and food.Second, since inflation really hasn’t been an issue for the past 30 years here in the U.S., most analysts won’t dare to say it’s on the rise because they’ll suffer professionally. But I’ve made a name for myself by always saying what needs to be said. Which is why I’ve prepared a new special report that’ll give you simple instructions on how to protect yourself from the coming storm.And better still…It gives you the full story on the six types of investments that are destined to soar 275%… 375%… even up to 575% over the next few years as the winds of inflation flatten the U.S. economy.You can get your free copy here.Our Stock Talk section is reserved for productive dialogue pertaining to the content and portfolio recommendations of this service.

The process changes he implemented saved the facility $9 million a year. He later worked as the Engineering Director for a Dutch environmental-technology company and provided engineering support for a Chinese facility the company was constructing.Robert was also a butanol engineer in Germany for the Celanese Corporation, where he designed a novel butanol unit that cut production costs by $5 million per year.In all, Robert has spent more than a dozen years working on liquid fuels technologies. Along the way he's picked up five patents, including one for a breakthrough way to convert ethane into ethylene (U.S. Patent 7,074,977).Now, in addition to guiding readers to timely energy plays in his twice-monthly Energy Strategist, Robert travels the world evaluating startup energy companies for deep-pocketed investors. After grilling management and assessing the technology on-site, he makes a go/no-go investment decision. His wealthy private investors and hedge fund backers trust him to make the right choice for the same reason we do: his vast real-world experience in just about every facet of the energy industry. If Robert votes thumbs-up, millions of dollars flow into these cutting-edge outfits.Robert earned his master of science in chemical engineering and a bachelor of science in chemistry and mathematics (double major) at Texas A&M University. He tells us he was ""this close"" to finishing his Ph.D. before he decided he was having a lot more fun making money in energy stocks.A prolific writer, Robert's articles have appeared in Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and the Christian Science Monitor -- and he has been a featured expert on 60 Minutes and The History Channel. His new book, Power Plays: Energy Options in the Age of Peak Oil (Apress, 2012), helps investors sort through doom and gloom, hype and misinformation to understand the true costs, benefits and trade-offs for each of our major energy options.In what little spare time he has left, Robert consults for a number of energy projects, including biodiesel, ethanol, butanol and biomass gasification facilities.Your guide to understanding and profiting from the major trends, industry news and worldwide events that are driving the market and impacting your investments.Want to know about the high-yield global income stock I found this week?

428	4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped below $108 a barrel on Monday as an unexpected fall in China’s exports stoked fears of a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy, though geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya limited the decline. The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction. Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers. After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82. “We’ve seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited,” said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache. “There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn’t happened.” Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region’s future. Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe. “We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine,” said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility.” Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment. Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4. Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack. At the same time, Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon. Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February. Prices were under pressure even though China’s crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.

The Energy Report 3/10/14
Monday, March 10, 2014
by Phil Flynn of The PRICE Futures GroupChina Trade OffsA big drop in China exports has the commodity complex fearing demand destruction drops more than geo-political risk. Forget about Ukraine, Libya, a strong US Jobs report or the possibility of a terrorist blowing up a Jet from Malaysia, it is about China in the early trade. Chinese exports plunged tanked by a shocking 18.1% leading to a 23 billion dollar trade deficit. The markets are trying to adjust to a shaky new Lunar New Year.  Oh sure some blame the holiday but after getting one China company default it is possible that China is headed towards a very hard landing.The reason why this is so shocking is just one month ago China trade expanded by 10.6%. We saw copper imports were soaring. Still China Copper Imports were up January through February was up 41.2% but in February fell 29%. It looks like copper buyers loaded up on supply fearing what tradersChina’s consumer prices rose 2% in February at their slowest rate in 13 months. So it does give some room to stimulate if need be but one of the reason prices fell was pork prices fell by 9%. Pork prices are again on the rise as the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus is devastated the US pig crop. Producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month by dropping 2 percent, slightly above forecasts for a 1.9 percent drop leading to more concerns that China is having a hard time keeping things together.Add to that Japan revised down its growth estimate for the final three months of last year after announcing a record current account deficit for January. Japan’s Cabinet Office said both private and public demand was lower than its earlier estimate.Reuters is reporting that armed protesters in eastern Libya traded threats with the government on Sunday in a tense stand-off over the unauthorized sale of oil from a rebel-held port. A North Korean-flagged tanker, the Morning Glory, docked on Saturday at the port of Es Sider and local daily al-Wasat said it had loaded $36 million of crude oil. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said the military will bomb the 37,000-tonne vessel if it tries to leave.Officials said on Sunday that the navy and pro-government militias had dispatched boats to stop it from getting out. The rebels said any attack on the tanker would be “a declaration of war.” The escalating conflict over the country’s oil wealth is a sign of mounting chaos in Libya, where the government has failed to rein in fighters who helped oust veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and who now defy state authority.The protesters, who also include former soldiers and ex-oil guards led by a former anti-Gaddafi commander, Ibrahim Jathran, have seized three eastern ports in the OPEC member country. The Defense Ministry issued orders to the chief of staff, air force and navy to deal with the tanker. “The order authorizes the use of force and puts the responsibility for any resulting damage on the ship owner,” it said in a statement.  “Several navy boats have been dispatched. Now the tanker’s movements are under complete control and nobody can move it,” said Culture Minister Habib al-Amin, who acts as informal government spokesman. “The tanker will stay where it is. “All efforts are being undertaken to stop and seize the tanker, if necessary by a (military) strike, if it does not follow orders,” he said, adding that state prosecutors would treat the loading of the crude as smuggling. There was no sign of any immediate military action, but Libyan news websites showed some small boats close to a tanker which they said was the Morning Glory. Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi’s overthrow, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled him.Well at least the break in the price of oil may break gas prices that have been on the rise. Trilby Lundberg reported that the average U.S. price per gallon for regular gasoline is now almost $3.51, the highest since last September. Diesel fuel prices also rose, increasing by 2.58 cents from two weeks earlier to an average $4.0323 per gallon. The blame goes to higher “ethanol” prices, stemming in part from the unrest in Ukraine. Corn is a major export for the Ukraine and a rally in Corn and a drought in Brazil have grains hopping. Corn is pulling back a bit.  According to the survey, the lowest average price for a gallon of unleaded gas in the U.S. is $3.18 in Jackson, Mississippi.

The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of
$22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion

A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China
rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations,

Markets in mainland China and in Hong Kong came under heavy

China Minsheng Bank slumped 1.5% and 2.5%.

444	Reuters Staff2 Min ReadSINGAPORE, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures slipped in early Asian trade on Monday, as data showing an unexpected fall in China’s exports added to fears of a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy, stoking demand growth concerns. But worries over supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and north African exporter Libya limited falls. U.S. oil dropped 20 cents to $102.35 a barrel by 0048, after touching a high of $102.82. It rose to an intra-day high of $102.91 a barrel on Friday before settling up $1.02. Brent crude fell 37 cents to $108.63 a barrel, after ending 90 cents higher. * China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide. * Armed protesters in eastern Libya traded threats with the government on Sunday in a tense stand-off over the unauthorised sale of oil from a rebel-held port. * Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution. * U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus. * Asian stocks slipped in early trade on Monday and the dollar stepped back from its recent highs as disappointing Chinese trade data and uncertainty over the crisis in Ukraine kept risk appetite in check.

446	"Mar 10, 2014 04:15 PM EDTDespite the boom seen in the fastfood business industry, Sbarro counts itself as one of the few who were unable to capitalize on the growth trend. According to a Forbes newsmagazine report, the fastfood restaurant chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in less than three years the company had filed for the first time. The company also showed trouble brewing this year when it announced on February that it will be shuttering 155 of its 400 restaurants across North America. Forbes said that the bankruptcy news will  not affect the the 600 stores owned by franchisees.Restaurant consultant and president Michael Whiteman of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York said that the latest development at the pizza chain was inevitable. He told Reuters, ""Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model. Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order. I don't know that it has a sustainable business over the longer term. The way to turn the company around in the short haul is to get out of money-losing leases and close stores, which it has been doing.""Founded by Italian immigrants Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro in 1956, Forbes said the company grew to a 799-store firm across 40 countries and employs over 2,700 people. Majority of its stores in the US are located in malls, where it has been observed that foot traffic and food court spending has slowed down.In its court filing, Sbarro reported $175.4 million in assets and $165.2 million in liabilities, Reuters said. The pizza chain plans to shed $140 million of secured debt in the reorganization, and has tapped advisers, which include Moelis & Co, Loughlin Management and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis to help them with the process.Chief Executive David Karam had said about the bankruptcy filing, ""The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step.""The news agency said that Sbarro filed for bankruptcy protection in April less than three years ago and emerged the following November.You have already subscribed.

448	" NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pizza chain Sbarro LLC has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years after struggling with too much debt and fewer customers in malls that house many of its restaurants. Lenders would take control of the Melville, New York-based company under a ""pre-packaged"" Chapter 11 reorganization, which Sbarro on Monday said could allow it to made a ""quick exit"" from bankruptcy before May 7. Sbarro expects to cut its debt load by more than 80 percent, and said nearly all its lenders support its restructuring, which requires court approval. The company will invite other buyers to submit better offers. Founded in 1956, Sbarro had tried to boost sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor ""fast casual"" chains such as Chipotle and Panera Bread. But an ""unprecedented decline in mall traffic"" and an ""unsustainable"" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, including the closure of hundreds of restaurants, Chief Financial Officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing. ""Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model,"" said Michael Whiteman, a restaurant consultant and president of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York. ""Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order."" The company said it recently closed more than 180 money-losing restaurants, and expects to shed about 50 more locations. It said it now has 799 restaurants in over 40 countries, employing more than 2,700 people. Sbarro said the bankruptcy does not affect the 582 restaurants owned by franchisees. Last month, the company announced plans to close 155 of its 400 company-owned restaurants in North America. Sbarro was founded in Brooklyn by Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro, a married couple who had immigrated from Naples, Italy. It expanded in the New York City area before launching in 1967 its typical restaurant format, which includes an open kitchen and lets customers serve themselves. NECESSARY STEP Sbarro and 33 affiliates filed for protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The company reported assets of $175.4 million and liabilities of $165.2 million. It plans to shed $140 million of secured debt in the reorganization. Advisers include Moelis & Co, Loughlin Management and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Sbarro previously filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011, and emerged from Chapter 11 the following November. ""The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step,"" Chief Executive David Karam said. Karam joined Sbarro last March from the hamburger chain Wendy's Co , where he was a president. Whiteman said Sbarro may face an uphill struggle. ""I don't know that it has a sustainable business over the longer term,"" he said. ""The way to turn the company around in the short haul is to get out of money-losing leases and close stores, which it has been doing.""

450	"Sbarro LLC, the pizza restaurant chain operator filed for a bankruptcy protection after the company incurred too much debt and experienced customer declines at its restaurants that are primarily located in shopping malls.According to the Wall Street Journal, Sbarro’s lenders for a debt equity swap supported its intention to file for bankruptcy protection. The pizza restaurant chain operator submitted its chapter 11 bankruptcy application on Monday morning. This is the second bankruptcy protection filed by the company in less than three years.Sbarro indicated that 98% of its lenders voted in favor of the prepackaged plan, which allows them to exchange $140 million in debt to gain control of the reorganized company. Its CEO David Karam said the company’s agreement with lenders indicates their “support and confidence” to the growth strategies developed by the new management over the past nine months.The group of lenders agreed to provide $20 million bankruptcy loan to Sbarro to finance its chapter 11 restructuring.The pizza restaurant chain operator announced its plan to close 155 out of its 400 restaurants in North America last month as part of its initiative to reduce costs.Sbarro’s prepackaged plan indicated that a combination of store closures and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability. The company also believed that the strategy will help reduces its outstanding debt by over 80%.In addition, Sbarro will also put its business up for auction to test the debt-swap to ensure maximize recoveries for creditors. The company emphasized that it will immediately seek a confirmation for standalone reorganization if it does not receive better offers for its business.Sbarro used its last stay in bankruptcy to reduce 70% of its liabilities. The company’s existing debt is $130 million, down from $400 million.In the latter part of 2011, Sbarro emerged from its first chapter 11 bankruptcy after a debt-for-equity swap with lenders. It has 800 stores across 40 countries. Its current bankruptcy protection does not affect the 600 franchise locations worldwide. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.enter your info below & be subscribed to bothvaluewalk & valueinvestor.com (from ValueWalk)

            By Bob Carltonbcarlton@al.comThe national pizza chain Sbarro -- which has locations in shopping malls and outlet centers in Birmingham,   Huntsville and Florence -- has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years, Reuters news service reported earlier today.Sbarro is struggling with too much debt and with fewer customers in the malls that house many of its restaurants, according to the Reuters report.Under a ""pre-packaged"" Chapter 11 reorganization, the Melville, N.Y.-based company should make a ""quick exit"" from bankruptcy before May 7, the company said today, according to Reuters.Founded in 1956, Sbarro has tried to increase sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor other fast-casual restaurant chains, Reuters reported.An ""unprecedented decline in mall traffic"" and an ""unsustainable"" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, Sbarro chief financial officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing.Sbarro has locations at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, at the Outlet Shops of Grand River in Leeds, at Parkway Place in Huntsville and at Regency Square Mall in Florence, according to the company's website.It is not yet known how Sbarro's bankruptcy will affect those locations, but according to Reuters, the company said it recently closed more than 180 restaurants, and expects to close about 50 more. The bankruptcy will not affect 582 locations that are owned by franchisees.To read the full Reuters report, click here.

460	"Sbarro LLC, the 800-restaurant U.S. pizza chain, filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years as customer traffic slowed in the shopping-mall food courts where many of its stores do business.The company listed assets and debt of as much as $500 million each in a Chapter 11 petition filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Melville, New York-based Sbarro said in a statement that it will use court protection to quickly reorganize and close many underperforming stores under a plan already supported by holders of most of its debt.“The agreement among the company’s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Karam said in the statement.A group of lenders will provide $20 million in financing, and the reorganization plan will eliminate $140 million in debt, Sbarro said. The filing won’t affect its 600 franchises worldwide.The Sbarro family started the company 58 years ago after moving to Brooklyn, New York, from Naples, Italy. MidOcean Partners LP acquired Sbarro in January 2007 for $417 million. The chain reported losses in 2008 on higher costs for ingredients such as cheese, flour and pasta and filed for bankruptcy in 2011.Overseas ExpansionKaram, previously an executive at fast-food chain Wendy’s Co., led a comeback effort after joining Sbarro as CEO in 2013. To offset slow growth in the U.S., where muted consumer spending took a toll on Sbarro’s stores, the company opened 81 new locations overseas in 2013. In February, it closed 155 stores in North America.Restaurant chains including Bennigan’s and Steak & Ale, both owned by Metromedia Restaurant Group, and Buffets Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy in the three years before Sbarro’s 2011 filing, hurt by the worst U.S. economic slump since the Great Depression.Uno Restaurant Holdings Corp., also a pizza chain, entered bankruptcy in January 2010. Midland Food Services LLC, the operator of 92 Pizza Hut restaurants in six states, and Commissary Operations Inc., a distributor of food and supplies to chains, also sought court protection.First BankruptcySbarro’s first trip through bankruptcy began in April 2011 and ended in November of that year. Under that reorganization, first-lien lenders gained ownership and the company eliminated 70 percent of its debt. The earlier Chapter 11 filing listed assets of $471 million and debt of $486.6 million.Unsecured creditors with as much as $173 million in claims got nothing in the first bankruptcy, as an auction drew no bids and was canceled.Standard & Poor’s said in July that Sbarro’s debt was unsustainable after it borrowed to fund cash operating losses. S&P; called the pizza market fragmented and competitive. Sbarro is also vulnerable to declines in shopping-mall traffic and the volatility of ingredient prices, the ratings company said.Related Coverage• NJ retailer Ashley Stewart files for bankruptcy, will close 27 stores

The Daily Caller

The Daily CallerThe Sbarro pizza restaurant chain filed for bankruptcy court protection Monday, less than three weeks after it was forced to close more than 40% of its U.S. locations.In a statement Monday the chain said the bankruptcy filing is a pre-packaged plan, which means that it has already agreed on a reorganization plan with creditors that hold 98% of the company’s debt. That should allow it to quickly shed an estimated $140 million in debt, and emerge from bankruptcy as a healthier company.It is the second bankruptcy filing in less than three years by the chain, which previously filed for bankruptcy in April 2011.Full Story: Pizza chain Sbarro files for bankruptcy

Another fast-food chain finds itself on the ropes. For the second time in less than three years, Sbarro  filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday.
	Last month, the pizza chain said it will close 155 of its estimated 400 restaurants in North America, in a cost-cutting move. Bankruptcy court papers, quoted by Reuters, say the Melville, N.Y.-based company has between $100 million and $500 million in assets and liabilities.
	But even with the closures, Sbarro would still have more than 800 outlets in over 40 countries.
	The company previously filed for Chapter 11 in April of 2011, and emerged from bankruptcy in November of that year.
Related: Mt. Gox Files For U.S. Chapter 15 Bankruptcy
	According to the Wall Street Journal, the company went ahead with its latest Chapter 11 filing after finding support for a debt-equity swap from its lenders. The WSJ also quotes a statement from Sbarro CEO David Karam – who described the deal as indicating the lenders' “support and confidence they have in the growth strategies"" developed by Sbarro's new management team.
	Karam became Sbarro's chief executive last March – replacing James Greco, who resigned after a year as CEO.
	Word about Sbarro comes on the heel of reports that another fast-food chain, Quiznos, is preparing to file for bankruptcy. In a recent commentary, Fitch Ratings said both Quiznos and Sbarro “reflect the difficulties faced by brands that have lost their competitive position and relevancy with consumers.”
	It also noted there was a “repeated theme” when it comes to restaurant chain bankruptcies – of companies using the Chapter 11 process to restructure or reject their operating leases in an effort to trim costs, while at the same time being protected from their creditors.
	“Restaurants often take the opportunity to close unprofitable locations and typically emerge as smaller chains,” the commentary continued. “Restaurants also try to improve profitability in bankruptcy through the sale or licensing of trademarks and other intellectual property”Posted-In: Analyst Color News Wall Street Journal Restaurants Events Economics Analyst Ratings Media Best of Benzinga© 2018 Benzinga.com.

470	"It may be boom times for some restaurant chains, like stars Chipotle and Panera Bread, but don't count Sbarro among those benefiting from the fast casual trend.The fast food pizza chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years after it tried and failed to boost sales by revamping its menu and shuttering its worst-performing restaurants. In February, Sbarro said it would close 155 out of the 400 restaurants it owns in North America, though it still has more than 800 locations abroad and about 600 owned by franchisees (the latter will not be affected by the bankruptcy).In its 2011 bankruptcy, the company slashed 80% of its $400 million debt load. This time, it wants to cut another $140 million worth of debt. While Sbarro is inviting other parties to submit offers to buy the company, its main lenders voted to support a ""pre-packaged"" plan to exchange the debt for control of a reorganized Sbarro.“The agreement among the company’s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months.  The Board and Senior Management Team are committed to ensuring Sbarro’s future growth and success and today’s filing is a necessary step to achieve those goals,” Sbarro CEO David Karam said in a statement.
Sbarro's US restaurants are mainly located in malls, where foot traffic has slowed and food court spending is down.

The company cites declining traffic in mall food courts where it does much of its business. NEW YORK — Sbarro has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization for the second time in just three years as the pizza chain struggles to turn its business around amid a drop in traffic at shopping mall food courts.The bankruptcy filing on Monday comes after the company shuttered 155 of its U.S. locations last month. The Melville, N.Y., company still has about 800 locations globally, half of those in North America.The pizza chain isn’t alone in hurting from the decline in traffic at shopping malls. Earlier this year, the owner of Hot Dot on a Stick also filed for bankruptcy protection, citing the negative impact from the trend.There is one Sbarro location in Maine, at the Kennebunk Travel Plaza at Mile 25 on Interstate 95. There previously were locations at both the Maine Mall and Bangor Mall, but both have shuttered.Sbarro is working to balance out its portfolio of mall-based stores with a new concept called “Pizza Cucinova” that lets people build their own pizzas, company spokesman Jonathan Dedmon said in an email. There are two locations of the new restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, and a third planned for Cincinnati in the summer, Dedmon said.Sbarro is also trying to update its image for serving re-heated pizza at a time when people are increasingly reaching for foods they feel are fresh and wholesome. Dedmon said the chain has been “emphasizing freshness and quality” of its pizza.Sbarro first filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain’s image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn’t take hold.The company says its latest strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will slash debt by more than 80 percent and improve its profitability. It said its filing is designed to “allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy” as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.

            Published: March 10 2014
        After closing 155 of its corporate-run locations, the Long Island-based pizza chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it tries to settle $500 million in debt.
Sbarro LLC, the Melville-headquartered pizza chain originally based out of Brooklyn has filed for bankruptcy for the second time in three years. A common sight in malls and airports across America, the chain closed down 155 of its corporate-owned US locations last month in an effort to return to profitability and has now petitioned a US Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for Chapter 11 in hopes that it will be able to quickly settle some of its $500 million debt; the company also listed its total assets around the $500 million mark.
Holders of the company’s debt have already expressed support for the filing, and a group of lenders will provide $20 million in financing as Sbarro attempts to reorganize and cut away at $140 million of the money it owes according to Bloomberg News.
“The agreement among the company’s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months,” said Chairman and CEO David Karam. Karam was previously an executive at Wendy’s before joining Sbarro in March of 2013.
The bankruptcy will not impact the pizza chain’s 600 global franchises, nor were any of the February closures stores run by franchise operators. Long Island saw three of its seven Sbarro locations shut down due to underperformance. Food court locations in Broadway Mall, Green Acres Mall, and Sunrise Mall were all shuttered; the Smithaven Mall location is still open, as are the two Mama Sbarro locations in Hauppauge and Deer Park, and the Sbarro-owned Umberto’s of Huntington. 220 company-run locations remain open in the US.
Sbarro previously filed for bankruptcy in April 2011 and began to report losses in 2008 due to the rising cost of ingredients such as flour, pasta, and cheese. During that first bankruptcy the chain was able to eliminate 70% of its debt and emerge from Chapter 11 by November of the same year. Despite the company’s troubles in the United States, it opened 81 new locations around the world last year.

Park)We told you last week that mediocre pizza-slinger and mall mainstay Sbarro would likely be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Today, it made that filing official, making this the second bankruptcy for Sbarro since the spring of 2011.(J.G. Park)The pizza chain has some $140 million in debt to lenders. According to the Wall Street Journal, the bankruptcy plan would hand over control of the company to the creditors in exchange for wiping away that red ink. The lenders involved in the deal will also provide a $20 million bankruptcy loan to aid in restructuring the chain that has faltered in the face of increased competition and decreased foot traffic to the malls that have called Sbarro home for decades. Sbarro will also be put on the auction block to see if anyone is willing to buy the beleaguered restaurant chain. The bankruptcy comes on the heels of a recent announcement to shutter 155 of the remaining 400 Sbarro locations in North America. There are another 600 Sbarro locations outside of North America that are unaffected by this filing. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was able to substantially reduce its debt from $400 million to its current level.3.10.14By Chris Morran@themorrancaveremember the '80s? sbarro bankruptcy pizzaPart of Founded in 2005, Consumerist® is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports."

481	Sbarro’s, the pizza chain for hungry travelers and mall shoppers, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday, its second time in less than three years. Sbarro’s and its affiliates have between $100 million and $500 million in debt, according to court filings. The company previously filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was working its way out of debt. In February, the New York-based pizza chain said it was closing more than 150 stores nationwide in a bid to improve its finances. The company faces a problem plaguing many retailers: dwindling mall traffic. Many of its stores are located in shopping-center food courts. The number of people shopping at malls has dropped during the past decade as Americans increasingly shop online. Earlier this year, RadioShack, Staples, J.C. Penney and Macy’s announced that they were closing locations around the country.Sbarro’s, including franchises, has more than 1,000 locations in 45 countries.

Sbarro also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain’s image by touting new recipes and ovens. But the efforts apparently didn’t take hold.



Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent. It said its filing is designed to “allow for a quick exit from bankruptcy” as it executes a broader plan developed by the new management team.


Sbarro had cited declining traffic in the mall food courts, where it does much of its business, for the closures. The company did not immediately provide details on whether any marketing or in-store changes were planned to help update its image and boost sales.


It says it still has more than 800 locations worldwide.

485	"Pizza chain Sbarro files for bankruptcy protection [Reuters]Sbarro LLC, the pizza restaurant chain, on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years, after struggling with too much debt and lower customer traffic in the malls that house many of its restaurants. Sbarro and more than 30 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.For I.R.S. Chief, a Challenge Too Big to Pass Up [NYT]In today’s bitterly polarized environment, the Internal Revenue Service has become even more of a whipping boy for United States politicians as it struggles with deep budget cuts and accusations of incompetence and, some say, illegal actions. It’s the ideal situation for John Koskinen. A year ago, the top White House aides Jeff Zients and Gene Sperling talked to Mr. Koskinen about a job in the Obama administration. He demurred, though he told them to call if they had something disastrous that no one else wanted to manage. They did; he says it took him “about 15 seconds” to accept the job of I.R.S. commissioner.In IRS Scandal, Begging Is Not an Action Plan [American Thinker]Yet the conservative response to the IRS scandal consists mainly of begging the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute and begging the IRS to start playing nice by releasing information implicating its own staff in wrongdoing and perhaps criminal violations. Like that’s gonna happen. Begging is not a plan of action. As a lawyer, the author must point out that lawyers leading conservative organizations are failing to implement the proven techniques already developed by Judicial Watch when Bill Clinton was president. The “whine and cheese party” is not the right way to achieve the results that justice demands. And all Americans are at risk from how this is being handled.PwC buys Biond Consulting [Advisor.ca]Meanwhile, in Canada…Hackers Hit Mt.

So another group of hackers say they’ve broken into the company’s servers to provide answers of their own.KPMG global chairman speaks about insider trading fiasco [Attestation Update]By the way, here’s another minor consequence for Mr. London – watch how Adrienne Gonzalez has redefined his name.

The shopping mall pizza chain Sbarro has filed for bankruptcy protection and will close 155 stores across North America in order to cut labor costs.This is the second time in three years that Sbarro has filed for bankruptcy protection, due to lower customer traffic in the malls and a growing pile of debt.Sbarro pizza files for bankruptcy protection. Image Courtesy: WikipediaSbarro and its company affiliates filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws permit businesses more time to reorganize assets and offers them a chance to restructure their business in order to pay off the debts, unless the companys debt exceeds its assets.  In most cases the trustee or creditor is given empowerment to operate the debtors business, till the debtor can lower its debt or come up with a plan to liquidate its assets.The pizza company based out of New York has around $100 million and $500 million in both assets and liabilities, according to court papers.Sbarro has continually struggled with with high food, labor and occupancy costs, according to Moody investors.Despite the store closures across North America Sbarro will still have more than 800 stores worldwide, including those owned by franchisers.Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro founded the pizza chain in 1956, after moving to the United States from Italy. The company originally started out as a small Italian grocery store that sold pizza by the slice, before becoming popular and opening up pizza restaurants in malls across America.Sbarro previously applied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in, April 2011, after listing assets of $471 million and debt of $486.6 million. In 2011 it was the fifth largest pizza chain in America, according to Pizza Today.The pizza chain was granted court approval to emerge from bankruptcy under a plan requiring restructuring and ceding ownership to lenders.Now the franchised company is forced yet again to file for bankruptcy protection due to its poor financial situation.Sbarro Pizza Closing 155 Stores To Protect From Going Bankrupt.  "	Business

495	Update, November 2013: Robert Nickelsberg's work from Afghanistan has been compiled into a new monograph, Aghanistan: A Distant War, published by Prestel. For more information on the book, author signings and related multimedia presentations visit afghanistan.robertnickelsberg.com.Afghanistan is a hard place to enter and even harder to leave. Everything in Afghanistan, the geography, the weather, the tribesmen, all conspire to keep out unwanted visitors. And once you’re inside this labyrinth of stone, it’s nearly impossible to find your way out. Dust storms besiege Kabul’s airport, blizzards close the mountain passes and bandits or Taliban fighters (it’s hard to tell them apart) ambush the roads.Ask the British how hard it is to leave Afghanistan. During their infamous retreat from Kabul in 1842, only one survivor out of 17,500 soldiers and camp followers staggered out of the Kabul Gorge alive. Ask the Soviets, who fared nearly as badly. And if history is any judge, the Americans won’t face an easy departure, either.Photojournalist Robert Nickelsberg has also found it impossible to leave. Since he first trekked into Afghanistan with the mujahedin in 1988, Nickelsberg keeps going back. He does so out of curiosity, duty and obsession. He was there for the Soviets’ withdrawal—flowers for tank gunners until the Red Army rumbled into the hairpins of the Hindu Kush and fell prey to ambush. He was there for the vicious civil war that broke out when the Soviet-backed regime fell apart in 1992 and Afghanistan’s ethnic groups, the Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks turned snarling on each other. (And may do so again, after NATO forces depart.)Nickelsberg was there for the Taliban’s conquest of Afghanistan, their swift fall after the U.S.-led invasion and the Taliban’s rise again. “The Americans didn’t grasp how complex this is,” Nickelsberg says, “The soldiers come and go so fast they barely have time to figure out where the sun rises and sets.”His photos bear witness to that complexity, to the savage beauty of Afghanistan and its people. His photos are spare, intense. Every image is stripped down to the essential drama, and in doing so Nickelsberg illuminates the pivotal moments in Afghanistan’s chronology of  war and the brief, quiet moments in between, when Afghans catch their breath.When I first ventured into Afghanistan in 1990, I sought out Nickelsberg, thinking, unwisely, that he would keep me from getting shot at. It was quite the reverse. Nickelsberg reacts to gunfire like a bird dog to the rustle of quail. He led me straight into the Kabul Gorge, where in my imagination, ghosts from the British massacre flitted in the ravine’s bottomless shadows and menace was ever-present. Nickelsberg was looking for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, one of Afghanistan’s more sadistic, and enduring, warlords. Luckily, we didn’t find Hekmatyar’s cutthroats that day, though a year later they would murder my Afghan translator. Following Nickelsberg into dangerous situations, mortar barrages, gun-battles, sieges and ambushes, became a pattern for the next 16 years of my life while I covered Afghanistan. He would get us into jams but he would always know how to get us out. Nickelsberg has longer legs than I do but, in retreat, I always out-ran him.Many journalists love to dress up like Afghans, with the long tunic, the baggy pantaloons and the flat woolen caps known as pakools. They’re like giddy children going off to a costume party. Not Nickelsberg. He dresses for war as if going for a brisk walk in the Vermont hills, his hair as clipped as a military officer’s, perfectly parted. In the midst of Afghanistan’s chaos, Nickelsberg always kept his composure, his flinty style. And this reflects in his photography: there is a sharpness to his composition, a rigorous clarity.Most photographers are captivated by swift light, motion and color, which Afghanistan has aplenty. But Nickelsberg stuck around. He bothered to learn about the people he portrays so keenly, the reasons why they laugh and cry—and kill. His photos aren’t just war and gore—though, undeniably, that’s part of Afghan history—but also the quotidian. Two shots in particular, young men dancing at a picnic in Babur’s gardens and warrior Ahmed Shah Masood sitting with his companions, have the delicacy of Mogul miniatures.Nicklesberg’s hard-won knowledge of Afghanistan gives a rare depth to his photos. He wasn’t just snapping a pretty picture. He knew he was capturing Afghanistan’s history, and ours.Robert Nickelsberg was a TIME magazine contract photographer for 25 years and was based in New Delhi from 1988 to 2000.  During that time, he documented conflicts in Kashmir, Iraq, Sri Lanka, India and Afghanistan. Currently represented by Getty Images, he is working on publishing a book of his photographs from Afghanistan.Tim McGirk, a former TIME bureau chief, has been covering Afghanistan on and off since 1990, when he first ventured in with photojournalist Robert Nickelsberg. McGirk is currently managing editor of the University of California at Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program.	Business

504	Reuters Staff5 Min Read* South Stream talks on hold politically * Bulgaria says South Stream still needs to be built * Permission to feed more Nord Stream gas into EU also delayed * Europe seeks long-term alternatives to Russian gas   (Adds detail throughout) By Vera Eckert and Barbara Lewis FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - Brussels dealt a blow on Monday to two major Russian pipeline projects to supply natural gas to Europe, in the latest sign of strains in the energy links between Moscow and the European Union. Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region has already shaken political relations between Russia and the European Union. In Brussels, the crisis is likely to intensify efforts to reduce energy dependence on Russia, while Moscow has long sought to curb its reliance on Ukraine as the main pipeline route for shipping Russian gas to Europe, its biggest market. Russia has begun building the South Stream pipeline project to carry up to 15 percent of Europe’s annual gas demand via the Black Sea by 2018. But the pipeline still lacks important approvals to comply with EU legislation, including obtaining exemptions from rules that limit pipeline ownership and require access be provided to other gas firms or utilities. The European Commissioner for Energy, Guenther Oettinger, told German newspaper Die Welt on Monday that discussions with Russia on the link were suspended. “I won’t accelerate talks about pipelines such as South Stream for the time being; they will be delayed,” Oettinger, a German national, was quoted as saying. Commission spokeswoman Sabine Berger said he was referring only to political talks but said he had made clear that South Stream faces a long wait for legal clearance. The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies warned on Monday that there was “a strong possibility” of a reduction of EU-Russian energy cooperation, which would have substantial economic costs for Europe. If that happens, the institute said that “the military and political crisis over Crimea and the change of Ukrainian government had catalysed an additional crisis in EU-Russia relations, in the gas sphere”. Bulgaria, one of the European nations almost totally dependent on Russian gas, said on Monday that South Stream remained of “substantial significance” to Europe and therefore should be built despite the current crisis. One of Russia’s existing alternative routes to supply western Europe without passing Ukraine, the Nord Stream Pipeline, was also hit on Monday. Introduced in 2011, Nord Stream pumps gas from Russia via the Baltic Sea into Germany. But the pipeline is underused, and Russia’s Gazprom  says it could pump more if EU rules allowed it full access to the Opal pipeline project, which aims to link northeastern Germany, where Nord Stream makes landfall, to the Czech Republic. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January the Commission had agreed to allow Russia 100 percent access. But an EU spokeswoman said the executive had delayed a decision on this access, which was initially expected on Monday, citing a need for technical clarification. “The Commission aims for rapid clarification of the remaining issues and will work on this together with the relevant authorities,” she said. Opal has capacity of 36 billion cubic metres, but it has been operating at half that for the last three years. Russia and the Commission also are at odds over an inquiry into alleged anti-competitive behaviour by Gazprom, including overcharging customers and blocking rivals. A Commission spokesman said the Ukraine crisis would have no impact on this inquiry. While Europe lacks immediate alternatives to replace Russian supplies, long-term efforts are in place to reduce Moscow’s dominance in the sector. In an event that was not directly related but of significance to Russia’s future role in European gas markets, Greece launched an international tender on Monday for a study on the feasibility of a proposed pipeline to access large, recently discovered East Mediterranean reserves from Israel and Cyprus. There are also hopes that North American shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) could come to Europe and help reduce Russia’s influence. Following a shale gas production boom, the United States is expected to begin exporting LNG from 2015, although analysts say that U.S. exporters would prefer selling to Asia, where prices are twice as high as in Europe.

505	"BRUSSELS (AP)  The European Commission is delaying some talks on a new Russian pipeline that would bypass Ukraine to move natural gas via the Black Sea to southeastern Europe.Spokeswoman Sabine Berger said today the commission, the 28-country bloc's executive arm, will continue talks at a technical level but suspend planned political negotiations in light ""of the broader developments"" in the European Union's relations with Russia.The European Union last week suspended talks on visa liberalization and an economic pact with Moscow to protest against Russia's incursion into Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.The South Stream pipeline, in which Russia's Gazprom holds a 50 percent stake, would provide an alternative supply route for Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria and Italy. It's expected to ship as much as 63 billion cubic meters of gas from 2018.

506	"WASHINGTON (AP)  Four Central European nations are urging the United States to boost natural gas exports to Europe as a hedge against the possibility that Russia could cut off its supply of gas to Ukraine.Ambassadors from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic made their appeal Friday in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. A similar letter was expected to be sent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.The letter from the four nations, known as the Visegrad Group, asks for Congress to support speedier approval of natural gas exports, noting that the ""presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in Central and Eastern Europe.""The ambassadors warn that the unrest in Ukraine has brought back Cold War memories and that energy security threatens the region's residents on a daily basis.""Gas-to-gas competition in our region is a vital aspect of national security and a key U.S. interest in the region,"" the ambassadors wrote in a letter.Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes between Ukraine and Russia have led to gas supply cuts. Russian state gas company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government, which now owes $1.89 billion for Russian natural gas, by warning that if Ukraine doesn't pay off its debt, there could be a repeat of 2009, when Russia cut off supplies to Europe because of a pricing dispute with Ukraine.Recent advancements have made it possible for gas that normally flows through Ukraine to the European Union to instead flow the other direction so that nations such as Poland and Hungary can supply gas to Ukraine if Russia were to cut off its supply. But with gas supplies limited, the region is still vulnerable unless the United States makes it easier to import American natural gas, the ambassadors argued.Boehner and Republicans have been urging the Obama administration to clear the way for more exports amid a natural gas boom in the United States. The Department of Energy has only approved six export licenses in recent years out of about two dozen pending.In a statement Saturday, Boehner called on Obama to ""heed this call from our allies"" and ""do everything possible to use American energy to reduce the dependency on Russia for our friends in Europe and around the globe.""""I hope President Obama will heed this call from our allies to use his 'pen and phone' to direct the secretary of energy to immediately approve pending natural gas export requests and do everything possible to use American energy to reduce the dependency on Russia for our friends in Europe and around the globe.""The White House has argued that Russia's dependence on gas revenue makes it unlikely that the country will cut off supplies to Europe despite the ongoing crisis in the Ukrainian region of Crimea, where the Russian military has intervened in what the United States regards as a violation of international law.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that because Europe has had a relatively mild winter, gas supplies are at or above normal levels. He said even if the United States did approve more export licenses, it would take until the end of 2015 for gas to be delivered. ""Proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect,"" Earnest said.

""script"",""oiopub"",""http://troymedia.com/wp-content/plugins/oiopub-direct/zones.js"");By Gary Slywchuk on March 10, 2014Comments Off on Canada’s LNG export industry could benefit from the “Ukrainian Crisis”The US could start moving more gas to Europe, opening the door for Canada to sell to AsiaEDMONTON, AB, Mar 10, 2014/ Troy Media/ – The “Ukrainian Crisis” could be a game changer for the Canadian and global energy industry.While the direct impact on Canada from the crisis is negligible, the fallout could be immense. The crisis has affected Ukraine’s nascent natural gas industry as well as the pipelines used to transport Russian gas, but more importantly it has shown the importance of a safe, secure, politically-neutral source of energy for Europe and questions the EU’s reliance on Russian gas.The latest “Ukrainian Crisis” began with protests over EU integration and was fuelled by the Yanukovych government’s corruption, kleptocracy, and determination to quash any dissension. The protests have been bloodier and have lasted longer than any since the Orange Revolution and reignited long-smouldering geographic and ethnic divides. Yanukovych and his inner cabal have fled the country with billions of dollars, which has left Ukraine on the verge of bankruptcy. Ukraine now flounders precariously as a pawn in a game of realpolitik between Russia and the West which no one other than the Kremlin was prepared for.International companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron, both of which are willing to accept the risks associated with a poor business environment, have maintained their shale gas exploration programs in Ukraine, while ExxonMobil plans on reopening negotiations to explore the Black Sea once a new government has been elected. But in terms of the global gas industry, these are minor plays and do not impact anyone outside of Ukraine.Ukraine’s importance in the world energy market is at a transit point for Russian gas. The Russian pipelines which run through Ukraine supply 14 per cent of Europe’s total gas imports, and Russia’s threat to reduce the gas to Ukraine would affect all of Europe. However, the affect will be less than in previous disputes due to Gazprom’s new Nord Stream pipeline, new storage facilities in Europe, and high levels of gas in storage.If this crisis had happened during a cold January, the contagion within Europe could have been a disaster for EU consumers and businesses. Russia knows this and is using petro-politics to influence decisions in Brussels and throughout the EU.With more than 25 per cent of gas consumed in Europe coming from Russia, and countries such as Germany importing the majority of its gas from Russia, Europe has little choice but to placate Russia, at least in the short term. This is a wake-up call for the EU: unless it is willing to have Russia as the hegemonic power in Europe, it must diversify its energy supplies to include new supplies from Australia, the U.S., and Canada. This will change the entire world gas industry.Prior to the “crisis”, the U.S. was planning to export large amounts of gas to Asia, but delays in the widening of the Panama Canal have meant that the large LNG super tankers, designed to ship LNG to Asia, will not be able to travel through the canal until at least 2016. This means that there is extra shipping capacity from North America to anywhere – including Europe – that can handle the large LNG super tankers. It makes political, economic and logistical sense to move gas from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Europe. The “Ukraine Crisis”, as bloody as it is, provides opportunities for the Canadian industry, which, until now, has lagged behind the U.S. in development due to a lack of export infrastructure.Lessening the supply of U.S. LNG exports to Asia gives Canadian exporters a competitive and comparative advantage over other suppliers. The price difference, or arbitrage, between North American and Asian prices is as high as $12, meaning the price could be adjusted, benefitting both buyers and sellers, while still being competitive. Tankers from Canada’s West Coast can reach Asian customers in 11 to 15 days, much shorter than vessels from the Middle East. Most important, however, Canadian supply is not subject to the same level of political and security uncertainty that affect Russian and Middle East suppliers and the “Ukrainian Crisis” has shown security does matter.The future of Ukraine energy is as uncertain as ever. The realpolitik moves by Russia have changed the game and sparked a conversation on the future of not only Ukraine but European energy integration in its entirety. This is a conversation that is good for Canada’s LNG export industry and shows the importance of a secure and safe supply of LNG. One that Canada can supply.Ryan Lijdsman is a Canadian-based international business consultant.

511	"Andrew Leung considers the implications of a more autonomous CrimeaComments:  Over the years, Vladimir Putin has been building a Russian empire of energy pipelines throughout Europe. In aggregate, Russia provides about a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union, of which over half is carried through pipelines across Ukraine.Building on this powerful energy network, Putin harbours a vision of a ""Eurasian Union"" to rival the EU. This vision seems to be part of his dream of restoring the lost glories of the former USSR.It is possible that the vision goes beyond Eurasia, to include countries with historical, political or cultural ties, such as Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Vietnam.Ukraine is a lynchpin for Russia's energy supplies to Europe, while Russia's Black Sea Fleet based in Crimea's Sevastopol is the core of Russia's Eurasian power projection. So the loss of Ukraine to the fold of the West would not only threaten Russia's national security but also unravel Putin's Eurasian dream.For the West, Ukraine's about-turn presents a hard-won opening for bringing the country, whose western part is fiercely anti-Russia, into the EU fold - a further step to diminish Russia's stranglehold over Eastern Europe.Russian armed forces are already deployed to Crimea. Will Putin use military force to reverse the status quo in Kiev or occupy pro-Russia eastern Ukraine? This seems unlikely.The people in western Ukraine have clearly spoken. It's no use reclaiming a ticking anti-Russia political time bomb. Moreover, excessive military aggression will backfire on Russia's weak economy, vulnerable to energy demands in Europe. From a cost-benefit perspective, Russian energy supply would seem to be a more effective leverage over Ukraine.The US is warning against Russian military intervention, threatening visa bans and asset freezes. But any response stops short of direct military confrontation, given that America's hands are tied with a war-weary electorate, budget constraints and rising pressures on the US pivot to Asia.Taking advantage of America's military handicap, the EU's dependence on Russian energy, and the anti-Kiev sentiments of Crimea's Russian majority, Putin has moved with lightning speed. The parliament of Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea has proposed holding a referendum on Sunday to determine the region's future. This is presumably to present a fait accompli before the West gets its act together.The Russian president is likely to stick it out in Crimea, waiting for the predictable outcome of the referendum. If the outcome is for joining the Russian Federation, he would approve it, thereby annexing Crimea formally.If the outcome is for Crimea to have much greater autonomy, he is likely to use it as a pretext for strengthening Russia's military presence there, ostensibly to protect Crimea's Russian majority from an anti-Russia Kiev leadership. Either way, Putin is likely to be able to achieve his aim of securing a permanent home for Russia's crucial Black Sea Fleet.Henry Kissinger, writing recently in The Washington Post, has proposed a ""Finland model"" to solve the Ukrainian crisis, comparing the Scandinavian country's fierce independence while maintaining cordiality with Russia.This consists of: first, letting the Ukrainian people choose their collective future; second, not letting Ukraine into Nato, to avoid provoking Russia; third, leaving Ukraine free to create any government compatible with the will of its people; and fourth, in exchange for Russia's recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty, Crimea's autonomy would be reinforced in elections.Kissinger's formula would help de-escalate the rising tensions. Whether it could ensure that Crimea remains intact under Ukrainian sovereignty remains to be seen. What is clear is that the recent events for Ukraine's future are but moves on a grand chessboard between the West and a resurgent Russia under Putin.Andrew K. P.

Several U.S. officials, including House Speaker John Boehner, are pushing for the U.S. to increase natural gas exports to blunt the influence of Gazprom.A long, winding road to marketGetting U.S. natural gas on the international market has been a major struggle for producers for years. The Department of Energy has to approve every export, and the White House downplayed the chances of any major move, saying they don't see exports having much impact.As a practical matter, that's probably true. Ukraine's non-payment is a bigger issue than anything, and U.S. producers aren't going to be any more willing to give them free gas than Gazprom is. Still, there's a silver lining to all of this.Gas export complexities aren't a brand new problem, but they're something that has rarely gotten any political attention. The Ukraine situation may be just the excuse needed to get some much-needed attention for this problem, and even if the administration is unwilling to change policies now, with upcoming elections there could be a shift toward more action on freeing the market.Who benefits?With a lot of excess production available, the domestic price of natural gas is not expected to see a major impact from the exports. Prices are higher overseas, however, and having access to those markets at all could be a windfall for major producers, who can more easily grab some of that market share in Europe and Asia.The biggest potential winner is Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), the largest gas-focused producer in the U.S. The company is trading at a modest price right now with plenty of room to run, though with a current ratio of only 0.66 and a lot of debt there is more risk there than most.Canadian-based Encana (NYSE:ECA) is a somewhat safer choice, though it is also higher priced. It is also growing somewhat slower than the industry average, so it's tough to consider it a bargain at these prices.The safest by far, in my opinion, is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), which has been putting a lot of money into expanding its natural gas business in recent years. The company has higher margins than the other two producers mentioned, and it has the lucrative oil business to fall back on if the natural gas boom doesn't materialize. It stands as a responsibly priced company that is growing natural gas production at just the right time.And then there's GazpromAfter looking at those figures, this is another excellent time to look at the numbers on Gazprom itself, which dropped with the rest of the Russian stock market on the Ukraine crisis, and is trading at a criminally low price.While the other companies are looking at P/Es in the teens, Gazprom's P/E is hovering around 2, and trading at roughly a quarter of its book value. The company has much higher margins than other natural gas-centric plays, and is a market leader.Rather, Gazprom is the market leader, by far the largest natural gas company in the world. The company sees ten times the revenue of Chesapeake, and despite the panic selling over Ukraine, the company is irreplaceable to Europe, and that's true no matter how quickly the U.S. majors can start getting more exports to market.Jason Ditz has no position in any stocks mentioned.

513	House panel pushes bill to fast track federal approval of terminalsTrump crashes the gasbag party at DavosExcuses, obfuscation: Hawaii’s false alarm shows incompetence of liberal government Schumer and Democrats loyal to illegals at expense of AmericansThe Obama administration on Monday downplayed the notion that American natural gas exports could immediately lessen Russian leverage over Ukraine and Europe, but the idea is very much alive and gaining momentum on Capitol Hill.The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to fast-track legislation expediting the federal approval process for liquefied natural gas export terminals, two dozen of which remain trapped in lengthy reviews inside the Energy Department. A hearing on the measure, introduced just last week, will be held later this month, committee sources said.Republicans long have prodded the White House to speed up the process and take advantage of America’s abundance of natural gas by selling to allies in Europe and elsewhere. The issue has come into the spotlight in recent weeks as Russia strengthens its grip on the strategic Crimean peninsula, which will vote Sunday on seceding from Ukraine.Russia provides more than half of Ukraine’s natural gas and about 30 percent of Europe’s supply, giving it key power over both its neighbor and nations such as Germany that the U.S. must have on board to enact meaningful economic sanctions against Moscow.But the White House brushed off the notion that U.S. gas exports could have any impact on the current crisis in Ukraine.“Any actions the United States can take with our own exports and how that would affect markets — that’s a complicated process and more of a long-term proposition,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. “But we certainly take the energy security of our friends in Europe very seriously.”Mr. Carney also disputed the notion that Russia would cut off gas to Ukraine or Europe, saying Moscow must retain them as customers.While it’s true that changing the global energy landscape would take years, the promise of American natural gas, even if its delivery is years off, would be reassuring, said Steven Bucci, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign and National Security Policy at the Heritage Foundation.“They wouldn’t have to be worried about Vladimir Putin turning the spigot the wrong way and cutting them off,” he said. “It would tell all these European countries we’re going to help you not be dependent on Russia, so they can’t hold this big stick over you anymore.”A coalition of nations in central and eastern Europe, eager to end reliance on Russian fuel, is urging the U.S. to send a signal to Moscow that its days of using fuel as leverage are numbered.“Our dependence on natural gas imports from a single supplier is still anywhere between 70 percent to 100 percent in the region … it is not hard to see that energy security remains to be a critical aspect of the region’s geostrategic stability and independence,” reads a joint letter that the ambassadors of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent last week to House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.“The presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in central and eastern Europe, and congressional action to expedite LNG exports to American’s allies would come at a critically important time for the region,” the ambassadors wrote.The House legislation — the Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act — would eliminate America’s “self-imposed restrictions” on exporting natural gas, now in abundance thanks to the perfection of the drilling technique known as fracking and the discoveries of vast fuel deposits in places such as the Marcellus Shale.Energy companies have expressed a keen interest in selling the fuel to Europe and elsewhere, but federal rules and regulations require that any gas export project must be found to be in the nation’s best interest. The key component of that equation is whether exports would lower domestic supply and, in turn, raise prices in the U.S.The administration thus far has approved six export terminals; 24 remain under consideration.The House bill states that “any application for authorization to export natural gas … shall be granted without modification or delay.”Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

By Oleg Vukmanovic and Henning Gloystein, Reuters

As Russia tightened its grip on Ukraine's Crimea region this month, U.S. and European Union officials were urging the Obama Administration to speed up approvals of more liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals.

Yet Russian exporter Gazprom's ability to swamp European natural gas markets with supply while depressing prices will make it difficult for as-yet unavailable U.S. supplies to displace Russian gas in Europe.

The EU is keen to diversify away from Russian gas imports, a stance hardened by Gazprom's decision to switch off supply to Ukraine during a pricing dispute in 2009 which curtailed supplies to EU member states, as well.

Yet U.S. LNG, exports of which are expected to ramp up beginning next year, are not a silver bullet in supply diversification for Europe.

State-controlled Gazprom sells most of its gas to Europe in long-term deals that are partly linked to the price of oil.

It has recently agreed major price reductions with most of its European customers, including Germany's E.ON and RWE, France's GDF Suez and Italy's ENI and Edison.

The move has helped defend its leading position in Europe, including from potential U.S. shipments, and industry sources say that Russia may agree to further discounts.

U.S. exports to Europe would barely break even at current spot market prices, as operating costs, fees and shipping rates would push the price of U.S. cargoes above European spot levels.

""Prices don't need to go down further to cap new 2020 supply,"" said Thierry Bros, senior gas analyst at Societe Generale, adding that such a fall would effectively rule out any significant role for American LNG in Europe.

Only a slight drop in Russian long-term prices or a rise in U.S. gas prices would see North American LNG cargoes to Europe pushed out of the market by Russian gas pipelines as well, Reuters research shows.

Asia is Better for LNG
European spot gas prices currently stand at around $10 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), half of what Asian buyers pay. Because U.S. prices are below $5 per mmBtu due to the shale gas production boom, U.S. LNG exports have become attractive.

Although U.S. spot gas prices are low, however, forward curves show prices rising in North America while Europe's contracts come down.

That means even just slight further rebates by Russia or a move towards more EU spot market indexation would effectively push U.S. LNG out of the market in Europe.

""Lower European prices could make U.S. LNG profitable for the Asian market alone,"" said Thierry Bros.

Political Gas
Although the United States has overtaken Russia as the world's biggest gas producer, there's an important difference in the politics of energy between Washington and Moscow.

Private companies and market mechanisms determine U.S. trade flows, which make it difficult for the United States to wield energy as a tool to punish Moscow. That points to LNG cargoes steering away from Europe towards higher-value Asian and Latin American markets given current price trends.

Not so in Russia, where state-controlled Gazprom granted heavy price discounts to reclaim lost market share.

That policy allowed Russian gas exports to Europe last year to rise to record levels, while LNG suppliers or pipeline competitors like Norway's Statoil saw their European market shares shrink.

Polish leader Donald Tusk has said Germany should reduce its gas dependence on Russia for the sake of EU foreign policy. Speaking to press on Monday (10 March) at a military base in Siemirowice, on Poland’s Baltic Sea coast, he said: “In future, we will not be able to successfully resist against aggressive or expansionist steps by Russia if so many European countries will be dependent on [Russian] gas and will go even further down the road of dependence.”Subscribe now for a 30 day free trial.EUobserver is an independent, not-for-profit news organization that publishes daily news reports, analysis, and investigations from Brussels and the EU member states.

According to the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Russia last year supplied 167 billion cubic metres (bcm) of Europe’s 270 bcm gas imports. Some EU countries - such as Bulgaria, Finland, and Lithuania - get all their gas from Russia, while Germany relies on Russia for about 40 percent of its supplies.It also buys large amounts of Russian oil and coal, but it is easier to switch oil and coal providers, unlike gas, which is delivered mainly by fixed pipelines. In a sign of Germany and Russia’s ever-closer energy relations, Merkel in 2011 turned on the taps at Nord Stream, a €7.4 billion pipeline to bring Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea.  The man who orchestrated the project, former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, now works for Gazprom and speaks out on Russia’s side.He told German daily Die Zeit on Monday that while Russia’s intervention in Crimea is illegal, Germany should not point fingers because it took part in Nato bombings of Serbia in 1999 without a UN mandate. He also blamed the EU for causing the crisis by giving Ukraine an either/or choice on free trade ties with the EU or Russia. “That was the EU’s first mistake, which led to the conflict between Kiev and Moscow,” he said. Meanwhile, the Ukraine crisis has already impacted EU-Russia energy ties. EU energy commissioner Gunther Oettinger told German daily Die Welt on Monday he has suspended talks with Russia on a legal conflict over the South Stream pipeline, a project to pump more gas from Russia to Europe under the Black Sea. ""I won't accelerate talks about pipelines such as South Stream for the time being, they will be delayed,"" he said.A spokeswoman for the EU foreign service noted the same day that EU institutions have begun “preparatory work” on potential visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials, which could trigger a Russian retaliation. Ukraine itself gets 90 percent of its gas imports from Russia. But the EU is working on new arrangements to pump up to 8 bcm a year of gas in a “reverse flow” from Germany, Poland, or Slovakia to Ukraine to cut Russian dependence to 60 percent.EU officials told EUobserver the reverse gas could start flowing in six months’ time.It would come from a mixture of sources in Europe’s integrated pipeline network. But in the long term, EU countries are increasingly looking to shale gas, from inside Europe and from the US, as an alternative to Russian imports.EU centre-right leaders, including Merkel, have given the strongest support so far to Ukraine's hopes to one day join the EU.The EU commission will officially agree to offer Ukraine €1.1 billion in emergency aid on Thursday, part of which will help to pay for Russian gas.If industry thought a US-style shale gas revolution would easily find its way across the Atlantic, it has had a rude awakening.France, Germany, Italy and other EU states should stop selling high-end military technology to Russia in light of the Ukraine crisis.EU leaders meeting in Brussels next week will look at ways to lower the bloc's dependence on Russian gas as they prepare economic sanctions against Moscow.The Ukrainian crisis has been a gamechanger in Poland's European election campaign.Killing the prospect of Turkey's EU membership would be a grave mistake. Achieving broader convergence on trade would be the ideal option.The EU should consider blacklisting more Russian oligarchs in line with a US sanctions review, a senior US diplomat said."	Business

  ""Meet Viktor Yanukovych, who is running for the presidency of Ukraine."" Vladimir Putin and I were standing in his office at the presidential dacha in late 2004 when Yanukovych suddenly appeared from a back room. Putin wanted me to get the point. He&apos;s my man, Ukraine is ours - and don&apos;t forget it.The ""Ukrainian problem"" has been brewing for some time between the West and Russia. Since Ukraine&apos;s Orange Revolution, the United States and Europe have tried to convince Russia that the vast territory should not be a pawn in a great-power conflict but rather an independent nation that could chart its own course. Putin has never seen it that way. For him, Kiev&apos;s movement toward the West is an affront to Russia in a zero-sum game for the loyalty of former territories of the empire. The invasion and possible annexation of Crimea on trumped-up concerns for its Russian-speaking population is his answer to us.The immediate concern must be to show Russia that further moves will not be tolerated and that Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity is sacrosanct. Diplomatic isolation, asset freezes and travel bans against oligarchs are appropriate. The announcement of air defense exercises with the Baltic states and the movement of a U.S. destroyer to the Black Sea bolster our allies, as does economic help for Ukraine&apos;s embattled leaders, who must put aside their internal divisions and govern their country.The longer-term task is to answer Putin&apos;s statement about Europe&apos;s post-Cold War future. He is saying that Ukraine will never be free to make its own choices - a message meant to reverberate in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states - and that Russia has special interests it will pursue at all costs. For Putin, the Cold War ended ""tragically."" He will turn the clock back as far as intimidation through military power, economic leverage and Western inaction will allow.After Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, the United States sent ships into the Black Sea, airlifted Georgian military forces from Iraq back to their home bases and sent humanitarian aid. Russia was denied its ultimate goal of overthrowing the democratically elected government, an admission made to me by the Russian foreign minister. The United States and Europe could agree on only a few actions to isolate Russia politically.But even those modest steps did not hold. Despite Russia&apos;s continued occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the diplomatic isolation waned and then the Obama administration&apos;s ""reset"" led to an abrupt revision of plans to deploy missile defense components in the Czech Republic and Poland. Talk of Ukraine and Georgia&apos;s future in NATO ceased. Moscow cheered.This time has to be different. Putin is playing for the long haul, cleverly exploiting every opening he sees. So must we, practicing strategic patience if he is to be stopped. Moscow is not immune from pressure. This is not 1968, and Russia is not the Soviet Union. The Russians need foreign investment; oligarchs like traveling to Paris and London, and there are plenty of ill-gotten gains stored in bank accounts abroad; the syndicate that runs Russia cannot tolerate lower oil prices; neither can the Kremlin&apos;s budget, which sustains subsidies toward constituencies that support Putin. Soon, North America&apos;s bounty of oil and gas will swamp Moscow&apos;s capacity. Authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline and championing natural gas exports would signal that we intend to do precisely that. And Europe should finally diversify its energy supply and develop pipelines that do not run through Russia.Many of Russia&apos;s most productive people, particularly its well-educated youth, are alienated from the Kremlin. They know that their country should not be only an extractive industries giant. They want political and economic freedoms and the ability to innovate and create in today&apos;s knowledge-based economy. We should reach out to Russian youth, especially students and young professionals, many of whom are studying in U.S. universities and working in Western firms. Democratic forces in Russia need to hear American support for their ambitions. They, not Putin, are Russia&apos;s future.Most important, the United States must restore its standing in the international community, which has been eroded by too many extended hands of friendship to our adversaries, sometimes at the expense of our friends. Continued inaction in Syria, which has strengthened Moscow&apos;s hand in the Middle East, and signs that we are desperate for a nuclear agreement with Iran cannot be separated from Putin&apos;s recent actions. Radically declining U.S. defense budgets signal that we no longer have the will or intention to sustain global order, as does talk of withdrawal from Afghanistan whether the security situation warrants it or not. We must not fail, as we did in Iraq, to leave behind a residual presence. Anything less than the American military&apos;s requirement for 10,000 troops will say that we are not serious about helping to stabilize that country.The notion that the United States could step back, lower its voice about democracy and human rights and let others lead assumed that the space we abandoned would be filled by democratic allies, friendly states and the amorphous ""norms of the international community."" Instead, we have seen the vacuum being filled by extremists such as al-Qaida reborn in Iraq and Syria; by dictators like Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Iran and Russia, murders his own people; by nationalist rhetoric and actions by Beijing that have prompted nationalist responses from our ally Japan; and by the likes of Vladimir Putin, who understands that hard power still matters.These global developments have not happened in response to a muscular U.S. foreign policy: Countries are not trying to ""balance"" American power. They have come due to signals that we are exhausted and disinterested. The events in Ukraine should be a wake-up call to those on both sides of the aisle who believe that the United States should eschew the responsibilities of leadership. If it is not heeded, dictators and extremists across the globe will be emboldened. And we will pay a price as our interests and our values are trampled in their wake. Condoleezza Rice was secretary of state from 2005 to 2009.       "	Business
520	"FOLLOW:The biggest victim of the Ukraine crisis – other than the Ukrainians themselves, of course – may be Rand Paul. Since bursting onto the national scene four years ago, he has labored steadily and shrewdly first to shed his kook label, to make himself acceptable to the Party’s establishment, and then to steadily tug its policy agenda in his direction. His high-profile attacks on the Obama administration’s foreign policy agenda have excited conservatives and made traditional hawks do a slow boil.But the return of a classic Cold War scenario has awkwardly exposed the dissonance between conservatives’ still-strong nationalist impulses and Paul’s isolationism. Paul has an op-ed in Breitbart’s “Big Peace” weakly making the case that Ronald Reagan was more dovish than you think, and pleading against his critics, “splintering the party is not the route to victory.” Concurrently, he has an op-ed in Time laying out his plan of action in Ukraine. The Time op-ed is where Paul truly lets loose his long-suppressed inner kook.Everything about Paul’s argument is weird. Part of the weirdness is conveyed by the prose, which is bereft of specific facts, repetitive, and reads as if it were run through a foreign-language translation program (“This does not and should not require military action. No one in the U.S. is calling for this … I have said, and some have taken exception, that too many U.S. leaders still think in Cold War terms and are quick to ‘tweak’ the international community. This is true.”)The most uncomfortable thing about it is watching Paul attempt to steer the Ukraine debate toward appropriately Paul-esque solutions. He begins by endorsing the basic Republican talking points, which revolve around (1) general calls for more tough leadership by Obama; and (2) exporting more natural gas to western Europe. (Steve Mufson explains why the latter would have at best a delayed, very marginal effect.) But Paul adds other ideas, too. Some of them reflect an apparent inability to follow the news, like his ringing call for a boycott of the next G-8 summit in Russia:The U.S. should suspend its participation in this summer’s G-8 summit and take the lead in boycotting the event in Sochi. Yeah, this already happened.Paul goes on to argue, “America is a world leader, but we should not be its policemen or ATM.” So he’s saying the United States should lead the world, but this leadership should not entail any new financial or military commitment?  Actually, he’s going farther than that. He’s arguing that American leadership should involve less financial and military commitment. Paul’s plan entails stiffing the Ukrainians:We should also suspend American loans and aid to Ukraine because currently these could have the counterproductive effect of rewarding Russia.Yes, you read that right – in the face of a massive threat from Russia, the United States should impose financial penalties on Ukraine.Likewise, Paul demands that Obama “lead” our allies in Western Europe, but proposes we stiff them, too:I would reinstitute the missile-defense shields President Obama abandoned in 2009 in Poland and the Czech Republic, only this time, I would make sure the Europeans pay for it. You may be wondering just where this plan to lead our allies by treating them like ungrateful punks is going to work. Let Paul explain:Russia, the Middle East or any other troubled part of the world should never make us forget that the U.S. is broke.FYI, we’re not broke, we were never broke, and we’re getting farther away from being broke every year.If you haven’t figured out where Paul is going with this, the next sentence lays it out:We weaken our security and defenses when we print money out of thin air or borrow from other countries to allegedly support our own.Yes, the solution to Ukraine’s trouble is for the United States to adopt the gold standard. Of course.The painful ideological gyrations on display here show that the much-hyped libertarian resurgence within the Republican Party was never as solid as it appeared. Paul was able to rally Republicans to his side because he could position his anti-drone, anti-surveillance policies as the strongest opposition to Barack Obama. Now Vladimir Putin has created a situation where the most obvious line of attack sits to Obama’s right. News analyses in the New York Times (“Ukraine offers a moment for hawks like Mr. Rubio to reassert themselves”) and the Wall Street Journal (“The Ukraine crisis has given GOP foreign policy hawks a fresh opportunity to reassert themselves”) both reaffirm the hawks-strike-back narrative.Left unsaid is that the rise of Republican anti-interventionism was a partisan phenomenon, not an intellectual one. During the 1990s, Republicans in Congress assailed the Clinton administration’s military interventions in the Balkans, and George W. Bush ran promising a more “humble” foreign policy. The same dynamic works on Democrats, whose civil libertarian impulses spike during Republican presidencies and recede when a friendly Democrat occupies the White House.Paul’s foreign policy ideas worked for him when he could exploit partisan fear of Barack Obama. Now his intra-party rivals are exploiting the more obvious line of attack on Obama as a wimp in mom jeans. So Paul is stuck trying to peddle isolationism, the gold standard and telling Europe to pound sand as solutions.It’s the second high-profile assault claimed by the Taliban in recent days.Burns Strider may or may not be guilty of sexual misconduct. But it sounds like he was guilty of political malfeasance.A new surveillance tool given to an agency not known for its restraint.The presidential jet requires a sophisticated chilling system.President Trump’s rival turned friend says, “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.”The president’s threat to withdraw U.S. aid appears designed to trap Abbas into negotiating a bad deal.“We’re in a situation where we don’t have to convince America. We have to convince lawmakers to do the right thing.”Trump: “My administration wants to work with members in both parties … to promote clean air.” He’s doing the opposite.The accused, Burns Strider, worked on Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign as a senior adviser and faith outreach director.The rise of Trump is the most obvious answer, but the profound shift in the tone and substance of gay-rights advocacy is having an impact, too.The morning after Trump’s Saturday Night Massacre would just be another Sunday for Republicans.A breaking-news situation allows viewers to behold his bias in real time.The president’s prepared remarks were inoffensive (if braggadocious). Then, he went off script.A new study suggests the Midwest would still be blue if Democrats hadn’t refused to prioritize labor’s needs under Obama, Clinton, and Carter.He mainly emphasized that he didn’t know Britain First was a far-right extremist group when he promoted their anti-Muslim videos.The president tried to get rid of the special counsel in June, but backed down when White House counsel Don McGahn threatened to quit.Alexander “Doc” Jones is reportedly under investigation for inappropriate behavior toward women.The White House presented the outline of a deal — amnesty for Dreamers, but big asks — that might just make everyone mad.The museum’s curator rejected the White House’s first request, but made a “special offer” in return.Ever since he was wrong-footed by conservative opposition to the Gang of Eight bill, Rubio has fought to look “strong” on immigration.Don’t worry.

521	Ukraine is a complicated question worldwide. It is a relatively large Eastern European economy – certainly the biggest, after Russia, among the former Soviet Republics. It is also a major natural gas conduit for sales of Russian natural gas from Russia to the European Union.As such, it’s important to Russia, not just as a transit point for natural gas to its biggest customers in Europe, but also as a large economy that exports a lot of its agricultural products, its workers and its steel to Russia. Having an economy such as this in the Russian-led customs union would lend legitimacy to an organization the Russians have been trying to transform into a European Union-type economic alliance.In this post I’m going to attempt to lay out some issues, as well as some possible outcomes and solutions.First, let’s get something straight. There have been rumblings that the U.S. government has somehow been funding the protesters in Ukraine, hoping to topple the corrupt, pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. This is a silly idea. Why would the United States work to create a power vacuum? Why would the United States want to facilitate the rise to power of Julia Timoshenko, who by many accounts is just as corrupt as Yanukovych AND has ties to organized crime? It doesn’t make sense.The protests were peaceful until the Ukrainian parliament (the Rada) passed a law criminalizing protests and demonstrations, ostensibly because Yanukovych saw how unpopular his decision to turn away from an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) was, and decided that it would be wise to shut the demonstrators up. Why would the U.S. want to complicate the situation by funding violence? The only nation with anything to gain from the violence would be Russia, because the violence would give Russians an excuse to intervene under the guise of protecting the large number of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine.But let’s not speculate about who funded the violence. The only reason I mention this is because I’ve been reading Internet sites (run by people commonly described as “conspiritards”) who are spreading rumors about U.S. involvement in the protests – a party line commonly advanced by Russia itself, whose leadership don’t want to draw attention to their own behavior that led to the protests in the first place.When Russia began putting massive economic pressure on Ukraine and promising loans and lower natural gas prices to the cash strapped country, while implementing trade barriers and pressuring Ukraine to pay its debts immediately to the Russian company Gazprom, this had to have been a major reason for Yanukovych’s sudden turn to Russia and rejection of the West – even though at least half the country wanted closer ties to the West – or at least a national referendum, rather than a unilateral decision forced by Russian pressure.Now, the Russians have entered the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea – an autonomous republic in Ukraine under the pretext of protecting their military assets (the Russian Black Sea fleet is based there) and protecting the ethnic Russians in the area. The government of Crimea, which has already voted to secede, has also set a mid-March date for a popular referendum on separating from Ukraine and joining Russia. At the same time, the Crimean constitution defers to the Ukrainian constitution on matters that affect the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and the Crimean parliament has no right of legislative initiative.So what does this all mean?From what I see here, this is a Ukrainian national issue. This is an issue between Russia and Ukraine. This is an issue in which the United States has no right to directly interfere.We have no right to involve ourselves in Ukraine’s constitutional matters. We should not interfere in any negotiations between Russia and Ukraine (although the Russians refuse to negotiate with the new interim government of Ukraine, claiming they are extreme right nationalists). And to those legislators in Congress demanding sanctions, I have to ask – against whom?Last week’s Executive Order blocking property of persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine names no one, and “technically,” even though pro-Russian troops have entered Crimea, Russia can claim “pro-Russian” doesn’t mean “officially” Russian. All this at a time when the nation is war-weary, is cutting defense spending and has no appetite for another military action – especially one that does not involve it directly.Military action is not and should not be an option right now. Economic and energy chess, however, is another story. Russia has threatened to cut off supplies of natural gas to Europe. Oil and natural gas exports comprise nearly 60 percent of Russia’s total export market.Can the U.S. export enough natural gas to Europe to make Russia’s natural gas threat irrelevant there?Probably not, because we don’t have the infrastructure quite yet.We do, however, have a large petroleum strategic reserve, which we can open to sales on the global market, which would hit Russia where it hurts most. Granted, this doesn’t help the EU’s natural gas problem, but the economic pressure on Russia may force Putin to reconsider the natural gas threat.It’s a thought. I’m not saying it’s the solution, but it’s certainly a more viable one than the impotent Congressional screeches for sanctions or the neocon demands for military mobilization.Ultimately, though, we need to allow the people of Ukraine to solve their own issues, observe the trends closely and act accordingly, if needed.Tweets from @unitedliberty/united-liberty-writers	Business
522	"The recent occupation of Crimea in Ukraine by Russian military forces has been viewed by most as an outright violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. US President Barack Obama and US Secretary of State John Kerry have each responded firmly to these events. Kerry issued a warning to Russian President Putinof the isolation his country would soon face “politically, economically, and diplomatically.” Obama has spoken with Putin directly in attempt to diplomatically influence a reversal of Russia’s intrusion. Unfortunately, Putin has not yet reversed course.Even if Russia withdraws from Crimea and things in the region do calm, diplomatic levers to influence Russian behavior in the region will continue to be explored. Indeed, given the relative inability to affect the current situation, a long run set of strategies ought to be fully engaged. A fundamental lesson of the Cold War is that détente is born of a credible threat. Therefore, if US foreign policy is to be successful in swaying Russian behavior – current and future – then such a lever must be presented. Otherwise, Putin is correct in his assertion that “all threats against Russia are counterproductive and harmful.” The United States has a very clear opportunity to present a credible threat to Russia’s long term dominance in Europe. Ironically, it involves the very commodity that Russia has used to its advantage in recent history: natural gas.Natural gas is the patrimony of the Russian economy and a major source of its political, economic, and diplomatic leverage over the Ukraine, the European Union, and its other former Soviet neighbors. Indeed, threats to Gazprom’s market share in Europe are taken very, very seriously. This has been demonstrated in recent years by a concerted effort by Gazprom to defend its market, as seen in physical infrastructure investments (i.e. – the North Stream pipeline), plans to develop other infrastructure (i.e. – the South Stream pipeline), and a willingness to alter pricing terms over the past several years in the face of competitive threats. Each of these commercial actions has been undertaken to secure direct access to central and western European markets by avoiding transit country risk (in Belarus and Ukraine) and to maintain long term contractual relationships with customers in Europe.Importantly, the US government cannot actually direct any LNG supply to Europe, as that is a commercial decision in the hands of LNG suppliers and consumers. However, the US government can exercise policy levers that could lower barriers to entry and more easily facilitate trade to Europe.More specifically, if the countries of the European Union (EU)were granted Free Trade Agreement (FTA) statusthen the pathway for investment in LNG export capacity with anability to deliver supplies within the EU would be less encumbered. In effect, a non-FTA license from DOE would no longer be required for investment to commence on various US LNG export facilities, particularly since there are multiple LNG import facilities in Europe already with an ability to expand import volumes. Thus, FTA status to EU nations would present a credible threat to Russia’s long term dominance of the European market.
While such a policy direction does not present a near term solution to the current situation, it does present Russia with a new set of circumstances it will have to deal with going forward. The credible threat of US entry into the European gas market can be viewed as a policy move in a dynamic game. Whether or not US-sourcedLNG actually ever flows to Europe is not the issue. Indeed, if Russia were to act to defend its market, as it has demonstrated it will likely take strides to do (see above), then it is likely that little to no US gas would actually end up in Europe. However, the reaction by the Russians prompted by the policy move in the US would facilitate surety of gas supply to Europe, likely at a lower price than would have otherwise been the case. In the end, this outcome benefits Europe. As far as Ukraine is concerned, ittoo would be provided with an alternative long term supply option – via backhaul from its western neighbors. Of course, any actual supply to Europe from the US would take a while to materialize as no capacity to execute this trade currently exists, but the idea here is to present a credible threat that alters long term behavior, strategic and commercial.In point of fact, it is not very likely that US LNG exports would have a measurable impact on European independence from Russian gas, particularly in the near term. To begin, the profit on US trade to Asia far exceeds the profit on US trade to Europe. So, either the price in Europe would have to rise substantially or sales from US LNG suppliers to Europe would have to be subsidized in order for large volumes of trade to Europe to happen. The European market currently exceeds 50 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), so we would have to see well over 1 or 2 bcfd of LNG flowing from the US to Europe for the impact to be noticeable. Importantly, the resource base in the US can facilitate larger volumes, but this is not the issue; rather, it is that the current barriers to market entry create delays and inject uncertainty around making such investments. FTA status removes this impediment. But, given the slow pace of the federal approval process for LNG export permits to non-FTA countries, US LNG suppliers will have little to no capability to send supplies to Europe for the foreseeable future, thus lending credence to the remarks ofEnergy and Commerce Chairman Fred Uptonearlier this week that ""the Department of Energy's approval process for LNG exports is unnecessarily putting our allies at the mercy of Vladimir Putin.”If the EU member states have FTA status, US exporters would have the ability to sell spot LNG cargoes in Europe without having to seek regulatory approval. Thus, such a commitment by the USgovernment signals a willingness to allow US suppliers to compete with Russia’s gas industry in Europe – a credible threat so dramatic that it could force a recalculation of all future Russian foreign policy moves vis-à-vis its western neighbors, even without ever sending any appreciable supplies of US-sourced LNG to Europe.Post by Kenneth B Medlock III, Senior Director, Center for Energy Studies, Rice University’s Baker Institute, and Keily Miller, Research Associate, Center for Energy Studies, Rice University’s Baker Institute"	Business

SRE D ETE LNG 
	Even as tensions in Ukraine ease with Russian President Vladimir Putin asserting that military intervention is not on the cards and force will be used only as a last resort, the confrontation between Moscow and the West – the most serious since the end of the Cold War – has captivated world energy markets.
	Russia’s bloodless seizure of border posts in Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula threatens to derail hydrocarbon deliveries bound for Europe. In particular, with about a third of the continent’s natural gas supply coming from Russia – most of it via pipelines passing through Ukraine – any escalation of the conflict there will severely disrupt natural gas availability to downstream customers in Europe, sending prices soaring.
	Following two prior supply cuts in 2006 and 2009 and a possible third anytime, Europe is on the lookout for other sources that can reduce its dependence on Russian gas. The most viable alternative seems to be the U.S., which, thanks to the shale revolution, is flush with the commodity.         
	With the success of ‘shale gas’ – the kind trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations – and the advent of sophisticated drilling techniques, natural gas is now available in abundance, while domestic prices have fallen by two thirds. This gives the U.S. leeway to export some of the excess and cheap gas through sea – in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG  -  Free Report)	 – to the European markets.
	Let's look at some companies that are likely to benefit a great deal from the growth and development of the LNG markets.
	Houston, Texas-based Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report)	 is the first name that comes to mind. The only Federal Energy Regulatory Commission/FERC -approved operator in this space with the 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has got the first mover advantage. Cheniere is expected to witness earnings growth of 14% in 2014 and 33% in 2015, when first commercial production from the Sabine Pass facility is expected.
	While Cheniere Energy is clearly ahead of the pack when it comes to natural gas export, there are certain other players that are in line to get federal approval for their terminals. These include Dominion Resources Inc’s (D  -  Free Report)	 Cove Point facility in Maryland, Sempra Energy’s (SRE  -  Free Report)	 Cameron terminal in Louisiana and Energy Transfer Equity L.P. (ETE  -  Free Report)	/BG Group Plc’s Lake Charles facility, also in Louisiana.
	As natural gas production in the U.S. soars, domestic prices remain constrained, and the Obama administration speeds up LNG approvals, more and more companies will be eyeing European markets through export. Importantly, this will loosen Russia’s energy squeeze on Europe and provide the region with long-term energy security.Sempra Energy (SRE) - free report >>Dominion Energy Inc.

528	"With Russia’s invasion of Crimea, the threat is greater than Vladimir Putin’s ambitions, the real danger to the world is that oil and natural gas are once again being used as a weapon of war.This isn’t the first time. When Russia cut off natural gas supplies in 2009 to Ukraine and six other countries in the middle of winter, millions were left in the cold until they paid Russia’s ransom in the form of higher prices. It was a stark example how vulnerable Europe had become to Russia’s control over energy resources. I said at the time it should be a wake-up call to an America confronting its own foreign oil dependence issue and the national security and economic threats that come with it.We rely on oil suppliers around the world for half of the oil we use. Our OPEC oil dependence is particularly troubling. We’re caught in OPEC’s web that has entangled us in wars and Middle East politics and costing thousands of American lives and trillions of tax dollars.I launched the Pickens Plan to help America get free from dangerous oil and make sure energy could never again be used as a weapon against us. I’ve urged America to use our vast domestic resources to create a real alternative to OPEC oil, and natural gas is the only resource to do that. But now it seems like everyone with a microphone is calling on the United States to begin exporting natural gas to Europe to undercut Russia’s power over the region.
I have nothing against exporting American natural gas – thanks to hydro-fracturing and horizontal drilling we’ve got more of it than anyone else in the world – but it’s foolish to think we can just turn on the tap and expect Russia to melt like the Wicked Witch. Realistically, it will be early 2016 at best before any of the permitted liquefied natural gas export facilities come on line. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and Russia’s expansion plans can’t be thwarted with our energy overnight.Russia is the world’s second-largest supplier of oil and has tremendous power over the market. While America’s oil and natural gas industry has achieved stunning increases in domestic production, this has done nothing to alleviate our vulnerability to foreign oil. Russia’s intrusion into Ukraine last week caused our prices to spike $3 in a single day. This dangerous dependence makes us just as vulnerable to state-sponsored energy-terrorism as Ukraine, which is why we can’t liberate Europe from its dependence until we’ve freed ourselves first.The fact is, the only way American can reclaim control of its foreign policy is to take advantage of our own resources. The best way to make a big difference quickly is to transition heavy-duty trucks from diesel to natural gas. That is beginning to happen. More and more trucking, delivery, and refuse and recycling companies are switching to natural gas – compressed or liquid. All up and down our Interstate highway system LNG and CNG fueling islands are sprouting up. It’s a great start, but we need to do more.We should step back, look at all our resources and build a real plan to make the highest and best use of them right here at home. Reducing our dependence on dangerous oil will do more than just make America safer and stronger, it will lower demand and hit Russia where it really hurts: In the value of its oil and gas exports. Long-term strategic thinking and energy planning can be used to cripple foreign governments. President Reagan proved that in 1982 when he worked with Saudi Arabia and encouraged them to overproduce oil, ultimately collapsing oil prices...and Russia. It’s unlikely we have that same card to play with the Saudi’s today, and it would bust our domestic industry anyway. But we do have other cards to play, and natural gas as a fuel substitute for OPEC oil is the trump card.Putin’s invasion of Crimea shouldn’t be fodder for the cable chat shows, it should be a rallying cry for American energy policy. It should remind us that we are blessed with enormous natural gift and we should have a plan to properly use those resources to be sure foreign oil can never again be used as a weapon of war."

529	"From London to Washington politicians and commentators have arrived at a solution to their Putin problem. Russia is weak, their argument claims, because it depends on oil and gas revenue. Unleash American energy on the world and watch the Kremlin crumble. It's a neat answer, because none of the Western powers wants a real war over Crimea, and UK, German, Italian and others' financial interests make them reluctant to back sanctions on Russia. 
John Boehner, speaker of the US House of Representatives, says swifter approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports ""is one clear step the US can take to stand by our allies and stand up to Russian aggression"". Lisa Murkowski, a senator from Alaska,

Let’s not forget that one day, many of us will be headed towards retirement.”The immediate concern must be to show Moscow that further moves will not be tolerated and that Ukraine’s territorial integrity is sacrosanct“Meet Viktor Yanukovych, who is running for the presidency of Ukraine.” Vladimir Putin and I were standing in his office at the presidential dacha in late 2004 when Yanukovych suddenly appeared from a back room. Putin wanted me to get the point. He’s my man, Ukraine is ours - and don’t forget it.The “Ukrainian problem” has been brewing for some time between the West and Russia. Since Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, the United States and Europe have tried to convince Russia that the vast territory should not be a pawn in a great-power conflict but rather an independent nation that could chart its own course. Putin has never seen it that way. For him, Kiev’s movement toward the West is an affront to Russia in a zero-sum game for the loyalty of former territories of the empire. The invasion and possible annexation of Crimea on trumped-up concerns for its Russian-speaking population is his answer to us.The immediate concern must be to show Russia that further moves will not be tolerated and that Ukraine’s territorial integrity is sacrosanct. Diplomatic isolation, asset freezes and travel bans against oligarchs are appropriate. The announcement of air defence exercises with the Baltic states and the movement of a US destroyer to the Black Sea bolster our allies, as does economic help for Ukraine’s embattled leaders, who must put aside their internal divisions and govern their country.The longer-term task is to answer Putin’s statement about Europe’s post-Cold War future. He is saying that Ukraine will never be free to make its own choices - a message meant to reverberate in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states - and that Russia has special interests it will pursue at all costs. For Putin, the Cold War ended “tragically.” He will turn the clock back as far as intimidation through military power, economic leverage and Western inaction will allow.After Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, the United States sent ships into the Black Sea, airlifted Georgian military forces from Iraq back to their home bases and sent humanitarian aid. Russia was denied its ultimate goal of overthrowing the democratically elected government, an admission made to me by the Russian foreign minister. The United States and Europe could agree on only a few actions to isolate Russia politically.

Despite Russia’s continued occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the diplomatic isolation waned and then the Obama administration’s “reset” led to an abrupt revision of plans to deploy missile defence components in the Czech Republic and Poland. Talk of Ukraine and Georgia’s future in Nato ceased. Moscow cheered.This time has to be different. Putin is playing for the long haul, cleverly exploiting every opening he sees. So must we, practicing strategic patience if he is to be stopped. Moscow is not immune from pressure. This is not 1968, and Russia is not the Soviet Union. The Russians need foreign investment; oligarchs like travelling to Paris and London, and there are plenty of ill-gotten gains stored in bank accounts abroad; the syndicate that runs Russia cannot tolerate lower oil prices; neither can the Kremlin’s budget, which sustains subsidies toward constituencies that support Putin. Soon, North America’s bounty of oil and gas will swamp Moscow’s capacity. Authorising the Keystone XL pipeline and championing natural gas exports would signal that we intend to do precisely that. And Europe should finally diversify its energy supply and develop pipelines that do not run through Russia.Many of Russia’s most productive people, particularly its well-educated youth, are alienated from the Kremlin. They know that their country should not be only an extractive industries giant. They want political and economic freedoms and the ability to innovate and create in today’s knowledge-based economy. We should reach out to Russian youth, especially students and young professionals, many of whom are studying in US universities and working in western firms. Democratic forces in Russia need to hear American support for their ambitions. They, not Putin, are Russia’s future.Most important, the United States must restore its standing in the international community, which has been eroded by too many extended hands of friendship to our adversaries, sometimes at the expense of our friends. Continued inaction in Syria, which has strengthened Moscow’s hand in the Middle East, and signs that we are desperate for a nuclear agreement with Iran cannot be separated from Putin’s recent actions. Radically declining US defence budgets signal that we no longer have the will or intention to sustain global order, as does talk of withdrawal from Afghanistan whether the security situation warrants it or not. We must not fail, as we did in Iraq, to leave behind a residual presence. Anything less than the American military’s requirement for 10,000 troops will say that we are not serious about helping to stabilise that country.The notion that the United States could step back, lower its voice about democracy and human rights and let others lead assumed that the space we abandoned would be filled by democratic allies, friendly states and the amorphous “norms of the international community.” Instead, we have seen the vacuum being filled by extremists such as AlQaida reborn in Iraq and Syria; by dictators like Bashar Al Assad, who, with the support of Iran and Russia, murders his own people; by nationalist rhetoric and actions by Beijing that have prompted nationalist responses from our ally Japan; and by the likes of Vladimir Putin, who understands that hard power still matters.These global developments have not happened in response to a muscular US foreign policy: Countries are not trying to “balance” American power. They have come due to signals that we are exhausted and disinterested. The events in Ukraine should be a wake-up call to those on both sides of the aisle who believe that the United States should eschew the responsibilities of leadership. If it is not heeded, dictators and extremists across the globe will be emboldened. And we will pay a price as our interests and our values are trampled in their wake.— Washington Post. Condoleezza Rice was secretary of state from 2005 to 2009.The “Ukrainian problem” has been brewing for some time between the West and Russia. Since Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, the United States and Europe have tried to convince Russia that the vast territory should not be a pawn in a great-power conflict but rather an independent nation that could chart its own course. Putin has never seen it that way. For him, Kiev’s movement toward the West is an affront to Russia in a zero-sum game for the loyalty of former territories of the empire. The invasion and possible annexation of Crimea on trumped-up concerns for its Russian-speaking population is his answer to us.The immediate concern must be to show Russia that further moves will not be tolerated and that Ukraine’s territorial integrity is sacrosanct. Diplomatic isolation, asset freezes and travel bans against oligarchs are appropriate.

Anything less than the American military’s requirement for 10,000 troops will say that we are not serious about helping to stabilise that country.The notion that the United States could step back, lower its voice about democracy and human rights and let others lead assumed that the space we abandoned would be filled by democratic allies, friendly states and the amorphous “norms of the international community.” Instead, we have seen the vacuum being filled by extremists such as AlQaida reborn in Iraq and Syria; by dictators like Bashar Al Assad, who, with the support of Iran and Russia, murders his own people; by nationalist rhetoric and actions by Beijing that have prompted nationalist responses from our ally Japan; and by the likes of Vladimir Putin, who understands that hard power still matters.These global developments have not happened in response to a muscular US foreign policy: Countries are not trying to “balance” American power. They have come due to signals that we are exhausted and disinterested. The events in Ukraine should be a wake-up call to those on both sides of the aisle who believe that the United States should eschew the responsibilities of leadership. If it is not heeded, dictators and extremists across the globe will be emboldened. And we will pay a price as our interests and our values are trampled in their wake.— Washington Post. Condoleezza Rice was secretary of state from 2005 to 2009.The notion that the United States could step back, lower its voice about democracy and human rights and let others lead assumed that the space we abandoned would be filled by democratic allies, friendly states and the amorphous “norms of the international community.” Instead, we have seen the vacuum being filled by extremists such as AlQaida reborn in Iraq and Syria; by dictators like Bashar Al Assad, who, with the support of Iran and Russia, murders his own people; by nationalist rhetoric and actions by Beijing that have prompted nationalist responses from our ally Japan; and by the likes of Vladimir Putin, who understands that hard power still matters.These global developments have not happened in response to a muscular US foreign policy: Countries are not trying to “balance” American power.

532	Just days after the head of the Russian state-owned company Gazprom threatened to cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine, officials say the energy company is likely to increase prices by about 37 percent.Prices could rise from $268.50 to $368.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of the fuel in the second quarter, Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Prodan said on Sunday, as reported by Interfax news agency.Since ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia in late February, Ukraine hasn't paid its gas bill that the company said is worth $2 billion.“Either Ukraine makes good on its debt and pays for current supplies, or there is risk of returning to the situation of early 2009,” Gazprom’s CEO Alexei Miller threatened on Friday. Gazprom in 2009 cut gas supplies to Ukraine over price disputes.In light of the recent threats, Ukraine has remained silent especially as Russian troops threaten military force on Ukraine’s autonomous region of Crimea.Yanukovych agreed in December to a $15 billion Russian aid package, which included a 30 percent discount on natural gas. Many Ukrainians saw this as an exchange for backing out of a deal that would integrate Ukraine more closely with the European Union. With Yanukovych out, the deal with Moscow was left in doubt.Interestingly enough, some energy security experts believe that Russia’s threats may be empty as it may lose money if it follows up on cutting supplies. It's also one reason why experts believe Russia will deescalate the conflict.If gas supplies are disrupted or if tensions escalate further, it could cost OAO Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) $20 billion and eliminate $6 billion worth of customs duties for Russia, possibly bankrupting the company, Mikhail Korchemkin, the executive director of East European Gas Analysis, told International Business Times. That means there will be less revenue for a company that makes up nearly 8 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product as well as a significant portion of the state's budget revenues, and that’s why Russia believes “Gazprom is more valuable than Crimea,” Korchemkin said.But if Russia did decided to shut off gas supplies, the European Union's executive arm said it would assist Ukraine by reversing existing flows back to Kiev.“In the short term, the [European] Commission is ready to assist Ukraine in diversifying its gas supply routes, notably by ensuring that reverse flows with the EU, notably via Slovakia [in addition to Poland and Hungary, as is currently the case], can be operationalized as soon as possible,” the commission said.--(Note: Natural gas in the Ukraine photo by Shutterstock.com.)Subscribe	Business

Helping to contain the crisis is the fact that Russia, Europe and to a lesser extent the United States are tied together in a powerful web of financial and economic ties that didn’t exist, say, during the real Cold War. Their influence runs counter to the many, many cries from hawks to impose tough economic sanctions on Russia, as if the giant Eurasian power were a small “rogue state.” The Washington Post, for instance, said in an editorial:

Some argue that the West lacks the means to damage the Putin regime or that the United States cannot act without Europe, but neither claim is true. Banking sanctions—denying Russians and their banks access to the U.S. financial system—could deal a powerful blow. Mr. Obama must respond to Mr. Putin with measures that force the Russian ruler to rethink his options.

But, as CNN reports:

Russia is the European Union’s third-biggest trading partner after the United States and China, with goods and services worth more than $500 billion exchanged in 2012. About 75% of all foreign direct investment in Russia originates in EU member states, according to the European Commission.
In addition, Russia is the single biggest supplier of energy to the European Union. British energy firm BP is the second-largest shareholder in Russia’s leading oil producer Rosneft, and some of the biggest energy companies in Germany, the Netherlands and France are invested in a joint venture with Russian gas giant Gazprom.

And, in a lengthy interview in The American Interest, Zbigniew Brzezinski points with regret to the fact that British bankers, who have large deposits of Russian cash—particularly from Russian oligarchs—are resisting any sort of confrontation over Ukraine:

The British seem inclined to argue, “Well, there’s a lot of Russian money in our banks.”… The bankers doubtless have a lot of influence, particularly in political systems in which money is increasingly the mechanism that oils the “democratic process.”

Earlier, the BBC had reported that a document carried by a top British official read: “The U.K. should not support for now trade sanctions or close London’s financial center to Russians.”
The New York Times, in a long March 7 piece analyzing US and European business interests in Russia and their effect on the politics of the situation, quoted several executives with Western firms who clearly want to cool the crisis talk:

European businesses “have no interests in any deterioration of the current international situation linked to Ukraine,” Frank Schauff, the chief executive of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, said on Friday. “We call upon all parties to engage in a constructive dialogue, which will secure stability, welfare and economic growth on the European Continent.”

Among American companies cited in the Times are Pepsi, Ford and John Deere. The Times quoted Ken Golden, director of global public relations for Deere, in its piece:

While Russia represents less than 5 percent of Deere’s total equipment sales, the company recently cited Russia as being key to its future growth. “We urge political leaders to solve this issue without violence and in accord with international agreements,” Mr. Golden said.

It even extends to the defense industry. According to Defense News, in a piece titled “Amid Ukraine Crisis, EU Plays It Safe,” various European arms manufacturers, including in Sweden, value current and potential sales to Russia. France is apparently insisting that it will continue to sell arms to Russia, including a $1.7 billion deal for two Mistral-class helicopter carriers. Said one expert quoted in the piece:

It looks like the Europeans are extremely keen to do everything except anything that hurts their commercial interests. There is zero appetite to hurt business interests, and arms sales fit into that category.

Still, while Vladimir Putin and his nationalist Russian base might believe that ancient monasteries, the Kievan Rus and heaven knows what else justify the illegitimate annexation of Crimea and Russia’s overweening influence in Ukraine, and that Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine need protecting, Moscow’s actions in Ukraine are nearly certain to contribute to a deeper political divide between the United States and Russia. Just as the unilateral US and NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1998–99, the illegal US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the US-NATO war against Libya in 2011 all bolstered Russian nationalism and strengthened the Russian military, Russia’s occupation and pending annexation of Crimea will do the same in reverse. Hawks, pro-NATO militants, supporters of building up US military forces and missile-defense systems in Eastern Europe, and critics of President Obama’s defense cuts, will all be aided greatly by Putin’s actions.
We’ll review the bidding on that tomorrow.

Hawks, pro-NATO militants, supporters of building up US military forces and missile-defense systems in Eastern Europe, and critics of President Obama’s defense cuts, will all be aided greatly by Putin’s actions.

According to Defense News, in a piece titled “Amid Ukraine Crisis, EU Plays It Safe,” various European arms manufacturers, including in Sweden, value current and potential sales to Russia. France is apparently insisting that it will continue to sell arms to Russia, including a $1.7 billion deal for two Mistral-class helicopter carriers. Said one expert quoted in the piece:

It looks like the Europeans are extremely keen to do everything except anything that hurts their commercial interests. There is zero appetite to hurt business interests, and arms sales fit into that category.

Plain, old-fashioned capitalism will prevent a new cold war between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and Russia’s gobbling up of the Crimean region. Capitalism, plus the fact that probably not one American in a thousand could locate Crimea on a map, and even the most hard-headed US political analysts have trouble coming up with a decent definition of what US interests in Ukraine might be.

Helping to contain the crisis is the fact that Russia, Europe and to a lesser extent the United States are tied together in a powerful web of financial and economic ties that didn’t exist, say, during the real Cold War. Their influence runs counter to the many, many cries from hawks to impose tough economic sanctions on Russia, as if the giant Eurasian power were a small “rogue state.” The Washington Post, for instance, said in an editorial:

Some argue that the West lacks the means to damage the Putin regime or that the United States cannot act without Europe, but neither claim is true. Banking sanctions—denying Russians and their banks access to the U.S. financial system—could deal a powerful blow. Mr. Obama must respond to Mr. Putin with measures that force the Russian ruler to rethink his options.

But, as CNN reports:

Russia is the European Union’s third-biggest trading partner after the United States and China, with goods and services worth more than $500 billion exchanged in 2012. About 75% of all foreign direct investment in Russia originates in EU member states, according to the European Commission.
In addition, Russia is the single biggest supplier of energy to the European Union. British energy firm BP is the second-largest shareholder in Russia’s leading oil producer Rosneft, and some of the biggest energy companies in Germany, the Netherlands and France are invested in a joint venture with Russian gas giant Gazprom.

And, in a lengthy interview in The American Interest, Zbigniew Brzezinski points with regret to the fact that British bankers, who have large deposits of Russian cash—particularly from Russian oligarchs—are resisting any sort of confrontation over Ukraine:

The British seem inclined to argue, “Well, there’s a lot of Russian money in our banks.”… The bankers doubtless have a lot of influence, particularly in political systems in which money is increasingly the mechanism that oils the “democratic process.”

Earlier, the BBC had reported that a document carried by a top British official read: “The U.K. should not support for now trade sanctions or close London’s financial center to Russians.”
The New York Times, in a long March 7 piece analyzing US and European business interests in Russia and their effect on the politics of the situation, quoted several executives with Western firms who clearly want to cool the crisis talk:

European businesses “have no interests in any deterioration of the current international situation linked to Ukraine,” Frank Schauff, the chief executive of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, said on Friday. “We call upon all parties to engage in a constructive dialogue, which will secure stability, welfare and economic growth on the European Continent.”

Among American companies cited in the Times are Pepsi, Ford and John Deere. The Times quoted Ken Golden, director of global public relations for Deere, in its piece:

While Russia represents less than 5 percent of Deere’s total equipment sales, the company recently cited Russia as being key to its future growth. “We urge political leaders to solve this issue without violence and in accord with international agreements,” Mr. Golden said.

Just as the unilateral US and NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1998–99, the illegal US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the US-NATO war against Libya in 2011 all bolstered Russian nationalism and strengthened the Russian military, Russia’s occupation and pending annexation of Crimea will do the same in reverse. Hawks, pro-NATO militants, supporters of building up US military forces and missile-defense systems in Eastern Europe, and critics of President Obama’s defense cuts, will all be aided greatly by Putin’s actions.

Also check out this recent article:Gazprom (NASDAQOTH:OGZPY) stated on March 7 that Ukraine has failed to pay for its natural gas deliveries in February. The failure to pay, the Russian gas giant notes, may result in a disruption in service. Gazprom went to lengths to reassure the world that it would continue to ship gas to Europe regardless of the Ukrainian conflict. ""There are no issues with transit shipments. Transit is paid and continues,"" a Gazprom spokesman said, referring to deliveries to Europe.Ukraine, on the other hand, is a different story. ""Today, March 7, was the deadline for payments for gas supplies to Ukraine in February. Gazprom has not received payments for the debt,"" Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said."" We cannot supply gas for free. Either Ukraine redeems debt and pays for the current deliveries, or there is a risk to return to the situation of early 2009.""The March 7 deadline for payments of $440 million came and went, and Moscow will have to decide what next steps to take.  Ukraine now owes a total of $1.89 billion to Gazprom. Even if Gazprom decides to stop delivery of natural gas to Ukraine, it is far from clear that it can be done cleanly without disrupting service to the rest of Europe. Much of Russian gas sold to Europe must traverse Ukraine through a web of pipelines. Ukraine could theoretically tamper with, or divert, natural gas intended for Europe.Moreover, cutting off gas to Ukraine, even if service to Europe is not disrupted, would escalate a conflict that has already reached crisis proportions. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a few days ago that Gazprom would end price discounts to Ukraine after they expire on April 1. Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych agreed to accept a 33% price discount last December.Written by James Burgess at Oilprice.com. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Putin (right) and Merkel look at each other during a joint news conference in Moscow's Kremlin, in this November 16, 2012 file photo. Heavily dependent on Russian gas and closer to Moscow than any other leading western nation, Germany faces a major policy dilemma as the Ukraine crisis descends into a Cold War-style confrontation. — Reuters picWARSAW, March 10 — Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas poses a threat to European sovereignty, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned today amid rising East-West tensions over Ukraine.
	“Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty. I have no doubt,” Tusk told reporters, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
	The top European economy buys around one third of its oil and gas from Russia and has extensive trade and investment links with the vast country to the east.
	Germany has tried to defuse the Western standoff with Moscow over Ukraine, but analysts say its voice is muted by fears of endangering its economic ties with Russia.
	“The Ukraine issue is a matter of the future security of the European Union,” Tusk said on a visit to a military base in northern Poland to mark 15 years since his ex-communist nation joined the NATO defence alliance.
	The 28-member EU needs to review its energy policy, he added, ahead of Merkel's Wednesday visit.
	“I'll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole,” he said.
	“I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money,” Tusk said.
	“This, of course, applies not just to Germany, but in recent years Germany has been a strong example of this phenomenon,” he added.
	Tusk said talks with Merkel would also focus on “how Germany could revise certain economic decisions, to avoid the paralysis of Europe at a time when it must act quickly and adopt a clear stance”.
	Washington on Friday played down the risk posed to the European economy by Russia's threat to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, insisting the region had adequate stocks.
	Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.
	Washington, which backs Ukraine's interim government and opposes Moscow's moves to seize the Crimean peninsula, said any gas embargo would hurt Moscow as much as Kiev. — AFPReuters Video: ‘Three Billboards’ takes top SAG awardBloomberg Video: US trade panel rejects Boeing claim in Bombardier caseA look at the third generation Porsche CayenneSee Anna Faris in ‘Overboard’Bloomberg Video: How to make a surfboardBloomberg Video: Apple guru Munster doesn’t see iPhone conspiracyCopyright ©  2018 Malay Mail OnlineAbout Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services"	Business

 WASHINGTON (AP) — Four Central European nations are urging the United States to boost natural gas exports to Europe as a hedge against the risk that Russia could cut its supply of gas to Ukraine, but the White House says such a move would take more than a year.Ambassadors from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic made their appeal Friday in a letter to John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. A similar letter was expected to be sent to Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate.The letter from the four nations, known as the Visegrad Group, asks for Congress to support speedier approval of natural gas exports. It notes that the ""presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in Central and Eastern Europe.""The ambassadors say the unrest in Ukraine has revived Cold War memories, and energy security threatens the region's residents daily.""Gas-to-gas competition in our region is a vital aspect of national security and a keyU.S. interest in the region,"" the ambassadors wrote in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes betweenUkraine and Russia have led to supply cuts. Russian state company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government — which already owes $1.89 billion (1.36 billion euros) for past deliveries — by warning that if Ukraine doesn't pay its debts, Russia could retaliate by cutting off wider supplies to Europe, as happened in 2009.Recent advancements have made it possible for Russian gas that normally flows to European Union customers through Ukraine to flow in the other direction, so Poland and Hungary could supply gas to Ukraine if Russian supplies halted. But with gassupplies limited, the region remains vulnerable unless the U.S. makes it easier to import American natural gas, the ambassadors argued.

 Both the United States and Europe are united in seeing the need for international monitors in the Crimea and maintaining a dialogue with Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine, but Europe’s close economic ties with Russia and dependence on Russian gas will make European leaders more reluctant to impose sanctions.Angela Stent, professor at Georgetown University and author of The Limits of Partnership: U.S.-Russian Relations in the Twenty-First Century, told IHS CERAWeek attendees that it’s unlikely Crimea will be a part of a territorially intact Ukraine if residents in Crimea vote for independence in the March 16 referendum. Stent and other international policy experts discussed geopolitical trends and the role of oil and gas in those trends – and the implications that geopolitics might have on oil and gas -- as the conference wrapped up on March 7.“The recent Ukrainian crisis feels like a cold war if you listen to the rhetoric of both sides, but it’s not the cold war,” said Stent. “We’re not ideological antagonists trying to carve up world between socialism and capitalism, our nuclear weapons are not pointedly targeted at each other anymore – and they could be.”In the Cold War era, Communist Russia wasn’t integrated into the global economy, so a Russian invasion of a country didn’t have much economic impact. But Russia’s recent move into the Ukraine is impacting Russia by depressing its stock market and value of the ruble. “This global integration works both ways,” said Stent. “While it can work against Russia, it also constrains European countries from the extent they can impose sanctions.”Differences have always existed within Ukraine, whose current borders were established following World War II. People from Western Ukraine, formerly part of Poland, speak Ukrainian and identify with Eastern Europe and don’t like the Russians, while those who live in eastern Ukraine speak Russian and identify with the former Soviet Union.In 1991, Ukraine voted to separate from Russia to become a sovereign country, and it was assumed that Ukraine would continue to exist as a nation with internal differences. However, existing weakness in Ukraine’s existing government structures in the past two decades, the government’s inability to create a functioning state and to create a national identity on which everyone agreed, gave Russian President Vladimir Putin an opportunity to invade Crimea, said Stent. Disgust over Ukraine’s previous government also has had some groups seeing an alignment with Russia as a better solution.Putin, who told former U.S. President George W. Bush in 2008 that he didn’t see Ukraine as a country, has invaded Crimea to prevent a territorially intact Ukraine from moving closer to the European Union’s orbit.

544	"The European foreign policy service has begun preparing proposals for sanctions against Russia, which the EU threatens to introduce in case of the absence of effective dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, says Maya Kosyanchich, the press secretary of the head of EU diplomacy Catherine Ashton.""I can not confirm the time frame, but I can confirm that the preparatory work has begun,"" says Kosyanchich, quoted by RIA Novosti.On Thursday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy stated about the results of an extraordinary EU summit that the EU could impose visa sanctions and freezing of assets on Russia, if in the next few days a dialogue between Russia and Ukraine do not begin. According to him, the relevant services of the EU will prepare proposals on sanctions in the near future. Council's statement does not say what group of Russian citizens could fall under EU sanctions.Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier that the damage caused by possible sanctions in respect of the situation in Ukraine will be mutual, because in today's world everything is interconnected, and everyone depends on each other. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said that Russia expects understanding of the counter-productivity of possible imposition of unilateral sanctions against Moscow by Western countries.

There’s a lot of talk about exploiting the US energy boom to undermine Putin and Russia.  This boom may have profound effects in the long run, but there is nothing that can be done now that can materially harm Putin in to punish him for his anschluss in Crimea, or subsequent aggressive moves he may make.Yes, the US restrictions on exports of natural gas and crude oil are economically idiotic, even absent geopolitical considerations.  But even if those bans were eliminated tomorrow (a huge if, given he who sits in the White House-or golfs in Key Largo, as the case may be) Europe’s energy situation would not change one whit.It would be possible to start moving large quantities of crude if the export ban were lifted, but this would be largely offset by a decline in US exports of refined products.  A major effect of the ban is to distort where crude is refined, not the total supply of crude and refined products (especially in the short run).  The major effect of the ban at present is to benefit US refiners who refine crude that is selling at below world prices because of the ban and export the products.  One study estimates that eliminating the ban would drop world oil prices by cents not dollars.With respect to natural gas the situation is even less favorable.  Even if DOE granted all pending LNG export licenses, it will be years before product will start flowing.  Cheniere received the first license, in May, 2011, and its facility will not come on line until late-2015 at the earliest.  The company had a head start because it was converting an existing facility built to import LNG: other facilities will take longer to build because they are starting from scratch.The long run impact of eliminating the export ban depends on the elasticity of supply of gas in the US.  If it is very elastic at current price levels, then yes, once the ban is lifted world prices will fall substantially, and Russia will be hit hard by that.  If supply is less elastic, the impact will be far smaller.  The elasticity of supply will depend crucially on technological factors, including the suitability of new formations to fracking and horizontal drilling, the depletion rates of wells, and the rate of technological innovation.  All of these factors are quite uncertain, and if the experience of the past decade says anything, it says be leery about making predictions about natural gas supply.In brief: US energy export policy is stupid, but fixing the stupidity will have no appreciable impact on Russia for years.Similarly, fixing stupid European policies on energy (e.g., fracking bans, massive renewables subsidies like Energiewende) should be done for reasons independent of geopolitics, and even if done tomorrow will have no material impact on European energy prices or Russian energy revenues for years to come.The main way to impose substantial costs on Russia today via energy would be to impose trade sanctions.  Given the fact that the oil market is essentially global in scope, and that coordinating a global boycott of Russian oil would be virtually impossible, natural gas is a more feasible target.  Europe could boycott Russian gas  unilaterally, and there is no effective way for Russia to sell that gas to Asia or anywhere else.There is a substantial asymmetry here.  Russia depends heavily on gas exports.  Approximately 25 percent of the Russian government’s revenue comes from Gazprom. The knock on effect on the Russian economy would likely be huge, as severe fiscal constraints would likely put substantial strains on the Russian banking system.Yes, Europe would be hurt by higher prices and lower consumption of gas.  But gas comprises a far lower percentage of European expenditures than it does of Russian income, meaning that the hit on Europe would be far smaller.  Moreover, some of the impact could be mitigated by substantially increasing coal imports, increased Norwegian production, and some diversion of LNG from Asia to Europe, especially to the UK (which has excess LNG import capacity and could use LNG to displace North Sea gas which it could then pipe to Europe).   Moreover, winter is ending, and the cost of a supply interruption in the spring and summer would be far less than the cost in the winter.But I doubt that is going to happen, because of another asymmetry.  The asymmetry in political will.  Old Europe has no stomach for a confrontation with Putin over Crimea, Ukraine, or much of anything else. (And yes, Donald Rumsfeld was an a$$hole-a claim I can vouch for based on family experience-but the Old Europe vs. New Europe formulation does capture an essential truth, especially where Russia is involved.) This lack of intestinal fortitude means that Old Europe-and especially Germany-is unwilling to pay any price to punish Putin.  Talk is free, and that’s all they are willing to pay.And don’t think for a moment that Putin hasn’t based his plans on exactly that calculation.In an attempt to scare off any attempt at sanctions, Russia has threatened retaliation: Lavrov has told Kerry any such moves will “boomerang.”  Other Russian officials have said that Russia can insulate itself from the west, thereby making it immune to any sanctions.The retaliation that has been threatened includes expropriation of the assets of western companies.  A quite predictable Russian reaction, and typically self-destructive.  Any such expropriation would just cement Russia’s reputation as a lawless country where foreign investors rush in where angels fear to tread.  Russian equity valuations would crater, and direct investment would too.  Capital flight would accelerate.  The costs inflicted on Russia would dwarf those inflicted on the US and Europe, and would last for years.Other that that, a great plan!  Another major asymmetry: any Russian retaliation would harm Russia far more than Europe or the US.  Some boomerang.It reminds me of the old joke about the genie who grants the muzhik one wish, with one condition: anything the muzhik wishes for he gets, but his neighbor gets double. The muzhik thinks for a minute, then says: “I wish that you pluck out one of my eyes.”All that said, I do not think that economic sanctions in the form of boycotting Russian energy or other exports, or cutting off imports (e.g., of drilling equipment) are the most effective, or the least costly, way of imposing costs on Putin and the elite on whom he depends. As I have said since Georgia, 2008, the best way to attack Putin and the elite is to go after their money in the west. (This policy is getting widespread publicity now.  I will lay claim to being a very early advocate.)Such a measure is targeted on those who make the decisions, rather than Russia and Russians generally: as such, it could not be used by Putin to claim that the west was waging a war on Russia.  Indeed, it could undermine his political support not just among the elite who would be paying the price for his adventures, but among the broader population who are already disgusted by corruption and who would be unlikely to have any sympathy for that corruption being exposed, and the ill-gotten gains being seized.  The cost on western economies would very small indeed.  It would represent a victory for the rule of law.But this would impose some costs on some very connected people in the west.  Moreover, precisely because it would strike so deeply at Putin it would cause him to lose his sh*t, and fear of that causes the Euros to shrink away from it in terror.But this is something the US can pursue unilaterally.  Yes, given that most dirty Russian money is in Europe or the Caribbean, these measures would be much more effective if the Europeans participated. But the US still can wield considerable power (note how it forced Switzerland to heel on tax issues-not something that I agree with, btw, just pointing out that the US has leverage) and indeed, the mere threat of exposing what it uncovers could make the Europeans think twice.But again, there is a lack of will.  Hope drives policy: “If we concede Crimea to Putin, he will stop.”In sum, there is a powerful policy tool at our disposal.  A far better tool than is available in most such circumstances.  Other tools (sanctions) are more costly.  Yet other supposed tools-increasing US energy exports-are chimerical.If we’re serious, we’ll use it.  But I have my doubts that we’re serious. If Europe (and to a lesser degree the US) has demonstrated anything in recent years, it is that they are past masters at kicking the can.  Crimea, Ukraine, and Putin are likely to be just another can.Affiliation: University of HoustonDr Pirrong is Professor of Finance, and Energy Markets Director for the Global Energy Management Institute at the Bauer College of Business of the University of Houston.

551	"If presidential straw poll winner and CPAC rock star Rand Paul were actually president, the senator told Fox News Sunday, his response to the current crisis in Ukraine would be to order up some drilling -- and lots of it.“I would do something differently from the president,” Paul said. “I would immediately get every obstacle out of the way for our export of oil and gas, and I would begin drilling in every possible conceivable place within our territories in order to have production we can supply Europe with if it’s interrupted from Ukraine.”Paul joins the growing contingent of Republicans using the crisis as an excuse to push an agenda of increased oil and gas production, including House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who declared last Wednesday that the best way to “support the Ukrainian people and confront Russian aggression"" is to speed up the approval of natural gas exports from U.S. fracking operations.The New York Times editorial board conceded in an Op-Ed that ""increasing natural gas exports could serve American foreign-policy interests in Europe, which gets about 30 percent of its gas from Russia."" However, the Times was quick to caution, ""even if the government approved more exports, setting up more facilities to liquefy and ship gas would take years and cost billions of dollars,"" while Putin ""would not stand idly by.""Paul, for his part, pushed even harder for fossil fuels in an Op-Ed for Time, in which he again emphasized what he sees as the role of oil and gas in addressing the crisis:I would immediately remove every obstacle or current ban blocking the export of American oil and gas to Europe, and I would lift restrictions on new oil and gas development in order to ensure a steady energy supply at home and so we can supply Europe with oil if it is interrupted from Ukraine.Because of so many of our current needless laws and regulations, President Obama has left Europe completely vulnerable because of its dependence on Russian oil and gas.I would support immediate construction of the Keystone Pipeline.Copyright © 2018 Salon Media Group, Inc.

                                        Since protests started in Ukraine last December, 661 people have been reported missing—and 272 are still unaccounted for as of last week. This even after opposition members have been given the go-ahead to look for them in prisons, morgues, and hospitals. The figure comes courtesy of Euromaidan SOS, whose coordinator predicts that most of those still missing will resurface. But the New York Times reports that the fear that some, or perhaps many, of the missing could have vanished at the hands of the brutal Berkut riot police, or pro-Russian or pro-Yanukovich forces, still persists, and it cites two cases as contributing to that fear.
                                    
                                        One opposition activist was abducted from a Kiev hospital and later found dead in a forest; a man abducted with him says their kidnappers spoke Russian and seemed like police officers. Another opposition organizer was abducted in late January, and though he turned up alive, he said he had been tortured by people he thought were members of Russia's special services. The Euromaidan SOS coordinator insists that rumors of authorities burning bodies of dozens they killed are likely false, yet he notes that bloodstains were found at some police stations where protesters were held. DNA tests are needed, he says, but ""this is a huge amount of work, and there is some chance that the police will not do it.""

553	CPAC Straw Poll winner Rand Paul proved his serious leadership mojo Sunday, telling Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace that if he were president, he knows exactly what he’d do in response to Russia’s invasion of Crimea:“I would do something differently from the president,” Paul said. “I would immediately get every obstacle out of the way for our export of oil and gas, and I would begin drilling in every possible conceivable place within our territories in order to have production we can supply Europe with if it’s interrupted from Ukraine.”Apparently no one told Mr. Paul that drilling oil and gas wells is a wee bit more complex than turning on a tap — we are not geological engineers, but we are fairly certain that it takes a little while, like at least longer than getting your car’s heater to really warm you up on a cold day, we bet. ThinkProgress notes that Paul is just the latest in a number of legislators calling for a drill-for-victory approach; Paul Ryan and Ted Poe both want the Department of Energy to fast-track permits to sell as much gas and oil as we can to Ukraine and Europe, which would tell the Russians that they’d better not mess with the power of the free market.The only downside to such plans, really, is that they ignore the free actual market for natural gas:As Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations points out, decisions on where to ship gas are made primarily by the market, not by governments, and it’s much more profitable for the U.S. to ship gas to Asia.Stupid old market — can’t we just tell it what to do, for freedom? Also, too, there’s Friday’s New York Times editorial that says it’s unlikely that Russia would just sit back and let European sales go to American exports, since all it would take to woo them back would be a price cut on Russian gas. Once again, those stupid market forces could completely get in the way of our plans to boss the economy around.Oh, yeah, and then there is that infrastructure thing we mentioned earlier; the Times points out thateven if the government approved more exports, setting up more facilities to liquefy and ship gas would take years and cost billions of dollars.That almost seems to suggest that maybe energy policy is more of a long-term proposition than something that can just be deployed instantly like the Delta Force. Still, promising to drill a lot of holes in the ground is definitely more manly than Barack Obama walking around in mom jeans, and can probably even be done with one’s shirt off, depending on the weather.But you have to admire Sen. Paul’s can-do spirit, which would literally drill every conceivable possible place to get oil and gas to Europe right away within a couple years of this crisis, after which there had better not be any more international crises involving fossil fuels, because then we’d have to start drilling in the inconceivable places.[NYT via ThinkProgress]Follow Doktor Zoom on Twitter.

In The Arena
            By GAL LUFTMarch 09, 2014Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given a boost to those calling for the United States to expedite natural gas exports to help allies overseas. In this thinking, American gas exports — in the form of liquefied natural gas, or LNG — are not only a boon to the domestic economy but also a potent geopolitical tool to be wielded against the Kremlin.  Never mind that the United States won’t have its first LNG export terminal in operation until late 2015 at the very earliest; that all of its approved gas exports are already committed to long-term contracts; and that Ukraine does not even have a single terminal for receiving LNG. Story Continued Below Even without the newly concocted geopolitical rationale for exports, though, Washington seems favorably disposed to permitting much of America’s surplus gas to migrate overseas. Since the beginning of the shale gas revolution, which kicked off in 2005 , the U.S. Department of Energy has approved six LNG export terminals with a combined export capacity of 8.5 billion cubic feet a day, and more projects are in the works.  But before we put more of our gas in the service of our foreign policy, be it saving Europe from Russia’s claws or Asia from its toxic air, we should ask ourselves one question: Why aren’t we using more gas in our cars and trucks?  Most of America’s newly cheap gas finds its way to the electricity sector, where it displaces coal as a fuel source. Coal’s share of total electricity generation declined from 51 percent 10 years ago to 40 percent today; that percentage will continue to drop as the Obama administration persists in its effective ban on new coal-fired power plants. The shift from coal to gas has brought a 10 percent decline in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from power plants since 2010, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, negating the political pressure for costly carbon cap-and-trade schemes. The shale gas industry also has created more than 600,000 jobs, stimulated economic growth and reduced consumer costs of products derived from natural gas, such as plastics, household chemicals and the fertilizers that make our food. But all these benefits pale in comparison to what could be achieved if the gas replaced oil instead of coal.  First, a little math. The best way to compare energy sources is to look at their cost per unit of heat, measured in British thermal units. The spot price of 1 million BTUs, expressed as mmbtu, derived from natural gas is about $4.30. The price of U.S. coal is more or less the same. At current oil prices, the price of 1 mmbtu derived from oil is roughly $17. That means that from a pure economic standpoint, the upside of replacing coal with natural gas is zero, while that of replacing oil with natural gas is $12.7 per mmbtu. Put differently, at current prices, the 3.5 trillion cubic feet of gas that the Energy Information Administration assumes the United States will be exporting annually starting next decade is valued at $15 billion. If this amount of gas stayed in the United States and were used to power cars and trucks, it would have displaced, depending on the technology, 3 million to 4 million barrels of oil a day, eliminating oil imports at the cost of $100 billion to $150 billion a year. Instead, the United States will be exporting this $15 billion worth of energy only to import an equivalent amount of energy at up to 10 times the cost. Does that make any sense?  The reason for this economic malpractice is that our transportation sector is wedded to oil. Natural gas landed in the power sector not necessarily because electricity is the most economic use of the commodity but because our grid and electric appliances are indifferent about the source of energy that goes into making the electrons they use. For a light bulb or coffee machine, electrons made from coal, gas, nuclear or solar are all the same.  Cars are a different story. They do care what source of energy goes into their tank because for the most part they are warrantied to run on nothing but petroleum fuels. This means that no matter how cheap and plentiful natural gas becomes, its pathway to our vehicles is blocked.  Although there are some efforts to increase the use of natural gas as an automotive fuel, they are limited to heavy-duty trucks and buses, and therefore will not get us close to capturing the full economic opportunity offered by the shale gas revolution. Consider this: On our current trajectory, according to the Energy Information Administration, the increased use of compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas in vehicles will offset only 3 percent of petroleum consumption in the transportation sector in 2040. This is a profoundly disappointing figure. If the natural gas bonanza is to benefit every American, it must penetrate the light-duty sector, where 60 percent of our transportation fuel is used.  One way of doing so is to reduce the cost of converting a light-duty gasoline car to CNG. Right now, that process comes out to roughly $10,000 per light-duty vehicle, more than three times the average price tag in other parts of the world. By streamlining the onerous regulatory requirements consumers are currently facing, the EPA could make this option widely available.  Another option is to turn the gas into gasoline and diesel in a process called gas-to-liquids. But for a GTL plant to make money, a barrel of oil has to cost about 16 times more than natural gas. That ratio is too high to expect over the long run, which is why Royal Dutch Shell recently abandoned its $20 billion GTL project in Louisiana.  A more fiscally prudent way of using natural gas in transportation is to open light-duty vehicles to run on a liquid fuel called methanol. This high-octane alcohol can be blended into gasoline, much in the way ethanol is blended. Properly adjusted “flexible fuel” vehicles, which cost automakers a $100 or so more to manufacture than gasoline-only cars, allow drivers to choose whether to run on methanol, gasoline or some combination of the fuels. If Congress provided automakers with the right incentives, within five years, a substantial part of America’s fleet would be capable of running on natural-gas-derived methanol — at no additional cost to taxpayers.  To be sure, in the coming years there will be times when natural gas prices inch up while oil prices decline, but it is highly unlikely that oil will ever become cheaper than natural gas per unit of energy. The arbitrage opportunity in shifting from oil to gas in the transportation sector is too appealing to let go. But as long as our cars are locked to gasoline, America’s natural gas will go to fuel power plants in Asia and Europe instead of cars at home. And while the sellers of the gas may be indifferent as to where it ends up, for Americans as a whole, this amounts to a scandalous waste of an opportunity.

	Since Russia began flexing its muscles in the Crimea and threatening Ukrainian sovereignty, policymakers in Washington, D.C., have called for some kind of action to punish President Vladimir Putin’s power grab.
	 
	There’s been talk of imposing economic sanctions against Russia, providing Ukraine with financial help, and even going after the foreign assets of Russian officials.
	 
	More recently, many Republicans have argued that one way to blunt Russia’s strength in the region, if not also Europe, would be to use gas—not the kind used in warfare, but the kind that supplies heat.
	 
	Natural gas is a major export of Russia’s, which was the world’s No. 1 producer of this natural resource until recently. It provides Ukraine with 60% of its natural gas supplies, and in a country where the winters are freezing, the importance of this trade relationship cannot be understated.
	 
	The Kremlin has been happy to use its natural gas exports to Ukraine as leverage whenever the former Soviet republic has gotten out of line in the eyes of Russian officials. Russia has even threatened to cut off this supply altogether during previous troubles between the two countries.
	 
	Russia also sells a lot of natural gas to Europe. In fact, its biggest customer is Germany, which buys more Russian natural gas than any other nation. Other European powers also purchase substantial amounts of the resource, including Italy, France and the United Kingdom.
	 
	This fact helps to explain why most European leaders have been muted in their discussion of the Ukrainian crisis. British Prime Minister David Cameron publicly stated that his government would not back the U.S. in imposing trade sanctions against Russia, possibly out of concern for how such a move would impact his country’s natural resource needs.
	 
	Nevertheless, Republicans on Capitol Hill have been hotly pushing the natural gas debate, arguing it is time for the U.S. to flex its own export muscles.
	 
	Thanks to the development of hydraulic fracturing (aka fracking), the U.S. these days is producing more natural gas than ever before—and has eclipsed Russia as the top producer globally.
	 
	This abundance has American companies wanting to sell their surpluses overseas. But because the U.S. has never before exported this resource, special plants and facilities need to be constructed at ports along the Gulf of Mexico, which require licenses from the federal government.
	 
	That’s why House Speaker John Boehner has been calling on the Obama administration to expedite the approval of said licenses. Doing so would put the U.S. in a position to start selling natural gas to Ukraine and Europe and cut into Russia’s power position vis-à-vis this vital trade, according to Boehner and other GOP lawmakers.
	 
	House Republicans aren’t the only ones talking gas in Washington. The Obama administration also has jumped on the bandwagon, according to Coral Davenport and Steven Erlanger of The New York Times, who wrote: “The crisis in Crimea is heralding the rise of a new era of American energy diplomacy, as the Obama administration tries to deploy the vast new supply of natural gas in the United States as a weapon to undercut the influence of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over Ukraine and Europe.”
	 
	However, neither Republicans nor the administration have said exactly how this export strategy would work. And that’s because it can’t.
	 
	It’s not like the U.S. has a trans-Atlantic pipeline ready to go for shipping natural gas to the other side of the world.
	 
	Or as Max Ehrenfreund noted at The Washington Post’s Wonkblog: The “gas would presumably get to Europe via the White House’s secret magical natural-gas teleportation machine, which can transport billions of cubic feet per day across the Atlantic using nothing but fairy dust and smiles.”
	 
	There is a way to sell and ship natural gas from U.S. drilling fields to other nations. But the process is expensive, complex and time-consuming—and in no way can it be done in a matter of weeks or even months to help Ukrainians.
	 
	Here’s why:
	 
	To export natural gas, companies first have to convert it into a liquid to facilitate transporting it. Once it becomes Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), it can be loaded onto special tankers and shipped across the Atlantic (or the Pacific, more on this in a moment).
	 
	But once it gets delivered to some far-flung port, LNG has to be reconverted into a gas to make it usable. That means the country receiving American LNG exports has to have a regasification plant.
	 
	Ukraine currently has zero regasification terminals (there’s talk of building one in the port city of Yuzhny, near Odessa, but it’s just talk).
	 
	So even if the U.S. had ships loaded with LNG ready to depart, which it doesn’t, there wouldn’t be any point in sending it to Ukraine because it couldn’t do anything with it.
	 
	So why is Boehner, not to mention Exxon Mobil, bringing up LNG export licenses in the Ukraine debate? Because there’s money to be made in Asia, where demand for LNG is very high.
	 
	Currently, five of the six largest importers of LNG are in Asia. They are (in order): Japan, South Korea, China, India and Taiwan.
	 
	Japan has been especially hungry for LNG since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated its nuclear power industry, forcing it to rely more on natural gas imports.
	 
	Asia’s demand for LNG is the real reason why Washington wants to ramp up U.S. exports, leaving Ukraine still at the mercy of Russia’s natural gas powerhouse, Gazprom.

Rand PaulRandal (Rand) Howard PaulOvernight Regulation: Trump’s former chemical safety nominee leaving EPA | Senate confirms Powell as Fed chair | NTSB 'gathering information' on Tesla crash Overnight Finance: Senate confirms Powell as Fed chair | Mulvaney declares 'new mission' for consumer bureau | Trump says solar tariffs will boost jobs Senate confirms Jerome Powell as Fed chairman MORE (R-Ky.) said that, if he were president, he would not let Russian President Vladimir Putin get away with his incursion into Ukraine. Paul on Monday described the movement of Russian troops into the Crimean Peninsula as a gross violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and argued it is the United States’ responsibility to take the lead in condemning it.“The real problem is that Russia’s president is not currently fearful or threatened in any way by America’s president, despite his country’s blatant aggression,” Paul wrote in a Time magazine op-ed. “But let me be clear: If I were president, I wouldn’t let Vladimir Putin get away with it.”Paul, fresh off a straw poll victory at the Conservative Political Action Conference, called on the administration to suspend all U.S. aid and loans to Ukraine. He argued that money would just end up in Russia's hands, given Ukraine's gas bill to Russian-owned Gazprom.Paul did not mention the House's passage last week of $1 billion loan guarantees to Ukraine.“Currently, these could have the counterproductive effect of rewarding Russia,” he said.  “Ukraine owes so much money to Russia that America would essentially be borrowing from China to give to Ukraine.”Paul argued the U.S. should immediately remove any obstacle preventing the U.S. from exporting natural gas to Europe. He argued that step would make Europe less dependent on Russian natural gas.""Because of so many of our current needless laws and regulations, President Obama has left Europe completely vulnerable because of its dependence on Russian oil and gas,"" Paul said.He also called for the immediate approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.He said he would also reinstate missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republican but would make sure European allies pay for it. Paul said turmoil around the world cannot let the United States forget it is “broke.”Paul also offered backing for economic sanctions and blocking Russian officials' visas, saying they should be imposed without delay. The White House announced sanctions last week but has yet to impose them on specific Russian entities or officials.He said the U.S. should take the lead in boycotting the G-8 summit in Sochi later this summer and remove Russia from the group if its troops still occupy Crimea at the time of the meeting. “This does not and should not require military action,” he said. “No one in the U.S. is calling for this. But it will require other actions and leadership, both of which President Obama unfortunately lacks.”Finally, Paul argued that the biggest threat to U.S. security is its debt.“Like Dwight Eisenhower, I believe the U.S. can actually be stronger by doing less,” he said. “Like Ronald Reagan, particularly regarding Russia, I also believe, ‘Don’t mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolve.’ ”View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."

564	Ed Davey has warned energy companies not to use the Ukrainian crisis as a n excuse to raise billsEnergy Secretary Ed Davey has ruled out energy companies hiking their prices due to the conflict in Ukraine as gas is typically bought 18 months in advance, and they should therefore be protected from short-term price fluctuations.As it stands roughly 30% of gas in Europe is supplied by Russia and analysts have warned that prices may increase dramatically if sanctions are imposed on Russia.Experts have, however, added that moderate winter temperatures mean many of Europe’s energy companies are in possession of larger than usual gas reserves.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Davey said: “The companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance. So they shouldn’t be using it as an excuse to put up people’s prices.“But we have seen when this crisis broke there was a spike in oil and gas prices. They’ve now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices.”The energy secretary added that the Ukrainian crisis illustrated the need for Britain to develop its own sources of energy.In this context, he commented on the need for additional energy to be produced via wind and nuclear power stations, as well as shale gas extraction.Increased competition likely to hurt big six suppliersEnergy bills have risen 55% in just 10 years ×  We use cookies to give you the best possible experience on our site, and so that we and third parties can show you more personalised ads, including adverts on other websites.

565	“We expect Russia to export gas to us at $368.5 per 1,000 cubic meters,” he told reporters in Kyiv on Sunday.Ukraine continues repaying debts for gas, and there are no reasons to halt gas exports, he said.“Gazprom has not been taking any steps of late. Our last year’s debt amounts to $1.5 billion. We managed to transfer about $100 million to Gazprom last week in repayment of our debt for January, and we have started repaying the debt for February which amounts to around $440 million,” Prodan said.Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the press on March 7 that Ukraine’s growing debts for Russian gas were generating a new transit crisis.“March 7 was the deadline for February payments. Gazprom had not received any debt payments by that time. Taking the discount for the first quarter into account, the overdue debt had increased to $1.89 billion” Miller said.“In fact, this means that Ukraine has stopped making payments for Russian gas, which is absolutely at odds with the contract and with international trade practice. We, on our part, have always honored our contract obligations and will continue doing so. But we cannot export gas for free. Ukraine will have to repay the debt and make regular payments for the current gas shipments, or face the risk of retuning to the situation that emerged at the start of 2009. We will keep the Russian government updated on the situation,” Miller said.The early 2009 transit crisis, when Europe remained cut from Russian gas supplies for 20 days, could re-emerge for the first time over the past five years. Found a spelling error?

567	"WASHINGTON (CBSDC/AP) — Former Vice President Dick Cheney says President Barack Obama is looking weak among global leaders as the Ukraine crisis continues to unfold.Speaking to CBS News’ “Face the Nation” Sunday, Cheney stated that the president “hasn’t gotten any credibility with our allies.”“We have created an image around the world not just for the Russians, of weakness, of indecisiveness,” Cheney said.The former VP under President George W. Bush said European Parliament members have told him it’s hard to back sanctions Obama is laying out for Russia after his handling of Syria last year.Cheney also called for Obama to reinstate the proposed Bush-era missile defense program in Poland and the Czech Republic that the president ended up scrapping in 2009. Ten ground-based interceptors would have been placed in Poland while a radar would’ve been placed inside the Czech Republic.“My answer is reinstate the ballistic missile defense program and policy. [Russian President Vladimir Putin] cares a lot about that,” Cheney told “Face the Nation.” “Conduct joint military exercises with our NATO friends close to the Russian border. Offer up equipment and training to the Ukrainian military.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday warned Secretary of State John Kerry that U.S. sanctions could “backfire,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. During a telephone call, Lavrov urged the U.S. not to take “hasty, poorly thought-out steps that could harm Russian-U.S. relations, especially concerning sanctions, which would unavoidably boomerang on the U.S. itself,” the statement said.In a separate statement on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry also warned the European Union that any sanctions it imposed would not go unanswered and would harm “the interests of the EU itself and its member nations.”Kerry underscored to Lavrov the importance of finding a constructive way to resolve the situation diplomatically, which would address the interests of the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the international community. Kerry and Lavrov agreed to continue to consult in the days ahead, according to the State Department.Declaring his determination not to let the Kremlin carve up Ukraine, Obama on Thursday slapped new visa restrictions on Russian and other opponents of Ukraine’s government in Kiev and authorized wider financial penalties against those involved in the military intervention or in stealing state assets. Obama emphasized his resolve in an hourlong telephone call with Putin, affirming his contention that Russia’s actions violate Ukraine’s sovereignty.Showing greater caution than Obama on sanctions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said European penalties against Russia depend “on how the diplomatic process progresses.” EU President Herman Van Rompuy said travel bans, asset freezes and the cancellation of an EU-Russia summit could still come. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk acknowledged “no enthusiasm” in Europe for economic sanctions.In some ways, the debate over sanctions echoes the Cold War doctrine of military strategy in which if two opponents fired off nuclear weapons, both sides would be annihilated.“There is a kind of mutually assured destruction relationship here,” said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. “Russia could say, ‘Well, we’re going to cut off your gas, and you guys can now scramble and buy extra gas and pay big prices.’“It would hurt the Europeans, but it also would cut off the biggest source of cash that flows into Russia today,” he said referring to oil and gas sales that account for about 60 percent of Russia’s exports and half of its government revenue. “So the Russians may threaten some things, but they also have to consider that if they do that what it would do to the Russian economy.”The State Department sought to allay fears that Europe might find itself short on Russian gas.“We understand that European gas inventories are well-above normal levels, due to a milder than usual winter, and could replace a loss of Russian exports for several months, if necessary,” spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. “Naturally, we take the energy security of our friends very seriously.”Ariel Cohen, an expert on Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said he doesn’t know whether the Europeans would be willing to impose tough sanctions, particularly against Russia’s banking and financial systems. Even if the Europeans don’t, the U.S. needs to take the lead or risk allowing Russia to alter current world order, he said.“Either we take a lead or the international system goes back to the chaos and high-risk levels that existed before World War I and between World War I and World War II,” he said. “This is very serious. I cannot emphasize that enough. People who talk about ‘Oh, we won’t get cheap gas from Russia’ or ‘The Russians will get angry’ — they do not look at it beyond the current geopolitical and international order.”If Russia grabs Crimea, Iran would be less willing to give up an ability to develop nuclear arms. “The message to Iran would be: If you have nuclear weapons you will not be attacked, your regime will be intact. If you don’t have nuclear weapons, your regime can be toppled and pieces of your territory can be taken away.”(TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

568	Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation’s sovereignty and an affront to the international community. His continuing occupation of Ukraine is completely unacceptable, and Russia’s President should be isolated for his actions.It is America’s duty to condemn these actions in no uncertain terms. It is our role as a global leader to be the strongest nation in opposing Russia’s latest aggression.Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation.This does not and should not require military action. No one in the U.S. is calling for this. But it will require other actions and leadership, both of which President Obama unfortunately lacks.I recommend a number of specific and decisive measures to punish Putin for his ongoing aggression.Economic sanctions and visa bans should be imposed and enforced without delay. I would urge our European allies to leverage their considerable weight with Russia and take the lead on imposing these penalties. I would do everything in my power to aggressively market and export America’s vast natural gas resources to Europe.I would immediately remove every obstacle or current ban blocking the export of American oil and gas to Europe, and I would lift restrictions on new oil and gas development in order to ensure a steady energy supply at home and so we can supply Europe with oil if it is interrupted from Ukraine.Because of so many of our current needless laws and regulations, President Obama has left Europe completely vulnerable because of its dependence on Russian oil and gas.I would support immediate construction of the Keystone Pipeline.It is important that Russia become economically isolated until all its forces are removed from Crimea and Putin pledges to act in accordance with the international standards of behavior that respect the rights of free people everywhere.We should also suspend American loans and aid to Ukraine because currently these could have the counterproductive effect of rewarding Russia. Ukraine owes so much money to Russia that America would essentially be borrowing from China to give to Russia.The U.S. should suspend its participation in this summer’s G-8 summit and take the lead in boycotting the event in Sochi. If Putin’s troops remain in Crimea at the time of the summit, Russia should be expelled from the group.I would reinstitute the missile-defense shields President Obama abandoned in 2009 in Poland and the Czech Republic, only this time, I would make sure the Europeans pay for it. The problem with the foreign policies of both Democratic and Republican administrations is that they never give a second thought to how America can afford what they implement.America is a world leader, but we should not be its policeman or ATM.At the end of the day, I still agree with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen — the greatest threat to America’s security is our national debt.Russia, the Middle East or any other troubled part of the world should never make us forget that the U.S. is broke. We weaken our security and defenses when we print money out of thin air or borrow from other countries to allegedly support our own.Like Dwight Eisenhower, I believe the U.S. can actually be stronger by doing less.Like Ronald Reagan, particularly regarding Russia, I also believe, “Don’t mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolve.”I stand with the people of Ukraine against subjugation and support their efforts to restore freedom. The Ukrainian people must be free to determine the fate and future of their own nation without unwarranted military or political intimidation from Russia.Reagan’s policy of “peace through strength” requires strength of the sort President Obama now fails to project. But what some American leaders, including some in my own party, often forget is that lasting peace was always Reagan’s ultimate objective.I have said, and some have taken exception, that too many U.S. leaders still think in Cold War terms and are quick to “tweak” the international community. This is true.But mutual respect and practical diplomacy is a two-way street, where Russia or any other nation should not be tweaking us, or their neighbors, either.Putin’s invasion and occupation of Crimea certainly now go far beyond tweaking.The U.S., in cooperation with the international community, should respond to Russia’s aggression with action.The Budapest Memorandum said that Russia wouldn’t violate the integrity of Ukraine, but now it has. There is no realistic military option in this conflict, at least for the U.S. But this does not mean there aren’t options, many of which I’ve outlined here.The real problem is that Russia’s President is not currently fearful or threatened in any way by America’s President, despite his country’s blatant aggression.But let me be clear: If I were President, I wouldn’t let Vladimir Putin get away with it.Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky	Business

Martins was subpoenaed by the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises last month. He's flatly denied a claim made before the inquiry that he was at a meeting with key figures implicated in state capture. Suzanne Daniels, suspended head of Eskom's legal department, told the inquiry last year that she was at a meeting with Ajay Gupta, Duduzane Zuma and Salim Essa near Melrose Arch last year. Martins, she said, was there too. Daniels said that her hosts wanted to know about former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe's court proceedings.The ANC is demanding that the Eskom board chaired by Dr Ben Ngubane be held accountable for reinstating the power utility’s controversial ex-chief executive, Brian Molefe, to facilitate what the party believes is looting and corruption. On Thursday, Pretoria High Court judges Elias Matojane, Hans Fabricius and Segopotje Mphahlele handed down a scathing ruling ordering Molefe to pay back more than R10.3million of the R30.1m that the Eskom Provident and Pension Fund paid him within 10 days. The full bench found that the utility’s decision to waive penalties and buy Molefe an extra 13 years of service, totalling R30.1m, after only 15 months of service at the age of 50, stretched incredulity and was unlawful for want of compliance with its provident and pension fund’s rules.This week‚ Singh was questioned by Parliament over his role in the Gupta family’s capture of the state and the looting of billions of rand from the fiscus. Asked if had seen the Guptas at the hotel‚ Singh said that if he had‚ it would have been purely coincidental. “I think I have seen the Gupta brothers in passing in Dubai. I have never had any formal meetings with them in Dubai. But if you are staying in the same hotel at the same time you will probably see each other.” Grover's name also emerged in the controversy over government's Vrede dairy farm project‚ which has been exposed as nothing more than a looting ground for the Gupta family and their associates - with little to no oversight wasThe workings of South Africa's ""multi-billionaire class"" should also go under the magnifying glass during the inquiry into state capture, the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) said on Thursday.

574	"Joel South and Taylor Muckerman, The Motley FoolRussia's nationalized Gazprom is accusing Ukraine of faltering on payments for previously delivered natural gas, increasing the threat of a supply disruption to the troubled country and the European Union. Events  this week sparked plenty of commentary on the United States using its vast natural gas resources as a diplomatic weapon to soften Russia's hand.While the United States is currently sitting on an ocean of inexpensive natural gas, exporting the fuel will not weaken Russia's resource control over Europe for three reasons. First, the U.S. government could cut all the red tape in exporting LNG, but commercial interests are not going to ship to Europe when much healthier margins are made by exporting to Asia. Even if prices skyrocketed in Europe, LNG regasification and natural gas storage is severely inadequacy. Finally, Russian natural gas is produced from conventional wells, making it the cost leader, effectively giving Russia command over market share and holding the winning hand. Another shot for AmericaImagine a company that rents a very specific and valuable piece of machinery for $41,000 per hour.

576	 Condoleezza Rice was secretary of state from 2005 to 2009. “Meet Viktor Yanu­kovych, who is running for the presidency of Ukraine.” Vladimir Putin and I were standing in his office at the presidential dacha in late 2004 when Yanu­kovych suddenly appeared from a back room. Putin wanted me to get the point. He’s my man, Ukraine is ours — and don’t forget it. The “Ukrainian problem” has been brewing for some time between the West and Russia. Since Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, the United States and Europe have tried to convince Russia that the vast territory should not be a pawn in a great-power conflict but rather an independent nation that could chart its own course. Putin has never seen it that way. For him, Kiev’s movement toward the West is an affront to Russia in a zero-sum game for the loyalty of former territories of the empire. The invasion and possible annexation of Crimea on trumped-up concerns for its Russian-speaking population is his answer to us. The immediate concern must be to show Russia that further moves will not be tolerated and that Ukraine’s territorial integrity is sacrosanct. Diplomatic isolation, asset freezes and travel bans against oligarchs are appropriate. The announcement of air defense exercises with the Baltic states and the movement of a U.S. destroyer to the Black Sea bolster our allies, as does economic help for Ukraine’s embattled leaders, who must put aside their internal divisions and govern their country. The longer-term task is to answer Putin’s statement about Europe’s post-Cold War future. He is saying that Ukraine will never be free to make its own choices — a message meant to reverberate in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states — and that Russia has special interests it will pursue at all costs. For Putin, the Cold War ended “tragically.” He will turn the clock back as far as intimidation through military power, economic leverage and Western inaction will allow. After Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, the United States sent ships into the Black Sea, airlifted Georgian military forces from Iraq back to their home bases and sent humanitarian aid. Russia was denied its ultimate goal of overthrowing the democratically elected government, an admission made to me by the Russian foreign minister. The United States and Europe could agree on only a few actions to isolate Russia politically. But even those modest steps did not hold. Despite Russia’s continued occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the diplomatic isolation waned and then the Obama administration’s “reset” led to an abrupt revision of plans to deploy missile defense components in the Czech Republic and Poland. Talk of Ukraine and Georgia’s future in NATO ceased. Moscow cheered. This time has to be different. Putin is playing for the long haul, cleverly exploiting every opening he sees. So must we, practicing strategic patience if he is to be stopped. Moscow is not immune from pressure. This is not 1968, and Russia is not the Soviet Union. The Russians need foreign investment; oligarchs like traveling to Paris and London, and there are plenty of ill-gotten gains stored in bank accounts abroad; the syndicate that runs Russia cannot tolerate lower oil prices; neither can the Kremlin’s budget, which sustains subsidies toward constituencies that support Putin. Soon, North America’s bounty of oil and gas will swamp Moscow’s capacity. Authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline and championing natural gas exports would signal that we intend to do precisely that. And Europe should finally diversify its energy supply and develop pipelines that do not run through Russia.Many of Russia’s most productive people, particularly its well-educated youth, are alienated from the Kremlin. They know that their country should not be only an extractive industries giant. They want political and economic freedoms and the ability to innovate and create in today’s knowledge-based economy. We should reach out to Russian youth, especially students and young professionals, many of whom are studying in U.S. universities and working in Western firms. Democratic forces in Russia need to hear American support for their ambitions. They, not Putin, are Russia’s future.Most important, the United States must restore its standing in the international community, which has been eroded by too many extended hands of friendship to our adversaries, sometimes at the expense of our friends. Continued inaction in Syria, which has strengthened Moscow’s hand in the Middle East, and signs that we are desperate for a nuclear agreement with Iran cannot be separated from Putin’s recent actions. Radically declining U.S. defense budgets signal that we no longer have the will or intention to sustain global order, as does talk of withdrawal from Afghanistan whether the security situation warrants it or not. We must not fail, as we did in Iraq, to leave behind a residual presence. Anything less than the American military’s requirement for 10,000 troops will say that we are not serious about helping to stabilize that country. The notion that the United States could step back, lower its voice about democracy and human rights and let others lead assumed that the space we abandoned would be filled by democratic allies, friendly states and the amorphous “norms of the international community.” Instead, we have seen the vacuum being filled by extremists such as al-Qaeda reborn in Iraq and Syria; by dictators like Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Iran and Russia, murders his own people; by nationalist rhetoric and actions by Beijing that have prompted nationalist responses from our ally Japan; and by the likes of Vladimir Putin, who understands that hard power still matters.These global developments have not happened in response to a muscular U.S. foreign policy: Countries are not trying to “balance” American power. They have come due to signals that we are exhausted and disinterested. The events in Ukraine should be a wake-up call to those on both sides of the aisle who believe that the United States should eschew the responsibilities of leadership. If it is not heeded, dictators and extremists across the globe will be emboldened. And we will pay a price as our interests and our values are trampled in their wake.

Four central European countries are asking the United States to make it easier for them to import natural gas from the U.S. so they can reduce their reliance on Russia.Ambassadors from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia made their appeal in a letter to the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner.They wrote that U.S. natural gas would be welcome in central and eastern Europe and would be a key U.S. interest in the region.Previous disputes over gas payments between Russia and Ukraine have caused Russia to cut off supplies. The same pipelines that bring Russian gas to Ukraine also supply eastern Europe, creating shortages there.Russia Friday warned the interim Ukrainian government of another possible shutdown over unpaid gas bills.Boehner said Saturday he hopes President Barack Obama will direct the secretary of energy to immediately approve pending natural gas export requests so America's friends in Europe and around the world can reduce their dependency on Russia.The White House has said that a mild European winter has created above average gas supplies and that any new exports would be unlikely to reach Europe before the end of 2015.Some information for this report comes from AP and Reuters.

580	THE Australian dollar is lower after Russia threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine and Europe.At 0630 AEDT on Monday, the local unit was trading at 90.37 US cents.Source:ThinkStockTHE Australian dollar is lower as more worries about tensions between Russia and Ukraine overshadow positive US economic data.At 0700 AEDT on Monday, the local unit was trading at 90.36 US cents, down from 90.90 cents on Friday.Russian state company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine’s new government by warning that if Ukraine doesn’t pay its debts, Russia could cut off wider supplies to Europe.BK Asset Management managing director Kathy Lien said markets were initially positive about data showing that 175,000 jobs were added to the US economy in February but that changed after Russia made its threat.“Equities traded sharply higher on the relief that non-farm payrolls did not miss expectations for the third month in a row,” she said.“The sell-off was triggered by the one major uncertainty that has been hanging over the markets for the past few weeks and that is Ukraine.“Considering that the Russian government owns a controlling interest in Gazprom, the world’s largest single gas producer, this threat is clearly representative of political posturing.” Ms Lien said the strong US employment data increases expectation that the US Federal Reserve will continue winding back its economic stimulus programs, which will further boost the US dollar and put downward pressure on the Australian dollar.###A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

583	"Visa bans, freezing assets, boycotts: There is no lack of suggestions of how to tone down Russian aggression. But what good would sanctions do? Politicians are growing increasingly skeptical. DW takes a look. The European Union has said it is halting visa talks with Russia following an emergency summit of the bloc's leaders where they discussed ways to punish Russia for its recent exploits on the Crimean Peninsula. If Russia continues to reject negotiations, further measures are to be taken, which could entail economic sanctions. It didn't take long for the Kremlin to respond. Any sanction will be met with countermeasures from Moscow, an official government statement declared. The United States has already imposed visa bans on targeted Russians and warned of freezing their assets. In response, Russia has threatened to stop reciprocal weapons inspections. The chimes of boycotts flashin' According to news magazine Der Spiegel, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her attendance at the upcoming G8 summit in Sochi depends on developments in Crimea. If the Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia, which Merkel has openly called ""illegal"" and in ""violation of Ukraine's constitution,"" goes ahead, the chancellor won't be in Sochi in June.Emergency summits have thus far produced only watered down sanctionsMichael Fuchs, conservative politician and deputy parliamentary head of Merkel's CDU, has suggested another form of sanction to force Putin's hand: take away, or at least call into question, Russia's hosting of the 2018 Soccer World Cup. That suggestion has been criticized by left-leaning Social Democrat and Left Party politicians as ""soccer diplomacy."" But calls for some kind of sanctions are growing ever louder; at the same time, criticism is also reverberating that this form of conflict resolution is simply wrong. Even EU Parliament President Martin Schulz, himself a German Social Democrat, has expressed doubt as to whether such words will ultimately bring Putin to the negotiating table. Watered down sanctions? Be that as it may, the sanctions that have been addressed are seen by many as rather mild. In a commentary in the Swiss daily Neue Zürcher Zeitung, one journalist remarked that the proposed measures are weaker than those hurled at Switzerland following its referendum on capping immigration. Some German politicians have said that any sanctions at all would miss the mark, resulting merely in further dividing the two sides. Gregor Gysi, parliamentary head of the Left Party, rejects imposing sanctions against Russia altogether: ""You can perhaps impress a weak partner with sanctions, but not Russia. It has China on its side, and we must not underestimate this,"" Gysi told German public radio.Martin Wansleben is happy about Germany's careful course""Such a situation lends itself to saber rattling, and as soon as we shout 'sanctions' then Putin will make his own threat,"" Gysi added, pointing out that the EU should also keep in mind its dependency on Russian gas. The EU's careful stance on the accelerating Ukraine crisis has garnered praise from German economic representatives. ""It's quite right to promote de-escalation,"" said Martin Wansleben, head of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry. ""We are communicating not only with Putin but with all of Russia,"" he added. ""I think it's smart to say that we're in a position to talk, but at the end of the day we are willing to compromise."" Wansleben also pointed out that the dive taken by the rouble since the outbreak of the crisis can be seen as an indirect effect of the sanctions already pledged. Close economic ties Economic sanctions would be senseless for Germany, because they would endanger billions in investments. Trade volumes between Germany and Russia in 2013 were over 75 billion euros ($104 billion). Around 6,000 German companies currently do business in Russia, and around 300,000 jobs could be jeopardized. And then there is the financial sector: European banks have around 180 billion euros in Russia at the moment.Germany currently gets 35 percent of its oil and gas imports from RussiaEU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger's concerns of a potential escalation between Russia and Europe are perhaps the most acute. Sanctions, he said, ""would negatively affect Europe's fragile economic renewal,"" adding that Europe needed to find alternatives to Russian gas. As far as Germany's transition to renewable energy is concerned, Oettinger said it would be impossible without Russian gas. At the moment, Germany receives 35 percent of its oil and gas imports from Russia. Germany is divided as to whether the West should impose sanctions on Russia. A recent Emnid survey indicates that 45 percent of Germans are against the sanctions, with 44 percent in support. The results were significantly different when the question was put differently: 54 percent of Germans said they wouldn't be willing to help Ukraine if sanctions led to higher gas bills.EU parliament chief Schulz has called for swift action to end the Crimean crisis before a March 16 referendum. His proposal: guarantee Russia's naval bases in Crimea and put more economic pressure on Moscow to negotiate. (09.03.2014)

584	"Persisting tension between Russia and Ukraine in the Crimean peninsula has painted a grim picture for the autonomous region; an escalating crisis could lead to political and economic turmoil for both countries. Although the United States will likely remain unaffected in the short term, a prolonged or growing crisis could lead to long-term economic consequences, including trade sanctions and spikes in commodity prices.Short term: Much to do about nothing
While Russia’s occupation of Crimea has pressured already heated circumstances in the region, the immediate consequences for the US economy are minimal. Both Russia and Ukraine, which is nicknamed “the breadbasket of Europe,” are major international exporters of agricultural commodities. Consequently, global commodity prices jumped following news that Russia had occupied the Crimean peninsula. The United States Department of Agriculture projects that 10.4% of global wheat production and 16.7% of wheat exports will come from the two countries. Both are also important producers of coarse grains such as corn, barley, sorghum and rye, accounting for 18.3% of global exports. Fears that grain exports from the region could be interrupted caused agricultural commodity prices to spike.The threat of armed conflict has also led to increases in global energy prices. Russia is one of the world’s largest natural gas suppliers, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global production and exports, according to the latest available data from the International Energy Agency.  Russia’s oil production is similarly important to global supply, accounting for 13.5% of the world’s crude oil production and 11.9% of total exports.Fortunately for consumers and businesses in the United States, neither is likely to be affected in the near future. Producers are hedged against short-term fluctuations of global commodity prices, making it unlikely that the current conflict will affect prices for consumers at the gas pump or at the grocery store.Long term: A tale of two stories
A continuation or escalation of the current crisis between Russia and Ukraine, could lead to potential sanctions and asset freezes and subsequently, global economic tremors. However, the direct consequences for the US economy are minimal. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is a significant US trade partner, cumulatively accounting for just 1.1% of the total export/import flow for the United States. Still, a number of domestic industries and companies could suffer if economic relations between the United States, Russia and Ukraine are disrupted.Russia is a growing market and supply chain partner for the US automotive, aerospace and energy sectors. Last year, US auto manufacturers exported $1.2 billion worth of goods to Russia, according to the United States International Trade Commission (ITC). General Motors, the largest auto manufacturer in the United States, sold 258,000 vehicles in Russia, giving it a 9.1% share of the total market in the country. The company has also invested in significant projects in Russia, including an expansion of its St. Petersburg plant, which is expected to increase its production capacity from 98,000 vehicles to 230,000 by 2015. Economic sanctions against Russia, or Russian restrictions in response, could jeopardize the position of US automakers in what is estimated as Europe’s largest auto market.Aerospace companies like Boeing also stand to lose from deterioration in trade relations.  Aerospace products comprised the number one US export to Russia last year, according to the ITC, totaling $1.8 billion. While accounting for only 1.7% of total US aerospace exports, denial into Russia’s rapidly growing market (exports grew at an average annual rate of 27.2% in the five years to 2013) could hurt companies US companies. The loss of alloy supplies from Russia would have an even more damaging effect on US aerospace firms. According to Bloomberg, Boeing sources about 35.0% of its titanium from Russian VSMPO-AVISMA and has plans to invest $27.0 billion in the country in the coming decades.Among US companies in danger, major US energy players, like ExxonMobil and Chevron, could lose billions of dollars invested in Russia. Exxon’s operations in the country are plentiful: The company manages the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas production and exploration consortium, and in 2011, entered into an agreement with Russian oil giant Rosneft to develop oil deposits on the Artic Shelf and in Western Siberia. However, potential sanctions could derail this agreement worth as much as $500.0 billion.However, while direct US exposure to Russia and Ukraine is minimal, a prolonged conflict could have serious indirect consequences for US consumers, businesses and investors. Because Russia and Ukraine are significant agricultural producers, global grain prices could skyrocket if exports are disrupted, forcing investors, governments and end users to scramble to secure supplies. In turn, US consumers could end up paying more for staple foods and other products that use grain. On the upside, US grain producers would face less competition and therefore, higher profit margins.Furthermore, Russia is one of the largest exporters of oil and natural gas, with a significant portion of its supply piped through Ukraine. If supply is disrupted, or if fear of disruption persists, global energy prices could climb, leading to higher oil and gas prices in the United States. In turn, consumers and business would experience higher transportation costs, and subsequently, spikes in the prices of most goods. Fortunately for US consumers, because the United States lacks the necessary infrastructure to export is growing supply of natural gas, the domestic natural gas market is relatively insulated from spikes in natural gas prices.Due to the region’s essential role in the flow of global grains and energy, any disruption in trade relations will most likely not be aimed at these commodities. Only under certain circumstances will the supply of these commodities be impacted (i.e. if military conflict occurs, or if Russia coerces Ukraine by shutting down its supply of natural gas and oil). Overall, though the conflict is bound to influence the position of certain companies, the threat of large-scale economic turmoil is minimal."	Business

587	"Fears of economic complications, retaliation underlay potential sanctionsWASHINGTON (AP) — Underlying the talk about taking harsh punitive measures against Russia for its military incursion into Ukraine are economic complications and worries that sanctions levied against Moscow could, in the words of the Kremlin, “boomerang” back on the U.S. and Europe.
Heavier U.S. and European Union sanctions could sting Russia’s already slow-growing economy and hurt its financial sector. But Moscow could retaliate and seize American and other foreign assets or cut exports of natural gas to Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russia for energy.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday warned Secretary of State John Kerry that U.S. sanctions could “backfire,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. During a telephone call, Lavrov urged the U.S. not to take “hasty, poorly thought-out steps that could harm Russian-U.S. relations, especially concerning sanctions, which would unavoidably boomerang on the U.S. itself,” the statement said.
In a separate statement on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry also warned the European Union that any sanctions it imposed would not go unanswered and would harm “the interests of the EU itself and its member nations.”
Declaring his determination not to let the Kremlin carve up Ukraine, President Barack Obama on Thursday slapped new visa restrictions on Russian and other opponents of Ukraine’s government in Kiev and authorized wider financial penalties against those involved in the military intervention or in stealing state assets. Obama emphasized his resolve in an hourlong telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, affirming his contention that Russia’s actions violate Ukraine’s sovereignty.
On Capitol Hill, both chambers of Congress looked to advance legislation imposing hard-hitting sanctions on Russia.
Obama hailed U.S. cooperation with the European Union, which on Thursday suspended talks with Putin’s government on a wide-ranging economic agreement and on granting Russian citizens visa-free travel within the 28-nation bloc. But Europe’s presidents and prime ministers remain divided on taking more drastic steps such as freezing assets and issuing travel bans on Russian officials.
European hesitancy reflected the reality that targeting influential Russian businessmen or major Russian companies would also harm Europe’s economic interests. U.S. trade with Russia is less than one-tenth of Europe’s.
Russian investors hold assets worth billions in European banks, particularly in Britain, which is highly protective of its financial sector, and major exporters such as Germany and the Netherlands have far more at stake than the United States in Russia’s consumer economy.
Showing greater caution than Obama on sanctions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said European penalties against Russia depend “on how the diplomatic process progresses.” EU President Herman Van Rompuy said travel bans, asset freezes and the cancellation of an EU-Russia summit could still come. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk acknowledged “no enthusiasm” in Europe for economic sanctions.
In some ways, the debate over sanctions echoes the Cold War doctrine of military strategy in which if two opponents fired off nuclear weapons, both sides would be annihilated.
“There is a kind of mutually assured destruction relationship here,” said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. “Russia could say, ‘Well, we’re going to cut off your gas, and you guys can now scramble and buy extra gas and pay big prices.’
“It would hurt the Europeans, but it also would cut off the biggest source of cash that flows into Russia today,” he said referring to oil and gas sales that account for about 60 percent of Russia’s exports and half of its government revenue. “So the Russians may threaten some things, but they also have to consider that if they do that what it would do to the Russian economy.”
The State Department sought to allay fears that Europe might find itself short on Russian gas.
“We understand that European gas inventories are well-above normal levels, due to a milder than usual winter, and could replace a loss of Russian exports for several months, if necessary,” spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. “Naturally, we take the energy security of our friends very seriously.”
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, saw an opening for U.S. gas producers. He called on Obama to fast-track approval of U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, claiming the Energy Department has a slow approval process that amounts to a de facto ban on American natural gas exports.
The Energy Department has given final approval to one of about two dozen proposed liquefied natural gas export terminals in the past two years. Five other projects have received conditional backing.
However, even if the Energy Department approved all the pending permits from companies seeking to export natural gas, fuel could not begin flowing overseas for several years. A project in Sabine Pass, La., is tentatively scheduled to open in late 2015, but most others are not expected to begin operations until 2017 or later.
Ariel Cohen, an expert on Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said he doesn’t know whether the Europeans would be willing to impose tough sanctions, particularly against Russia’s banking and financial systems. Even if the Europeans don’t, the U.S. needs to take the lead or risk allowing Russia to alter current world order, he said.
“Either we take a lead or the international system goes back to the chaos and high-risk levels that existed before World War I and between World War I and World War II,” he said. “This is very serious. I cannot emphasize that enough. People who talk about ‘Oh, we won’t get cheap gas from Russia’ or ‘The Russians will get angry’ — they do not look at it beyond the current geopolitical and international order.”
If Russia grabs Crimea, Iran would be less willing to give up an ability to develop nuclear arms. “The message to Iran would be: If you have nuclear weapons you will not be attacked, your regime will be intact. If you don’t have nuclear weapons, your regime can be toppled and pieces of your territory can be taken away.”

588	"Returns as of 1/27/2018Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Returns as of 1/27/2018Russian gas giant Gazprom (NASDAQOTH:OGZPY) said in an annual meeting with investors in London this week that Europe will become even more dependent on the company's gas supplies in years to come.  Gazprom's comments came as tensions over the crisis in Ukraine continue. While tensions have eased slightly this week, there are concerns over Gazprom's gas supplies to Europe that flow through Ukraine. However, any potential cut in gas supply will hurt Gazprom more than Europe, both in the near term and the long term. Europe more secureIn 2009, following contract disputes, Russia shut gas supplies to Ukraine, which ultimately affected downstream customers in Europe. Earlier this week, Gazprom said that gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine were normal. However, gas supplies could be affected after the company said that it will raise gas prices for Ukraine from the start of April as the country has failed to pay its debts. Any disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine could lead to a shutdown of gas supplies to Ukraine, which will have an impact on supplies to downstream customers in Europe. But can Europe cope with that? Although some 15% of Europe's total gas imports come through Ukraine, the continent is lot more secured this time than 2009. In 2009, the gas supplies were cut in January, the coldest month in Europe. Additionally, Europe wasn't prepared for such a cut at the time. However, this time things are very different. The cuts to gas supplies, if they happen, will be in spring this time. Also, this spring season in Europe follows on the heels of an unusually mild winter. As a result, Europe's natural gas inventories are at their highest levels. According to Reuters, central Europe, which relies heavily on Russian gas supplies, has sufficient inventories. It is the same case with Germany, Europe's biggest gas consumer. In addition, the shale boom in the U.S. has meant that the country now has record natural gas production. This has freed up LNG shipments on the global market, which could end up in Europe in case there is a shortage due to Russian supply cuts.Gazprom believes otherwiseAlthough the latest crisis has once again raised questions over Russian gas supplies to Europe, Gazprom believes that the continent will become even more dependent on its gas supplies in the next few years. Speaking at an annual meeting with investors in London earlier this week, Gazprom's deputy head Alexander Medvedev said that the company has increased its share in European markets because Europe's domestic production has fallen in countries such as Britain and Norway.In 2013, Gazprom accounted for 30% of Europe's total gas imports, compared to 25.6% in 2012. While Europe heavily relies on Russian gas at the moment, events such as those in the Ukraine will likely prompt the continent to start looking at alternative sources for its gas supplies.As I noted in a previous article, the U.S. should take this opportunity to further its geopolitical interests by removing restrictions on natural gas exports to its allies in Europe. The shale boom, as I noted before, has also freed up LNG shipments from Qatar and Australia, which could end up in Europe. While Europe might be relying on Gazprom right now for its gas supplies, the situation will change dramatically if Russia continues to use the company to further its geopolitical interests.Additionally, Gazprom is not in a position to lose revenue from Europe. Gazprom relies on Europe even more than Europe does on the company. Europe accounts for about three-quarters of Gazprom's export sales, and Gazprom therefore stands to lose more in the long term. The company will also lose in the near-term if there are any supply cuts to Ukraine. According to Natural Gas Europe, 55% of gas exports to Europe were shipped via Ukraine. If Ukraine's gas supplies are disrupted, Gazprom and Europe have the option to reduce Ukrainian share to a third and fully load the Nord Stream pipeline. But Natural Gas Europe notes that in such a case, Gazprom will only fulfill two-thirds of its contractual obligations. In other words, Gazprom stands to lose a third of its revenue in the near term if supplies to Ukraine are cut. Leveraging state-run companiesState-run natural resource companies have always been used for political gains. However, invariably, such moves have ended in a disaster for the company. Remember PDVSA of Venezuela and Pemex of Mexico? More recently, the Brazilian government has used Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) for subsidizing fuel in the country. The result has been a weakening Petrobras. The company is the world's most indebted oil and gas company. Only a few years ago, Petrobras was seen as the next big thing in the oil and gas sector. However, the company has failed to live up to the expectations, thanks to some disastrous energy policy. Contrast this with BP Plc (NYSE:BP), which was written off after Gulf of Mexico oil spill but has managed to make a strong comeback in the past year. Europe may be relying heavily on Gazprom at the moment, but the shale boom has changed the dynamics of the global energy market. Europe now has alternative sources for its gas supplies and can secure its energy needs even more if the U.S. removes restrictions on gas imports. Gazprom, therefore, stands to lose more if Russia continues to use the company to serve its geopolitical interests. The conflict in Ukraine will hurt Gazprom in the long-term, as well as potentially in the near term.Varun Chandan Arora has no position in any stocks mentioned.

""I think we should consider targeting some of the oligarchs around him that are his enablers and he is their enablers.""Ryan suggested imposing travel bans and economic sanctions against Putin's wealthy domestic allies, including targeting overseas holdings ""that are illicitly gained through this kleptocracy of the Russian economy.""Ryan also urged the Obama administration to expand natural gas exports to Europe to help the continent become less dependent on Russian gas and oil -- a significant part of Russia's economy.""We are a nation with vast energy reserves and potential, but with a government that is seen as hostile toward developing those energy reserves, let alone exporting those energy reserves,"" Ryan said.""If our government changed its tune on that, if we told Europe we are going to green-light these languishing [natural gas] permit applications for exporting … to Europe, that could do a lot to send the signals that we are intent on loosening Russian's grip on its energy to Europe and that we're going to be a reliable ally to loosen their grip.""He said the House will move forward on legislation to expedite the permitting process for U.S. natural gas exports to Europe."

592	Reuters Staff3 Min ReadMILAN, March 8 (Reuters) - The crisis in Ukraine does not yet pose a threat to gas supplies but it is a wake up call for Europe to rethink its energy strategy, the head of Italian oil and gas group Eni said on Saturday. In an interview with Italian daily La Stampa, Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said the standoff between Ukraine and Russia would not have an impact on gas supplies thanks partly to mild weather across Europe. “But certainly if the tension continues I do have a few worries for next year,” he said. On Friday, Russian gas giant Gazprom warned it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on Ukraine’s supporters in Europe, which gets half its Russian gas through the country. “In any case, precisely in light of this crisis, Europe needs to rethink its energy strategy,” he said. Gazprom halted gas supplies to Ukraine over unpaid bills at the beginning of 2009 prompting cuts to supplies of Russian gas to Europe during a cold winter. Scaroni said that Italy’s gas supply structure meant it was in a position to overcome any crisis involving a single supplier, albeit at an extra cost. “But if another one (supplier) went down the problems would be serious,” he said. Italy, which imports around 90 percent of its gas needs, has long-term supply agreements in place with Russia, Algeria, Libya and the Netherlands. In 2012 Russia accounted for around a third of overall imports but data from gas transport grid operator Snam  on Friday showed Russian volumes were more than half of daily flows. Violence in Libya has reduced supplies into Italy and last year Eni agreed to take less gas from Algeria as part of a renegotiation of its long-term gas contracts with the country. Eni, Italy’s biggest listed company, is one of Europe’s biggest gas wholesalers. Scaroni said it was improbable Russia would suspend its gas supplies through Ukraine unless there was the threat of actual war between the two countries, which he believed unlikely. “The Ukrainians make $3 billion a year for the transit of Russian gas through their country. For them that’s a large amount,” he said. Scaroni, who will be meeting with Gazprom’s head on Tuesday, said it was crucial for Russia to be reliable as a supplier to its Western clients.

593	Press TV has conducted an interview with Geoffrey Steinberg, with the Executive Intelligence Review from Washington D.C., to shed more light on the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine. - Geoffrey Steinberg, there seems to be some challenges in definition when it comes to Ukraine, in particular Crimea, of what is legal and what is not.Why do not you review, if you can, the situation there because as of now we are looking at 10 days from now that this referendum is going to take place. Of course you have the interim government there, saying that this is illegal and of course you have Crimea along with Russia saying that Crimea wants to join the Russian Federation.- Well, I think that you have to go back one step and raise the question of whether or not the current government in Kiev is, in fact, legal.If you go back to the last week of February when you had three European Union foreign ministers going to Kiev and joined by an emissary from Russia as well, an agreement was reached to, basically, establish an interim government with President Yanukovych still in and with a number of issues to be handled through diplomatic means and then you had violent protesters in the Maidan including people who are associated with some organizations that can be fairly called neo-Nazi, who used force including activating sniper attacks against both police and other demonstrators to, basically, affect a change in government through military force in violation of the very agreement that Yanukovych and the three opposition party heads and the European foreign ministers had all signed.So if you do not look at those events first, it is really not fair to evaluate the events in Crimea as if they were the starting point of the crisis in Ukraine.Remember again that this all began were protests were activated against Yanukovych when he refused, back in November, to sign the European Union Eastern Alliance Partnership Agreement, which was quite frankly a bad deal from the standpoint of Ukrainian sovereign interest including severe economic problems that would have been precipitated had they gone along and signed that.So this is not a simple...issue and you cannot selectively pick something that has occurred ....into the process and declare that that is illegal when the whole character of the current Kiev government violates the international law because a legitimately elected, undisputed legitimately elected government was overthrown by violence.So unless there is a willingness to step back and look at the whole picture, I see this going in a very dangerous direction, possibly even leading to a war confrontation between NATO and Russia, which would be horrific.- Perhaps you are not also aware, as I think, as I gather from Peter Sinnott, that the EU has come out and they have announced what they have called these sanctions, this is pretty much a threatening sanction, as they called it. They are going to target Russian officials, visa bans; they have joined the United States on that. This was the result of the meeting that took place in Brussels. It also has threatened, and I underline the word threatened, about the broad range of economic sanctions should Russia embark on further steps to destabilize Ukraine.How did that happen? I was having the impression that the EU was pretty much, as our guest there said, economically somewhat obviously reliant on Russia and of course the big question about gas comes into play here, of the amount of gas that Russia provides the EU countries with.- Well, first of all I think that Peter (Sinnott) is right that left to their own devices, the European Union would very much like to, number one: avoid being drawn into major economic sanctions against Russia because quite frankly the Russian have a lot of economic leverage.The City of London handles a great deal of Russian money, both oligarchical money and Russian state funds and those banks are not in a very good shape and a sanctions regime which cut off the flow of those funds into the City of London and the other financial centers in Europe, could have a tremendously disastrous impact because, frankly, the European banking and financial system is on a very weak ground.Secondly, Secretary Kerry was just in Kiev and he announced that the US is prepared to give a billion dollars in loan guarantees to Ukraine and it is already widely acknowledged that most of that money is likely to go to Russia in the form of payments for the increased cost of Russian natural gas to Ukraine because the especial discount prices, negotiated between Putin and Yanukovych, are going to be cut off in April.Yesterday the Russians also announced that they were going to hold off on deliveries of fuel for nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and Ukraine because of the “security situation” and Ukraine has 15 nuclear power plants that get most of their reprocessed fuel from Russia.So, I think that if we get into the game of the economic warfare it is very questionable who is going to come out on top. I think that the Europeans...- We are in the middle of it. The US has come out and announced these sanctions. The other ones being threats of, as I mentioned, targeted sanctions as well as a broad range of economic measures.They have not announced specifically what those may be; so we are on that road, we are there. So what is going to happen?- Well, let me just finish my thought. The US carries a great deal of leverage with the Europeans and I am sure that various US officials, if not Secretary Kerry, then certainly National Security Advisor Rice and others, were working the phones, maybe even President Obama himself; so that the gap between the European action and the US action was as narrowed as possible.Until we see the content of the sanctions coming from the Europeans, one has to reserve judgment and say: well, there are sanctions in name and there are sanctions in deed, and it remains to be seen just how far this is going to go.Again, I just want to say that there is just a much bigger threat issue here, namely that if NATO winds up on the border of Russia, with Ukraine being fast-tracked into not just the EU but NATO with the plans now even to possibly deploy missile defense systems into Ukraine, that has been muted in the last 24 hours, we could be dealing with a much greater strategic crisis and conflict than one having to do with economic ties and sanctions and the war danger implicit in this, has been described by some people as a kind of reverse Cuban missile crisis that could bring us to the brink of the kind of the confrontation that I do not think anybody’s interests are served by pushing that button.- Geoffrey Steinberg, you seem to think that the bigger picture is about this, perhaps, military type of confrontation that may occur but, you know, maybe we do not have to go that far back; just a few days ago when Putin actually did issue a threat, this was against the US in that famous press conference that he had at his home outside of Moscow. He said, and this was in reference to the US, I think obviously now with the development of the EU coming and imposing sanctions; he said: If the US imposes sanctions on Russia, we may start using the Dollar for international transactions and an attempt to announce sanctions would end in a crash for the financial system of the United States, which would cause the end of the domination of the United States in the global financial system.Do you think that Putin would go through with that?- Well, I think that regardless of Russian actions, that the transatlantic financial system is on an extremely shaky ground, to begin with; and I do not think that Russia is the decisive or determinant factor in that.European banks are going through stress tests and probably about a third of the major European banks, the systemically significant banks, are going to be failing those tests. They are undercapitalized, the EU is under enormous pressure of the ECB to do a quantitative easing policy like the Fed.The Fed in the United States is now sitting on a portfolio of overvalued security assets in the range of two to three trillion dollars; that has never happened before. So I think that we are on a fragile ground to begin with.So I think that the economic problems are there regardless of whether we get into a kind of a pissing contest of back and forth sanctions with Russia threatening to step away from the Dollar role as a world reserve currency.Sergey Glazyev made statements in that general direction over the last few days as well. He is the head of the Customs Union; but I think that the weakness of Europe, as Peter (Sinnott) indicated, there was no impulse towards a Marshall Plan.Yanukovych, in the closing days of negotiations around the Eastern Partnership, said that Ukraine would need 14 billion Euros a year in investment for an undisclosed number of years to rebuild the economy up to a level to be competitive with European Union standards...Statement by Minister Nalbandian at the Informal Ministerial Meeting of EaP in Chisinau© 2005 - 2018 Panorama.am Բոլոր իրավունքները պաշտպանված են: Նյութերի օգտագործումն առանց հղման արգելվում է: Հրապարակման հեղինակի կարծիքը ոչ միշտ կարող է համընկնել խմբագրության կարծիքի հետ: Գովազդների բովանդակության պատասխանատվությունը գովազդատուներինն է:	Business

	 The euro sign is seen on the side of the building of EU headquarters in Brussels on Feb. 20, 2012.       Photo Credit: AP     If you looked out from Europe in the 1990s, you could see sunshine on the horizon. With the end of the Cold War, NATO appeared to be on the road to irrelevancy. But the sunshine has faded. Russia's dismemberment of Ukraine should remind Americans and Europeans that European security, for which all of us paid a high price over the past hundred years, is not assured.For Europe, the decade before 9/11 was hardly perfect. There were wars in the Balkans, and a civil war against Islamists in Algeria, across the Mediterranean. But Russia appeared to be democratizing. Turkey was moving toward Europe. The Israel-Palestinian peace process seemed to be working. Above all, Eastern Europe was secure and free.Today, few of those hopes remain. Russia is an authoritarian menace. Turkey is unsure of its regional role. Palestinians have never unambiguously accepted Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. The Arab Spring has toppled old autocrats, and replaced them with new ones, or with violent radicalism.All of that is bad. But worse, Americans and Europeans alike are operating on the strategy born in the sunny 1990s. We act as though Europe has solved its security problem, as though it has stable and increasingly friendly borders. It does not.NATO still exists, but a military alliance without a military is a contradiction in terms. European defense budgets have shrunk, reflecting the broader European public distaste for anything that reeks of hard power. Regrettably, most of the world feels differently.And since the United States no longer has a single Army brigade permanently deployed in Europe, our own commitment has melted away. This is not because of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia. It's because of the gradual U.S. acceptance after 1989 that most of Europe's problems had been solved, and the European Union could be trusted to handle what was left.The EU's approach was to employ soft power. North Africa would be slowly pushed toward reform by investment and diplomacy, Turkey would be strung along in negotiations about EU membership, and Ukraine would be pulled westward by support for civil society.Go inside New York politics.By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.But in most cases, the EU's approach didn't work. Turkey tired of the EU's road to nowhere. North Africa didn't reform; it revolted. Ukraine was pulled toward Europe, but the EU's soft power strategy has been crushed by Russia's hard power hammer.Russia's Vladimir Putin doesn't want to recreate the Soviet empire. He's learned the lesson of its fall: Don't occupy big places, like Poland, that hate your guts. His strategy is subtle: Use a Russian population, or create it by distributing passports, to manufacture grievances, then occupy a little chunk of territory and intimidate the rest. He still has vulnerable neighbors, including the Baltic republics.This week, the crisis is in Ukraine. But Crimea looks likely to join Kaliningrad, Belarus, Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, Georgia and Chechnya, all of which are either occupied in whole or in part by Russia, or are pseudo states recognized primarily by Russia and its cronies. These conflicts are frozen by Russian power, and too often ignored by the West, which encourages Putin to try again.So the first job for the United States and Europe is not responding to the Ukrainian crisis, per se. It is to recognize that our strategy for securing Europe from the troubled periphery is broken. These threats do not stem only from Putin, though he creates more than his fair share. Contrary to our hopes, Europe still has a security problem, one that cannot be met by the EU. As in the Cold War, it will take American leadership in NATO, and American recommitment to the security of Europe.Ted R.

597	"Returns as of 1/27/2018Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Returns as of 1/27/2018The situation in Ukraine and Crimea is ugly, complicated, and disturbing. It's moving to see the Ukrainian people fight for a more free and open society, even as Russia looks to be breaking international laws and muscling in on Crimea -- which has been part of Ukraine for more than 60 years. While I don't think it's fair for me -- or 99% of Americans -- to weigh in on what should happen, beyond letting the people of Crimea -- all of them, not just ethnic Russians -- have a voice in their destiny, the fact is, whatever happens will probably have far-reaching implications even here in America. One only has to look at two companies tied to the natural gas transportation business to see the potential for harm. Both Chart Industries (NASDAQ:GTLS) and Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) are set up to lose if Russia keeps down a path that leads to international sanctions. Images by Ivan Bandura via FlickrJust getting traction in a huge marketLast May, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev issued a decree to convert 50% of public transit and fleet vehicles in cities of more than 1 million people to natural gas by 2020. This amounts to potentially hundreds of thousands of natural-gas vehicles, including taxis, buses, and other support vehicles used in fleets. Not only does Russia hold some of the world's largest natural-gas reserves, it has very few natural gas refueling stations -- only around 200 or so -- in place to support new vehicles. Clean Energy Fuels announced a partnership with Russian Machines Corp just last month, naming the company as exclusive distributor and service provider of its IMW brand of compressors and compressor-filling systems in Russia. The two companies already work together in six other countries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. For Chart Industries, the company has just attained GOST R certification (a Russian government standard) for its LNG vehicle-fuel systems, meaning it would have access to this massive market as well. In addition to vehicle-fuel systems, Chart has plans to sell its permanent and mobile refueling stations as well as its L/CNG refueling systems in Russia in the near future. Sanctions coming?Unidentified gunmen on patrol at Simferopol Airport in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, Feb. 28, 2014 Source: Voice of AmericaThe risk, of course, is potential economic sanctions. If the situation around Crimea and Ukraine continues, economic sanctions would likely exclude or limit American businesses from doing business in Russia. The anti-U.S. backlash from Russians, if indeed sanctions of any kind to occur, could very well limit business dealings -- no matter what the eventual outcome is. The thing is, Russia has Europe over a barrel -- or more accurately, over a natural-gas pipeline, so it's really hard to say what, exactly, will happen. But the risk is very real. What's the opportunity?One only has to look at Chart's strong business growth in China in recent years to see the potential for the Russian market. In 2013, Chart signed one deal with PetroChina alone that was worth $50 million and announced an $80 million expansion of its manufacturing facility in the country that will double production capacity when complete. The Asian market is simply massive; Chart's Distribution and Storage business grew 66% in Asia last year. Russia should be a significant part of Chart's growth in Asia for years to come. President Barack Obama speaking with Vladimir Putin. Source; White HouseFor Clean Energy Fuels, CEO Andrew Littlefair wouldn't project any numbers for the deal with Russian Machines. But the IMW deal in 2013 with China Gas should give some indication: That deal called for as many as 416 compressors at 310 stations and could amount to $150 million in revenue over three years. Considering Clean Energy did around $350 million in total sales in 2013, $50 million per year is a significant amount of upside. The deal with Russian Machines could offer similar potential. The possibility of sanctions alters that potential in a real way. Final thoughts: Human lives are at stake and this matters more right nowLet me be clear about one thing: The loss of any upside for these companies pales in comparison to the potential for armed conflict and loss of lives should this situation escalate. But investors should at least keep an eye on this and be aware that there could be impacts -- if not to the near-term potential -- to the opportunity for these companies to expand into the Russian market. While it will have limited impact in 2014 no matter what happens, it's a reminder how conflicts a world away can impact us in ways we don't expect. Jason Hall owns shares of Clean Energy Fuels.

598	Reuters Staff1 Min ReadON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE, March 7 (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to downplay the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter. Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for Russian natural gas.     (Writing by Jeff Mason; Editing by Sandra Maler)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

600	"By Michael ShieldsVIENNA (Reuters) - The Council of Europe, the pan-European human rights watchdog, is offering to investigate violence and the treatment of minorities in Ukraine to try to defuse mounting tensions between Kiev and Russia, Austria said.Sebastian Kurz, the foreign minister of Austria, which holds the revolving chair of the 47-member Council until May, told Reuters on Friday that he and the Council's secretary general would visit Kiev on Monday to offer its services in the conflict.Moscow has cited the need to protect the rights of the ethnic Russian minority in Ukraine as the official reason for its military intervention that has put pro-Russia forces in control of the Crimea region, where ethnic Russians are in the majority.President Vladimir Putin underscored that on Friday, rebuffing a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over Moscow's intervention and saying that Russia could not ignore calls for help from Russian speakers in Ukraine.""We know the ethnic Russians in Crimea are anything but a minority but nevertheless for peaceful co-existence in Crimea it is decisive how people treat each other in Ukraine, how human rights are respected and how minorities are protected and supported,"" Kurz said.Both Russia and Ukraine are members of the Council of Europe, which Kurz said had credibility and expertise in supporting minority rights. He called the Ukrainian parliament's repeal of a law making Russia a recognized language in some regions ""an absolute mistake"".The Council of Europe is best known for drawing up the European Convention on Human Rights, which entered into force in 1953 and established the European Court of Human Rights.Asked how Russia had reacted so far to the mediation offer, Kurz said: ""At least there have been no negative voices in the Council of Europe from the Russian side.""The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is also trying to mediate in Ukraine.However, dozens of military observers from OSCE members invited by Ukraine to monitor the situation in Crimea had to turn back on Thursday after failing to get past roadblocks.The OSCE, a pan-European forum for security issues that was set up during the Cold War, is also trying to put together a ""contact group"" of leading players in the Ukraine crisis and to arrange a broader monitoring mission for Ukraine.OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities Astrid Thors expressed alarm on Thursday about the situation in Crimea, citing ""a real risk of bloodshed"".During her visit to Kiev and Crimea, she ""found no evidence of violations or threats to the rights of Russian speakers"", her office said in a statement.(Editing by Susan Fenton)"	Business
601	Main content starts below.Sign in to follow this authorIn February, the winter Olympic Games brought athletes from around the world together in Russia, but in Ukraine, Russia’s neighbor to the southwest, the story has been one of division. Violent clashes between pro-EU (European Union) protesters and government forces in the past few months have focused the eyes of the world on the former-Soviet state after (now former) President Yanukovych had refused to sign an Association Pact forging closer ties to the EU and decided instead to accept funding from Russia.These incidents are extremely tragic, and we sympathize with the people there during this time of chaos. We are watching developments closely as they unfold, including the most recent tensions in the Crimean peninsula. While it’s impossible to determine how the situation will play out, as an investor, I believe Ukraine’s strategic importance to both Russia and the EU could help ensure its survival, its solvency—and its potential long-term success.Ukraine today is clearly at a crossroads, and its market has been volatile. We expect ongoing noise and political tensions will continue there for a while. Central power in Ukraine is in disarray while, in many regions, local governors have either resigned or have effectively stopped managing their territories due to uncertainty in the capital city of Kiev. Ukraine’s parliament (Rada) has wasted no time proposing new legislative reforms, including one to limit presidential powers. Speaker Alexander Turchinov is serving as acting president until elections are held in late May.While the opposition has taken control, the country is fairly divided between east and west and between views of whether it should move closer to the EU or closer to Russia. That divided view among the Ukrainians is expressed in the political rhetoric and, unfortunately for the people there, I don’t think there’s going to be a quick solution. You can see the political dividing lines in Ukraine drawn in its electoral map; the parts of the country oriented farther westward, toward Europe, have been the areas where the most fervent protests have taken place. Closer to the Russian border on the east, you’ll find more Russian-speaking Ukrainians, and more support for the more pro-Russian policies of former President Yanukovych.As long-term investors, my team and I continue to be interested in Ukrainian equities where we see opportunities on an individual company level. Looking past the headlines, it’s important to remember that Ukraine offers Russia access to its only naval seaport on the Black Sea, it has gas pipeline access to Europe, and it is considered Europe’s breadbasket. Ukraine is geopolitically one of the most important countries in Eurasia, and, assuming the country doesn’t break apart, I think it will need to use diplomatic skills to maintain friendly relations with Russia while also opening to the West. Another Soviet-bloc country and neighbor to Russia, Georgia, represents an example in this regard. Russia still holds influence there, but Georgia is forging its own path, as I wrote about in a post in December.While global escalation of the current conflict remains a possibility in Ukraine, we think this is unlikely as it is in the interest of all parties to have a unified and stable Ukraine. There are four sources from which financial support for Ukraine could come: the EU, the US, Russia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Amid an escalation of conflict, Russia has suspended its financial aid package, which had been keeping Ukraine solvent. The EU might come through with some aid, but it will probably not be close to what Ukraine needs. Also, European aid could come with considerable delays due to procedures in the EU.The United States could also offer aid, but probably not the entire US$15 billion-plus sought by the Ukrainians. It seems to me that the IMF would be the only realistic option. We cannot rule out a possibility that the IMF could soften its conditions for release of a new tranche of aid now, particularly when (as we suspect) the EU and the United States have asked, or will ask, it to. This option could also suit Russia. Ukraine has to repay about US$8 billion on its debt this year, and the next large payment is scheduled for June. The Rada’s decision to call new presidential elections on May 25 could also have been influenced by this timeline.The situation in Ukraine remains confused, but it seems that Russia on the one side and the U.S. and the EU on the other, do not want a military confrontation. As we see it, Russia certainly does not want an unstable government in Ukraine and the EU certainly does not want it in view of the enormous amounts of gas that are pumped to Europe from Russia to Ukraine. For these reasons, it is no surprise that Russia has moved back from an armed conflict by having the Russian troops on the eastern Ukraine border retreat back to base.President Putin also held out the possibility of recognizing the winner of the May presidential elections as well as participating in a multilateral program for the country. Factors tempering Russia’s behavior in Ukraine have been the big decline in the ruble and the Russian stock market since the conflict began to escalate, a confirmation that Russia is subject to international pressures. Russia needs to attract foreign capital and the Ukraine situation will likely impact flows, so their actions will likely need to be measured, in our view. The important point is that Russia now has de facto control of Crimea and has stated that it would intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine if asked by the local Russian-speaking population.Overall, because of the intense interest from Russia and the West, we think Ukraine will not likely be short of finances from either or both sides, if the new leadership is able to act wisely and diplomatically.We will be watching developments in Ukraine closely, and are hopeful for a peaceful resolution. We are also hopeful that we’ll see a quite different Ukraine story in a few years—and that it will be a much more positive one.Photo: DIMITAR DILKOFF / Getty ImagesDr. Mobius’ comments, opinions and analyses are for informational purposes only and should not be considered individual investment advice or a recommendation to invest in any security or to adopt any investment strategy.

605	IT’S the breakfast staple loved all over the world, and now the banana industry is due for the biggest shake-up its ever seen. Check out what’s happening.The merger is still subject to approvals and should be completed by the end of the year.Source:SuppliedCHIQUITA Brands International, the US fresh food giant, and Ireland's Fyffes say they will merge to create the world's biggest banana company.The transaction will create a combined company valued at $US1.07 billion ($A1.19 billion) named ChiquitaFyffes, a fresh produce company with annual revenue of $US4.6 billion, the companies said in a joint statement.The all-stock deal values the Irish company at $US526 million. The combined company will become the leading global banana and other fresh produce company, with sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas a year, they said.The deal puts together two storied banana companies that began in the 19th century as modest suppliers and grew into global powerhouses.Chiquita was founded by Captain Lorenzo Dow Baker, who in 1870 bought bunches of bananas in Jamaica and sold them for a profit in New Jersey.The transaction is a “milestone” for the food which is popular all over the world.Source:News LimitedFyffes, founded in 1888 as EW Fyffe, Son and Co, launched the first fruit brand in the world in 1929 with its “Fyffes Blue Label” sticker on bananas.“This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies,” said Ed Lonergan, Chiquita&apos;s chief executive.Chiquita is a leading global marketer and distributor of fresh food products, including bananas and packaged salads. Fyffes is one of Europe&apos;s largest tropical produce distributors, mainly bananas, pineapples and melons.Chiquita shareholders will own approximately 50.7 per cent of the new company, with Fyffes shareholders owning the rest. The value of the transaction was based on the companies&apos; closing share prices on Friday and an exchange rate of one euro to $US1.39. ChiquitaFyffes will have an operating presence in more than 70 countries and a workforce of some 32,000 people.Lonergan will serve as chairman of ChiquitaFyffes and David McCann, Fyffes executive chairman, will be chief executive.“We are looking forward to working with the Chiquita team to build a combined company which is well positioned to succeed in our highly competitive marketplace and which will create significant value for our shareholders,” McCann said.The merger is still subject to approvals and should be completed by the end of the year.Source:SuppliedThe merger is subject to shareholder and regulator approvals. The companies expect it to close by the end of the year.Chiquita and Fyffes predicted the tie-up of their complementary business would produce operational efficiencies and pre-tax cost savings of at least $US40 million a year by the end of 2016. The combined company will have more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America.They pledged to continue their commitment to sustainability and pro-environment concerns.“ChiquitaFyffes will continue its environmental and social responsibility commitments, including adding additional organic, Fairtrade, GlobalGAP and Rainforest Alliance certified capacity,” they said.The merged company will maintain the brands of each company. Generations of Americans know Chiquita brand bananas, brought to life in 1944 by the glamorous Miss Chiquita animated banana and portrayed live by models and personalities.Fyffes has extended its groundbreaking oval Blue Label banana brand to Blue Label Pineapples and winter season melons.The combined company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and based in Ireland.Chiquita, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, posted a loss of $US16 million for 2013, a sharp improvement after losing $US405 million in 2012.On Monday, Fyffes announced preliminary results for 2013 showing a profit of $US26.1 million euros ($A28.96 million), up almost 10 per cent from the prior year.Chiquita shares jumped 12.1 per cent to $US12.15 in late-morning trade in New York. Fyffes soared 42 per cent to 106.50 pence in London.A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

607	On the face of it, Chiquita’s proposed merger with fellow banana giant, Fyffes, makes sense a lot of sense. Since he took over as Chiquita’s CEO in October 2012, Ed Longergan has aggressively reversed the company’s money-losing diversification strategy, vowing instead to concentrate on bananas and salads. The merger seems to help with that; some 71% of the new company’s sales will come from bananas, compared with 65% of Chiquita’s.But look at it another way, and you see the deal boosting its “other produce category” from the current 4% to 9%—a funny move for a company dead-set on un-diversifying. Assuming the new company passes antitrust muster, a lot of ChiquitaFyffes’ new non-banana business will come from melons and pineapples, in which Fyffes has been investing pretty heavily (pdf, p.19).Why would Chiquita be reversing course, abandoning the diversification strategy that saw it shed grape and avocado production?For one thing, both melons and pineapples are proving promising for Fyffes. The company’s melon business focuses on the US, where sales have more than doubled since 2008, and it became the top melon-seller in 2011. As for pineapples, while its sales trail those of Fresh Del Monte and Dole in both Europe and the US, Fyffes’ share has been steadily increasing. Neither division would be easily sold off. Fyffes has invested heavily in expanding cultivation of both types of fruit in Latin America; its now grows all of its melons and 56% of its pineapples there.But another reason might be the rising risk that banana diseases pose to the industry. We recently discussed how an invincible fungus called Panama disease will inevitably threaten banana plantations in Latin America, where the vast majority of export bananas are grown. A more immediate menace is Black Sigatoka, a disease that typically causes losses of 50%-80% of any crop it strikes and is already a severe problem in a slew of Latin American countries. That disease and others force growers to use more pesticides, causing a sharp spike in costs. The growing torrents of chemicals that farmers have to pour on their banana crops is also upping concerns about environmental destruction and harm to workers.One other thing to note is that Chiquita is not in great financial shape; as of Aug. 2013, its $602 million in total debt was the second-highest relative to earnings among 32 similar packaged-food and meat companies in the US, reports Bloomberg. Which is why it’s interesting that, despite the fact that Chiquita is much bigger than Fyffes, the new company will be based in Ireland, Fyffes’ home country, rather than Chiquita’s home, the US. As Quartz’s Tim Fernholz recently noted, Ireland has an incredibly low corporate tax rate. And for Chiquita, a company struggling to up its cash flow, that certainly can’t hurt.	Business

609	Produce giant Chiquita Brands International said Monday that it will buy Irish rival Fyffes in an all-stock deal valued at $526 million, making the Charlotte-based company the world’s largest banana supplier. The merger is sure to raise a stink in an industry dominated by a small bunch of suppliers. Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole Food and Fresh Del Monte control more than 80 percent of the world’s banana trade, according to the United Nations. Chiquita estimates that the acquisition will result in annual revenue of $4.6 billion and produce operational savings of about $40 million by the end of 2016. The deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2014, has been approved by both boards. It is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.The combined company will be known as ChiquitaFyffes, with 50.7 percent of the firm owned by Chiquita shareholders and the remaining 49.3 percent held by Fyffes shareholders. ChiquitaFyffes, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will be incorporated in Ireland and have an estimated value of $1.07 billion, according to the company.“This is a natural strategic partnership,” Ed Lonergan, Chiquita’s chief executive, said in a statement. “The combined company will also be able to provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.” Lonergan will become chairman of the new company, while Fyffes’s executive chairman, David McCann, will become chief executive. ChiquitaFyffes will have a combined workforce of 32,000 employees in nearly 70 countries. It also will have a strong position in pineapples, melons and packaged salads, according to the company. “This deal will be transformative and offer exciting opportunities for the new business,” McCann said in a statement. It is a difficult time to be in the banana business.Exports of the fruit rose by 7.3 percent in 2012 to an all-time high of 16.5 million tons, according to the most recent data from the U.N. Innovations. Refrigeration of bananas in transport has extended their shelf life and bolstered demand.Yet pricing pressures from supermarkets are hurting producer profits, while growers battle higher production costs in the face of rising levels of disease, analysts say. “Two big fruit companies have felt the downward pressure of the big retail buyers on their margins, and consolidation appears to them to be a strategy for survival,” said Alistair Smith, international coordinator for Banana Link, a British nonprofit group fighting for fair banana trade. “Small farmers are under pressure from all sides, and big mergers like this can only make them more nervous about the future of their livelihoods.”An unexpected oversupply of bananas in Guatemala and Ecuador created a soft market for Chiquita in the last three months of 2013, according to the company. It lost $31 million during the fourth quarter, down from a $333 million loss for the same period a year earlier. Chiquita also was rocked by a persistent drought in the West that led to a shortage of iceberg lettuce and other ingredients needed for its Fresh Express-brand bagged salads. The merger will unite two of the world’s oldest fruit distributors. Chiquita began in 1870, when Capt. Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica and sailed them to Jersey City. The company made a name for itself in 1944 by introducing the world to “Miss Chiquita,” a cartoon banana that extolled the virtues of eating the fruit.Not all of Chiquita’s history is as bright. The company, under the name United Fruit, forced regime change throughout the Caribbean and Central America during the 1950s and ’60s to protect its interests.Chiquita filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001, crippled by trade restrictions imposed by the European Union. That year, it paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $100,000 to resolve allegations that employees concealed a bribe paid to Colombian officials for a customs license.Payoffs in Colombia got Chiquita in trouble again in 2007, when the company handed the Justice Department $25 million for paying paramilitary groups $1.7 million for protection in the northern Uraba region. U.S. officials got involved because the groups were on the State Department’s terrorist watch list. Dublin-based Fyffes has been distributing bananas since founder Edward Wathen Fyffe shipped his first bunch in 1888 from the Canary Islands to London. The McCann family has run the company since the 1950s.Shares of Fyffes rose more than 40 percent on news of the merger, while Chiquita’s shares surged more than 10 percent. 	Business

ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66).Fyffes rose 46 percent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York.Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.David McCann, Fyffes' chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.Lonergan said their ""natural strategic partnership"" would ""provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.""However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there.

                                          agreed to merge, creating the world’s largest banana company, ChiquitaFyffes. In a $1.07 billion all-stock deal, the combined company would have an estimated $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas.  Also see: How to make Ireland a banana republic The merger should help the companies more efficiently supply the planet’s biggest banana republic: namely, the U.S. “The No. 1 fruit Americans eat is bananas,” says Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst with NPD Group. Indeed, while in 1970, Americans ate just about seven pounds of bananas per person (and more than 10 pounds of apples, which were at that time our favorite fruit), by 2010, they were eating more than 10 pounds of bananas per person, and only around 9.5 pounds of apples, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Global consumers love bananas too. According to the United Nations, global banana exports in 2012 climbed more than 7% from 2011 to a record high of 16.5 million tons; the U.S. and Europe accounted for more than half of banana imports.The Chiquita-Fyffes merger will generate an annual cost savings of $40 million by 2016, according to the companies. And that savings might mean slightly lower prices for consumers, says IBISWorld analyst Antal Neville, who says that ChiquitaFyffes may want to gain market share by offering up the best banana prices for consumers. Currently, bananas cost roughly $0.60 per pound — significantly less on a per-pound basis than apples, oranges, grapefruits, tomatoes and more, according to government data. “Because it’s one of the most consumed fruits, prices really matter,” says Neville. “So the merger could mean cost savings for consumers.” Indeed, grocers are often reluctant to pass along price increases. According to a United Nations report, wholesale banana prices increased 6.5% in 2012 compared with 2011, while retail prices actually decreased 1.3%. “This apparent contradiction could be explained by the fact that supermarkets spread temporary losses from higher wholesale prices across other products that they sell,” while keeping the prices of bananas low for their customers, the report concludes.Still, if the deadly banana plague that has hit Asia and parts of Australia hits Latin America and the Caribbean, which produce roughly three-fourths of the world’s bananas, prices could jump, says Neville. The disease, which scientists say is caused by a soil fungus, attacks the popular Cavendish variety of bananas (which makes up about 80% of all banana exports) and rots the banana plants, turning the normally yellowish banana a rancid-smelling brownish color, and rendering the fruit inedible. The disease is especially troubling because it ruins large numbers of bananas (a variant of today’s fungus virtually killed off the Gros Michel banana variety) and recently made the jump from Asia to Mozambique and Jordan. Experts say that if the banana plague takes a particularly heavy toll, consumers may feel the impact on their wallets — and not just from the price of buying a banana at the grocery store. Neville says that if prices climb high enough, some businesses will choose to raise prices on things like smoothies and muffins that contain bananas. Still, he adds, a much more likely scenario is that — unless prices skyrocket — companies will eat a potential uptick in banana prices. Indeed, businesses know how much we love bananas, and they don’t want to risk alienating consumers by hiking the price unless they have to.

617	"Chiquita will merge with Irish fruit distributor Fyffes in a deal worth about $1.7 billion, the two companies announced Monday. The merger, if approved, will create the world's largest banana supplier. Chiquita may be the biggest name in the banana market, but surprisingly, it isn’t the top supplier of the fruit. Or, at least, it wasn’t until today.Chiquita Brands International has agreed to buy Fyffes Plc, a Dublin-based fruit distributor, for about $565 million, according to a Chiquita and Fyffes joint company statement released Monday. The merger will bring together two of the world’s oldest fruit importers.Pending approval, the deal will be a boon for investors as well: Fyffes shareholders will get 0.1567 shares of the new company for every one share they own of Fyffles, and Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each Chiquita share. Shares of both companies surged: Fyffes rose 44 percent in Dublin trading, while shares for Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita jumped 14 percent in the morning before leveling off later Monday. It closed up 10.7 percent at $12 a share. The new company will be called ChiquitaFyffes and be worth an estimated $1.7 billion. It will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but operations will be based in Ireland. Chiquita shareholders will own 50.7 percent of the new company, with Fyffes shareholders owning the remaining 49.3 percent.""This deal will be transformative and offer exciting opportunities for the new business. We are looking forward to working with the Chiquita team to build a combined company which is well positioned to succeed in our highly competitive marketplace and which will create significant value for our shareholders,"" Fyffes Executive Chairman David Cann said in the companies’ joint press statement. “We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.""Chiquita employs approximately 20,000 workers; Fyffes has about 12,000 workers.According to the two companies, the merger will create a company grossing $4.6 billion in annual revenue. The merger should be completed by the end of 2014. The deal puts ChiquitaFyffes well ahead of Dole and Del Monte, its chief competitors in the banana distribution market. The new company moves a combined 180 million boxes of bananas per year, while Del Monte and Dole sell 117 million and 110 million, respectively.Chiquita and Fyffes are both very well-known brands, albeit to different groups of people. Chiquita, formerly known as the United Fruit  Company, was founded in 1863 and is the chief banana distributor for the United States. It has a checkered history, fraught with accusations of human rights violations and bribery scandals. In 2010, the company reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the US federal government over allegations that it had  financial ties to Colombian paramilitary groups. Fyffes also began in the 1870s, as a group of banana plantations in the Virgin Islands, and is one of the largest tropical fruit importers in Europe. The company was linked to an insider trading scandal in 2008.

When four plan to become three, alarm bells should sound at the competition authorities. The plan by Chiquita and Fyffes to become top bananas in their world, creating distance from global rivals Dole and Del Monte, is no exception.A combined ChiquitaFyffes might control only about 15% of the global banana market but that could still be enough to change the structure of the market. True, Chiquita serves mostly the US market, whereas Irish-based Fyffes concentrates on Europe, but there is some crossover that can't be ignored. Nor, too, can the impact on smaller producers' attempts to find a viable foothold in a tough market where the pressures at the growers' end of the chain are notoriously intense.ChiquitaFyffes' best argument is that nobody in the banana-distribution game is making fat profit margins and that supermarkets everywhere are quite capable of protecting consumers' interests. It's not an unreasonable argument – but it should be tested.As for the deal itself, the financial logic is obvious. Chiquita and Fyffes say they could save $40m a year from ""efficiencies in the areas of logistics and procurement"". That's a chunky sum in the context of current aggregate top-line earnings of $175m – thus the strong share price reaction, particularly at Fyffes, whose owners would get 49.3% of the combo. The bigger question, though, is whether there's also something in this deal for consumers and banana-growers. The merger will probably happen but let's see it examined properly."	Business

The company currently employs about 300 people at its headquarters in uptown.          Listen  Listening...              / 1:03     Chiquita is merging with a company called Fyffes to create the world's largest banana supplier. Fyffes is based in Dublin, and that's technically where the combined company will be headquartered.David Holohan is head of research at Merrion Stockbrokers in Ireland.""The decision to have the headquarters in Dublin is really just aligned to facilitate the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, which will come from Fyffes, and they're currently based in Dublin at the moment,"" he said.Holohan said it also doesn't hurt that Ireland charges about a third of what the U.S. does in corporate income taxes.But a Chiquita spokesman said the company will still have a major footprint in Charlotte. For one, some executives will still be here, like current CEO Ed Lonergan, who'll become chairman.Also, the company is still on track to employ about 400 people in Charlotte. It'll need to do that in order to cash in the big incentives deal the state and city promised when Chiquita moved here in 2012.The Chiquita spokesman and Charlotte's mayor say the merger doesn't appear to impact those incentives, which could add up to more than $20 million. View the discussion thread.Chiquita will hold its annual shareholders meeting in Charlotte for the first time Thursday.  It's a sign the company's relocation from Cincinnati is complete – and it's an opportunity to take a look at what Charlotte taxpayers got for the generous tax incentives they gave Chiquita.

621	"American fruit firm Chiquita and Irish fruit distributor Fyffes have agreed to merge, creating the world's largest banana company.This article is from the archive of our partner .American fruit firm Chiquita and Irish fruit distributor Fyffes have agreed to merge, creating the world's largest banana company. The all-stock deal, valued at $1.07 billion, will create a new company ChiquitaFyffes that will soon control about a third percent of the world's export banana market. Chiquita pretty much dominates North American while Fyffes rules in Europe. Here are some major takeaways from the deal that makes ChiquitaFyffes the world's top, uh ... banana.Four companies — Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole and Del Monto — control more than 80 percent of the world's banana sales, according to the UN. Once this merger deal goes through, that number will decrease by one.This concentration is noticeable not just in the business ranks, but in the actual species of bananas grown. The banana industry largely relies on one single species called the Cavendish, the long yellow offering you know well from trips to the grocery store. While other fruits are diversified — apples, for example, come in granny smith, red delicious, fuji, and many more — the banana industry's reliance on one type leaves the industry vulnerable to certain shocks... like a banana-killing fungus moving to Latin America, where most of the world's banana exports are grown. ""Panama Disease"" has hurt Asian exports the past few years and is just now spreading to the top banana of Latin American exports. It's a risk for not just the corporation, but also their competitors.Though the U.S.-based Chiquita is much larger than its merge partner Fyffes, the new ChiquitaFyffes will be based in Fyffes' home of Ireland. The reason, Quartz theorizes, is likely because of Ireland's lower corporate tax rates. That should be good for Chiquita, which has significant debt problems. The company will also save about $40 million annually by 2016 thanks to more efficient purchasing, according to Bloomberg.Dole and Del Monte likely won't sit idly by now that their market share has been eclipsed. ""Now a firm number one has been created, there will be some impetus for further consolidation in the sector,"" David Holohan, an analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers, told Reuters. Dole is in charge of 26 percent of export market share and Del Monte holds 15 percent, The Wall Street Journal notes. Merging with a smaller company (or each other?) could keep those two competing on an equal plane with ChiquitaFyffes.This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.
    Almost everything about the naked mole rat is bizarre.
A high-carb diet, and the attendant high blood sugar, are associated with cognitive decline.In recent years, Alzheimer’s disease has occasionally been referred to as “type 3” diabetes, though that moniker doesn’t make much sense. After all, though they share a problem with insulin, type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, and type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease caused by diet. Instead of another type of diabetes, it’s increasingly looking like Alzheimer’s is another potential side effect of a sugary, Western-style diet.In some cases, the path from sugar to Alzheimer’s leads through type 2 diabetes, but as a new study and others show, that’s not always the case.A longitudinal study, published Thursday in the journal Diabetologia, followed 5,189 people over 10 years and found that people with high blood sugar had a faster rate of cognitive decline than those with normal blood sugar—whether or not their blood-sugar level technically made them diabetic. In other words, the higher the blood sugar, the faster the cognitive decline.A British broadcaster doggedly tried to put words into the academic’s mouth.My first introduction to Jordan B. Peterson, a University of Toronto clinical psychologist, came by way of an interview that began trending on social media last week. Peterson was pressed by the British journalist Cathy Newman to explain several of his controversial views. But what struck me, far more than any position he took, was the method his interviewer employed. It was the most prominent, striking example I’ve seen yet of an unfortunate trend in modern communication.First, a person says something. Then, another person restates what they purportedly said so as to make it seem as if their view is as offensive, hostile, or absurd.Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and various Fox News hosts all feature and reward this rhetorical technique. And the Peterson interview has so many moments of this kind that each successive example calls attention to itself until the attentive viewer can’t help but wonder what drives the interviewer to keep inflating the nature of Peterson’s claims, instead of addressing what he actually said.... and the movies and TV shows we watchPamela Paul’s memories of reading are less about words and more about the experience. “I almost always remember where I was and I remember the book itself. I remember the physical object,” says Paul, the editor of The New York Times Book Review, who reads, it is fair to say, a lot of books. “I remember the edition; I remember the cover; I usually remember where I bought it, or who gave it to me. What I don’t remember—and it’s terrible—is everything else.”For example, Paul told me she recently finished reading Walter Isaacson’s biography of Benjamin Franklin. “While I read that book, I knew not everything there was to know about Ben Franklin, but much of it, and I knew the general timeline of the American revolution,” she says. “Right now, two days later, I probably could not give you the timeline of the American revolution.”A film clip brings back the lost language of pre-World War II AmericaThe Atlantic's wonderful new Video Channel has a lot of great material, and it is invidious to point to any one offering rather than another. But this clip, ""Wings Over the Golden Gate,"" which I started watching because of the irresistible aviation + California combo (I have flown over exactly the scenes shown here) got my attention for another reason. Watch for about 60 seconds and you'll see what I mean.The language that the narrator, one Gayne Whitman, uses is florid enough. But his accent! It's instantly familiar to anyone who's seen old movies and newsreels from the 1930s and 1940s. But you cannot imagine a present-day American using it with a straight face. It's not faux-British, but it's a particular kind of lah-dee-dah American diction that at one time was very familiar and now has vanished. Margaret Dumont, in the Marx Brothers movies, was maybe the most familiar and caricatured female equivalent. Even Katharine Hepburn's very arch accent (eg in Philadelphia Story) seemed a step closer to ""modern"" American usage. Whatever Mark Zuckerberg says about human community or his legacy, his company is acting in its own interests—and against the public good.Facebook’s crushing blow to independent media arrived last fall in Slovakia, Cambodia, Guatemala, and three other nations.The social giant removed stories by these publishers from users’ news feeds, hiding them in a new, hard-to-find stream. These independent publishers reported that they lost as much as 80 percent of their audience during this experiment.Facebook doesn’t care. At least, it usually seems that way.Despite angry pushback in the six countries affected by Facebook’s algorithmic tinkering, the company is now going ahead with similar changes to its news feed globally. These changes will likely de-prioritize stories from professional publishers, and instead favor dispatches published by a user’s friends and family. Many American news organizations will see the sharp traffic declines their brethren in other nations experienced last year—unless they pay Facebook to include their stories in readers’ feeds.What one Vietnam War battle, celebrated by the press and the military as a turning point towards an inevitable American victory, says about certainty and authoritativeness.I had a brother at Khe SanhFighting off the Viet CongThey're still there, he's all gone
––Bruce Springsteen, Born in the USA, 1984The Battle of Khe Sanh began 50 years ago this week when roughly 20,000 North Vietnamese troops surrounded an isolated combat base held by roughly 5,500 Marines. The marines could not be reinforced or resupplied except by air, and the enemy had attacked during monsoon season, when the weather would limit flights. General William Westmoreland, commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, ordered them to fight to hold the base rather than evacuate.The North Vietnamese hoped to repeat the sort of victory won years earlier at Dien Bien Phu, when similarly besieged French forces were overrun and slaughtered.Humanity has 30 years to find out.All parents remember the moment when they first held their children—the tiny crumpled face, an entire new person, emerging from the hospital blanket. I extended my hands and took my daughter in my arms. I was so overwhelmed that I could hardly think.Afterward I wandered outside so that mother and child could rest. It was three in the morning, late February in New England. There was ice on the sidewalk and a cold drizzle in the air. As I stepped from the curb, a thought popped into my head: When my daughter is my age, almost 10 billion people will be walking the Earth. I stopped midstride. I thought, How is that going to work?To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. The president’s pattern of behavior may be enough to surmount the high legal threshold for proving that he sought to stifle the special counsel’s investigation.President Trump’s own actions, as reported on Thursday night, have strengthened the case for obstruction of justice against him, despite the significant legal obstacles to pursuing such a case against a sitting president.Trump ordered his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential obstruction of justice by the president, The New York Times reported. Trump relented only when McGahn threatened to resign, an echo of the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre, in which President Nixon’s top Justice Department officials resigned rather than carry out his order to fire the special counsel investigating the Watergate break-in.How Afghanistan’s neighbor cultivated American dependency while subverting American policyTwo months after the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Vice President–elect Joe Biden sat with Afghanistan’s president, Hamid Karzai, in the Arg Palace, an 83-acre compound in Kabul that had become a gilded cage for the mercurial and isolated leader. The discussion was already tense as Karzai urged Washington to help root out Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan, implying that more pressure needed to be exerted on Pakistani leaders. Biden’s answer stunned Karzai into silence. Biden let Karzai know how Barack Obama’s incoming administration saw its priorities. “Mr. President,” Biden said, “Pakistan is fifty times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.”It was an undiplomatic moment for sure, but also a frank expression of the devastating paradox at the heart of the longest war in American history. In 16 years, the United States has spent billions of dollars fighting a war that has killed thousands of soldiers and an untold number of civilians in a country that Washington considers insignificant to its strategic interests in the region. Meanwhile, the country it has viewed as a linchpin, Pakistan—a nuclear-armed cauldron of volatile politics and long America’s closest military ally in South Asia—has pursued a covert campaign in Afghanistan designed to ensure that the money and the lives have been spent in vain. The stakes in Pakistan have been considered too high to break ties with Islamabad or take other steps that would risk destabilizing the country. The stakes in Afghanistan have been deemed low enough that careening from one failed strategy to another has been acceptable.The most out-there political players, like Sheriff Joe Arpaio, typically aren’t the ones considered to be the future of their parties.With Joe Arpaio’s announcement that he is running for Senate, Arizona is poised to have its Alabama Moment. The national media will descend, and the spotlight will focus on the state. The rest of the country will line up to pass judgment on every word, cough, and bit of froth to escape Sheriff Joe’s lips. Countless chat-show segments will be devoted to Arizonans’ thoughts on race, immigration, and the appropriateness of a recently pardoned felon running for high office.Win or lose, Arpaio stands to suck a crazy amount of the oxygen out of his contest—just as Roy Moore and Donald Trump did in their respective elections. That’s because, in today’s politics, outrageousness is the name of the game.What remains of a boy’s absentee father is a discarded paternity test and 100 texts archived in a Nokia phone.One very eccentric man claims to be Russia’s guardian angel of cheese.For rising models in one of the largest favelas of Rio de Janeiro, fashion is an opportunity for self-actualization.Support 160 years of independent journalism.

624	"Chiquita Brands International Inc., owner of the namesake banana label, agreed to buy Ireland’s Fyffes Plc to create the world’s biggest supplier of the fruit for about 407 million euros ($565 million).The combined company will be called ChiquitaFyffes Plc, Chiquita and Fyffes said today in a joint statement. The all- stock offer represents a bid premium of 35 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Shares of Chiquita and Fyffes rose.The deal brings together two of the world’s oldest fruit importers, who between them have operations spanning the Americas, Europe and Asia. Chiquita Chief Executive Officer Ed Lonergan, who will become chairman of ChiquitaFyffes, has sought to reshape his Charlotte, North Carolina-based company as a high-volume seller of bananas and salads while winding down and abandoning other product lines.“The deal is logical and will be a good fit going forward for both parties,” said David Holohan, an analyst at Merrion Capital in Dublin. “This is an excellent result for Fyffes.”Investors will get 0.1567 of a share in ChiquitaFyffes for each Fyffes share, while Chiquita holders will receive one share in the new company for each one of the existing company.Fyffes Chairman David McCann will become CEO of the combined company, which will be domiciled in Ireland, trade in New York and have annual sales of about $4.6 billion. The transaction is expected to close this year, pending approval by shareholders and the Irish High Court.Minimal OverlapChiquita investors will own about 50.7 percent of the combined entity, with Fyffes shareholders holding the remainder. As well as bananas, ChiquitaFyffes will supply melons, pineapples and packaged salads. The new business will target at least $40 million of annual cost savings by the end of 2016 through more efficient purchasing.Fyffes shares rose 45 percent to 1.29 euros at 3:21 p.m. in Dublin. Chiquita climbed 12 percent to $12.15 in New York.Lonergan, who will become chairman of ChiquitaFyffes, said today on a conference call that he doesn’t think there will be any regulatory issues arising from the deal that can’t be addressed.He also said there’s minimal overlap of both companies geographically. Chiquita operates in 70 countries including the U.S., with brands such as Chiquita Bananas and Fresh Express. Fyffes operates in Europe, Central and South America, and Asia.Conference MeetingChiquita started more than 140 years ago when Captain Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica, sailed to Jersey City in 11 days and sold them for a profit. The company is still incorporated in New Jersey, according to corporate filings.Fyffes says it has distributed the fruit since the 19th century, when it made a shipment to London from the Canary Islands.McCann and his family have led Fyffes since the 1950s when his father Neil joined the business, according to company statements.Lonergan first suggested the deal when he met the Fyffes Chairman at a fruit conference in New Orleans in October, McCann said in today in an interview.“Between us, we can provide any type of banana that a retailer wants,” Lonergan said in the same interview.Balkan Investment Co., an entity run by the McCanns, controls about 13 percent of Fyffes and intends to vote for the deal. The Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust, which controls about 13 percent of Fyffes, also has committed to backing the merger. Other shareholders include Fidelity Investment funds, which control about 20 percent.The biggest holders in Chiquita include Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc., who control almost 20 percent combined.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is acting as lead financial adviser to Chiquita, and Wells Fargo Securities LLC as financial adviser to the Chiquita board of directors. Lazard Ltd. is lead financial adviser to Fyffes.

626	"By Dean Best | 10 March 2014Font size    Email  PrintChiquita and Fyffes among two of our companies that account for 80% of banana sales worldwideAn extended geographic presence, a wider product portfolio and a broader supply base are among the benefits from the merger of Chiquita Brands International and Fyffes, the produce giants said today (10 March).The two companies this morning set out a deal to create ChiquitaFyffes, a business that will become the largest supplier of bananas worldwide.Speaking to analysts on a conference call after the proposed merger was announced, Ed Lonergan, the Chiquita CEO set to be the chairman of the combined company, said the three factors were ""critically important"" to the new group.""We don't tend to operate on top of one another with our brands. There's a de minimis overlap of the Fyffes brand and the Chiquita brand. The combination of Fyffes' geographies and Chiquita's geographies was truly compelling,"" Lonergan said.Chiquita and Fyffes are, with Dole Food Co. and Fresh Del Monte Produce, four suppliers that account for 80% of the banana market. However, Lonergan said Chiquita and Fyffes did not expect to encounter concerns from market regulators, particularly in parts of Europe where both companies have notable positions.""We don't think there are any issues we can't address in the regulatory process,"" Lonergan said.The Chiquita boss, meanwhile, said the combined business, which would have annual sales of around US$4.6bn, would benefit from an expanded product range. ""The opportunity to have brands, organic, Fairtrade, private label all from one company is quite compelling for our customer base,"" he said. The companies insisted they would keep both of their namesake brands.Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who is set to be the new CEO of ChiquitaFyffes, told analysts the larger business would be better able to counter volatility in the banana market caused by external factors.""Tog, our supply operations will benefit from the broadest geographical diversity in the industry, enabling the company to better meet customer and consumer needs for variety and better insulate the company from weather and other disruptions in any given area,"" he said.The companies also see financial benefits from the transaction, including cost savings. They have set a target of ""annualised pre-tax cost synergies"" of US$40m by the end of 2016.""We are very confident in the $40m of synergies we've identified, primarily in operations - growing, procuring and shipping our product. There are simple choices around the number of vessels we can run, comb the streams of product flow we have acr the oceans,"" Lonergan said. ""We are also quite confident that as we continue to work together over the course of the coming years we'll find ways to operate more efficiently as we proceed.""The stock-for-stock transaction will see investors in US-based Chiquita own around 50.7% of what will be called ChiquitaFyffes. Shareholders in Ireland's Fyffes will own the other 49.3%.Under the terms of the deal, Fyffes shareholders will receive 0.1567 ChiquitaFyffes shares for each share they hold in the Ireland-based firm. Chiquita investors will receive one ChiquitaFyffes share for each share they own in the US group.The transaction values Fyffes at approximately US$526m and each Fyffes share at EUR1.22, which represents a premium of approximately 36% compared to the company's volume-weighted average trading price for the 30 trading days up until 7 March and a 38% premium to the Fyffes closing share price that day.On that basis, the transaction will result in a combined equity value of approximately $1.07bn.P.S: If you liked this article, you might enjoy the just-food newsletter.

The companies said the combination would create the No. 1 banana company globally, with a 14% market share, and would lead to $40 million in annual cost savings and synergies and allow further opportunities to improve operational leverage. Now what: The deal will be subject to the usual regulatory scrutiny, but analysts expect the merger to go through as the companies primarily deal in different parts of the world, Chiquita in North America and Fyffes in Europe. Investors on both sides clearly seem to approve of the merger as Fyffes' shares jumped 44% on the news, but several analysts said the deal is reflective of weakness in the industry and could prompt further consolidation. Merging two corporate cultures is also sometimes rougher than expected. Chiquita and Fyffes expect the deal to close by the end of the year. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned, and neither does The Motley Fool.

                Chiquita Brands International (CQB) and Irish fruit seller Fyffes agreed on Monday to a $1.07 billion merger, creating the world’s largest banana company.Continue Reading BelowThe all-stock deal will create a new company, ChiquitaFyffes, with sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas. Combined, the two fruit firms have 32,000 employees and about $4.6 billion in annual revenue.Chiquita’s shareholders will own 50.7% of the new company’s stock upon completion of the deal. Shares of ChiquitaFyffes will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and domiciled in Ireland.Fyffes and Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita said the combined company, which would surpass privately owned Dole Food as the top supplier of bananas worldwide, will maintain offices in Dublin and North Carolina.Chiquita jumped 15.6% to $12.53 shortly after the opening bell. Through Friday’s close, the stock was up 60.8% over the last 12 months.Fyffes executive chairman David McCann will lead the new company as its chief executive. Chiquita CEO Ed Lonergan will serve as chairman of ChiquitaFyffes.Continue Reading BelowADVERTISEMENT“This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies which, we believe, will create significant value for our shareholders and offer immediate benefits for customers and consumers worldwide,” Lonergan said.Lonergan added that the companies will maintain their current brands, while the new company will provide customers with a more diverse product mix.In addition to its banana sales, the companies said ChiquitaFyffes will have a significant presence in packaged salads, melons and pineapples. They are targeting about $40 million in annualized pre-tax cost synergies by 2016.The deal, which is expected to close later this year, could face some antitrust scrutiny from regulators. According to the United Nations, Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole and Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP) account for more than 80% of the global banana market.Chiquita and Fyffes both have long histories. Chiquita’s founding dates back to 1870, when Lorenzo Dow Baker brought Jamaican bananas to Jersey City, N.J.During World War II, the company’s operations were brought to a standstill while its ships were used by the U.S. government. Chiquita expanded its footprint after the war, advertising its bananas using a cartoon banana named “Miss Chiquita.”Fyffes was born in 1888 when Edward Wathen Fyffe sold bananas from the Canary Islands in London.Click the button below to comment on this article.Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

 DUBLIN — Yes, they have more bananas.  Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world's biggest banana supplier.  The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.  The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.  Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.  The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.  Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at $1.66.  Fyffes rose 46 percent to $1.80 on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York.  Fyffes, pronounced ""Fifes,"" is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.  David McCann, Fyffes' chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.  Lonergan said their ""natural strategic partnership"" would ""provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.""  However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.

637	Reuters Staff4 Min Read* Combined company will have 14-15 pct market share * ChiquitaFyffes will have $4.6 bln annual sales * Deal may raise competition issues * Fairtrade campaigners worry about further pressure By Sam Cage DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. fruit firm Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe’s largest distributor, have struck an all-stock deal to create the world’s biggest banana supplier. With the $526 million tie-up, the new firm will grab some 14 percent of the global banana market, and considerable negotiating power at a time when supermarkets are cutting prices for their product owing to an economic downturn. “Two big fruit companies have felt the downward pressure of the big retail buyers on their margins and consolidation appears to them to be a strategy for survival,” said Bananalink, a British-based group which works for more sustainable trade in bananas and pineapples. The global banana market, worth $7 billion, is currently controlled by four multinationals, according to the United Nations: Chiquita, Fresh Del Monte, Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company and Fyffes. Chiquita and Fyffes sell 180 million boxes of bananas a year between them, versus 117 million for Del Monte and 110 for Dole. The combined ChiquitaFyffes will have $4.6 billion in annual revenues and expects to make operational pre-tax savings of at least $40 million by the end of 2016. “The first three (companies) on a global scale are not too far away from each other, whereas Fyffes was a good deal smaller. Now a firm number one has been created, there will be some impetus for further consolidation in the sector,” said David Holohan, an analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin. The new firm will be listed in New York - though domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes - and have a market value of $1.1 billion. Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the combined company and Fyffes shareholders the remaining 49.3 percent, the companies said. The deal will be subject to review by competition authorities but, Holohan added, is unlikely to prompt burdensome regulatory demands because the two companies operate mainly in separate North American and European markets. Chiquita Chief Executive Ed Lonergan, who will be chairman of the combined company, was confident the match of the businesses would persuade regulators to give it the green light, with most of the savings expected in logistics. “We looked at it and thought we could create a much stronger competitor,” Lonergan told Reuters. “The overlap between the businesses is de minimis.” Fyffes shares leaped 44 percent on Monday, bringing the stock, which had traded at about 10 times earnings prior to the announcement, roughly into line with its peers Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38 percent over its Friday’s closing price. Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as financial advisers for Chiquita and its board and Lazard for Fyffes. Most bananas are grown for export on large plantations in Latin America and Africa and are from a single variety. This standardises taste and brings economies of scale but leaves the bananas vulnerable to diseases which can require extensive fungicide treatment, a potential hazard to local ecosystems. Campaigners for sustainable farming expressed concern that the ChiquitaFyffes tie-up could intensify the economic pressure on small-scale banana producers, as well as environmental hazards. “The banana market is dysfunctional and this merger feels like further proof,” said Michael Gidney, chief executive of British charity The Fairtrade Foundation. “There’s downward pressure that’s creating a race for the bottom. The big producers are under pressure too - the banana business is not working for anybody.” All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

											Alistair Osborne, Business Editor5:25PM GMT 10 Mar 2014 Two of the world’s oldest fruit suppliers are joining forces via a $1.1bn (£660m) all-share merger to create the biggest banana business on the planet.  North Carolina-based Chiquita Brands and Dublin-headquartered Fyffes said they were creating a fresh produce company employing 32,000 people in more than 70 countries, with $4.6bn of annual sales.  The enlarged group, 50.7pc-owned by Chiquita shareholders and 49.3pc by Fyffes, will sell more than 160m boxes of bananas a year as well as having significant clout in the world of melons, pineapples and packaged salads.  The new group aims, it said, to capitalise on “the growing fresh food business and health and wellness trends by more effectively utilising its geographical footprint and expanded distribution channels”.  “This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes,” said Ed Lonergan, Chiquita’s chief executive, who will chair the new ChiquitaFyffes business. It will be listed on the New York stock exchange and domiciled in Ireland.

 News of the deal sent shares in Fyffes rocketing 40 cents to €1.29 in Dublin, its highest level since 2000, with the transaction valuing the company at €1.22 a share, a 38pc premium to Friday’s closing price.  Shares in Chiquita also jumped, rising more than 12pc to $12.15, as the market warmed to a mooted $40m of annual synergies by the end of 2016, not from job cuts but savings on shipping, packaging and procurement.  The merger combines two groups steeped in history. Fyffes dates back to the 1880s when EW Fyffe Son & Co took its first delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands.  Its more recent history has seen the involvement of three generations of the family of executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the combined group.  His grandfather, Charles McCann, started a green grocer’s shop in Dundalk in the early 1900s, becoming the first agent for Fyffes bananas in Ireland. His son, Neil McCann, subsequently built the fruit import business that acquired Fyffes in 1986.  Hailing the deal as “transformative”, David McCann said the “larger, more diverse business” offered more “opportunities for growth”. Balkan Investment Company, the vehicle for the McCann family’s 12.5pc stake, has given irrevocable undertakings to vote for the deal.  Another Fyffes investor, the Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust with 13.1pc of the shares, is also expected to back the merger.  Chiquita started importing fruit more than 140 years ago, when Captain Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica, sailed to Jersey City in 11 days and sold them for a profit.  One potential banana skin remains in the shape of the competition authorities as only four companies – Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole and Fresh Del Monte Produce – control more than 80pc of the global banana trade.

DUBLIN, Ireland - Yes, they have more bananas.
Fruit supply companies Chiquita (NYSE:CQB, Stock Forum) of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland (GREY:FYFFF, Stock Forum) said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world's biggest banana supplier.
The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.
The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.
Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.
The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.
Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66).
Fyffes rose 46 per cent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 per cent to $12.20 in New York.
Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.
David McCann, Fyffes' chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.
Lonergan said their ""natural strategic partnership'' would ""provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.''
However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.

646	Fyffes and Chiquita to form company that will sell more than 160million boxes of the fruit per yearIrish based fruit supplier Fyffes is merging with rival Chiquita to create the world’s largest banana company.The two firms are joining forces to form a monster fruit firm that will dwarf their rivals in the banana distribution market.The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of e3.3. billion from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide.Chiquita is the larger of the two company with annual revenues of €2.6billion and 20,000 staff. Shareholders in the firm based in North  Carolina will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at €380million. The two companies confirmed the existing brands will be kept but customers will have access to a wider choice of products.Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the new business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.“We believe we can use our complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced from countries including Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including Dublin Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan said the deal was a “milestone transaction” which “brings together the best of both companies”.He added: “The combined company will provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.“We know Fyffes well and our shared heritage will ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies.”news@irishmirror.ie	Business

Ask yourself one question: How much should a banana empire be worth? It is a very legitimate question, and the answer is simply “less than you might think.” News broke on Monday that Chiquita Brands International Inc. (NYSE: CQB) is merging with Fyffes PLC.The news might not sound like much on the surface, but this goes beyond bananas. It also goes beyond borders. Both of the boards of directors unanimously approved the definitive merger agreement.As far as how this will work out, Chiquita will combine with Fyffes in a stock-for-stock transaction that gives Chiquita’s shareholders an ownership stake of 50.7% of the new company, which will be named ChiquitaFyffes.Monday’s statement said, “The agreement creates a global banana and other fresh produce company with approximately $4.6 billion in annual revenues. Chiquita and Fyffes plan to complete the transaction before the end of 2014.”Here are some of the details of a post-merger review:The NewCo will have a combined equity value of approximately $1.07 billion, and it will be the number one banana company globally. The move also expands its branding in packaged salads, as well as in melons and pineapples. There is a tax angle here as well — The combined ChiquitaFyffes plc will continue to be Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but the NewCo will be domiciled in Ireland. It is also targeting $40 million in pre-tax cost synergies by the end of 2016.Ed Lonergan, CEO of the current Chiquita Brands, will serve as chairman. David McCann, Fyffe’s executive chairman, will become CEO of the combined company. Monday’s release also confirmed that ChiquitaFyffes will have an operating presence in more than 70 countries and will employ close to 32,000 people around the world.The new company is projected to have an aggregate EBITDA in 2013 of approximately $214 million on a pro forma basis, with a pro forma combined synergy adjusted net debt to EBITDA of 2.7 times. It will also have more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America.Chiquita Brands saw its shares rise 12% to $12.15, against a 52-week range of $6.04 to $13.68. Fyffes saw its shares up more than 40% in London trading and in Dublin trading. Any time you see both companies trading handily higher after merger news, it generally means that they are viewed as being “pro-investor.”Chiquita’s $573 million seems low for being the top global banana brand in the world, particularly when you add in the Fresh Express salad brands along with its other products. Maybe this is just how the math works out, but an empire of this size would just seem to be worth more on the surface when you consider the might of the world’s food companies and how many billionaires and private equity giants are out there right now.By Jon C.

                                        Yes, they have more bananas: Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland announced today they had agreed to merge to create the world's biggest banana supplier. The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes, which will be headquartered in Dublin, also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.
                                    
                                        Fyffes is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929.

However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate. The deal requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the US.

Analysts and traders attributed Vodafone's drop to the fact the company had to raise its initial bid for Spanish cable group Ono.  Mt Gox asks for court protection during Japan bakruptcy  15.35 Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo last month, started a related case in the US, blaming its failure on a software flaw in the digital currency.  Mt. Gox asked the US Bankruptcy Court in Dallas to protect any US-based assets the company may have while it tries to reorganize under the authority of the Japanese court. Mt. Gox last month said almost 750,000 customer Bitcoins and 100,000 of its own were missing and were probably stolen.  “The facts known to date indicate that it was caused or related to a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies Bitcoin, and ‘hacking’ attacks of one or more persons,” Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said in a sworn statement filed in Dallas.  The Tokyo-based exchange filed for bankruptcy in a Japanese court after losing Bitcoins worth about $473m at the time-about 7pc of all Bitcoins in existence worldwides.  The US bankruptcy case was filed partly to halt lawsuits against the company while it tries to reorganize in Japan and repay creditors. Last month, Mt. Gox was sued by an Illinois resident accusing it of misappropriation and fraud in federal court in Chicago.   Cyprus central bank governor resigns   15.17 Cypriot Central Bank governor Panicos Demetriades has submitted his resignation, which was accepted by President Nicos Anastasiades, an official statement said.  Reuters reported that the reason for his resignation was not immediately clear, but he has had testy relations with the centre-right government, and Anastasiades had said in September he was seeking his removal. Demetriades has been in his post for almost two years.  Demetriades represents Cyprus on the ECB governing council. The ECB had no immediate comment. A statement from Cyprus's presidency said Demetriades would work out his notice and step down on April 10.  Cyprus has released this statement:   The Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus, Mr Panicos Demetriades, today submitted his resignation to the President of the Republic, Mr Nicos Anastasiades, and the resignation was accepted.   According to Mr Demetriades’ contract a month’s notice is required, and for that reason his resignation will be effective as of April 10. During this period, Mr Demetriades will deal with the pending issues before him and will brief his successor.   Mr Demetriades’ letter of resignation was handed today, in Brussels, to the Minister of Finance, Mr Harris Georgiades, in the presence of a European Central Bank representative.   The President of the Republic thanked Mr Demetriades for his contribution in the great effort that has been undertaken over the past year to rescue the country from bankruptcy and to stabilize the financial sector.    'Manly ice cream' in attempt to boost Cornetto sales  15.05 Ice cream cones and 99 flakes are in decline as consumers buy tubs and luxury brands, according to The Independent.  In 2013, we bought 22m more 500ml tubs of ice cream than the year before. But cones proved less popular, with volume sales down 5.5 per cent.  In an attempt to fight the luxury brands, Cornetto manufacturer has revealed the Choc 'n' Ball, which is being marketed as the “ultimate manly ice cream”.  Unilever said it ""caters specifically for male consumers seeking a substantial snack offering"".   Capita named as preferred bidder by the Ministry of Defence   14.47 Capita has been selected as preferred bidder by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to be the strategic business partner for the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), according to a statement by Capita.  The company will lead a partnership to ""manage and transform"" the UK's national and international defence infrastructure.  The 10-year contract could be worth around £400 million to Capita.  &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Peter Hoskins - &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23Capita"" target=""_blank""&gt;#Capita&lt;/a&gt; named as preferred bidder for 10-year contract to manage UK government's &amp;#163;21bn military estate, gaining edge over rival &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23Serco"" target=""_blank""&gt;#Serco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/noframe&gt; Global markets fall after weak data from Asia   14.32 Following disappointing figures from Japan and China, global shares have fallen with Wall Street opening down.

It is hardly a mega-deal on the scale of AOL/Time Warner, but when it comes to fresh fruit, the $1bn merger of Fyffes and Chiquita is big bananas. If the combination goes ahead, the enlarged group will become a powerhouse for pineapples, melons and prepared salads, selling $4.6bn worth of produce every year. But as a banana behemoth, ChiquitaFyffes will face scrutiny before its creation is approved.   The terms give shareholders in North Carolina-based Chiquita 50.7pc of the new entity, with Fyffes, headquartered in Ireland, taking the rest. That bakes in a premium for Fyffes, which would otherwise naturally own 42pc of the group, pro-rata, for its contribution to the pair's $876m combined value using Friday's share prices.   What Chiquita shareholders lose in paying the premium, they should make back, and more, on the synergies. These are put at $40m annually before tax. Assume they have a net present value of $300m and the new group could be worth close to $1.2 bn.   The biggest potential banana skin is antitrust and the market is already wary. Shares in Fyffes were trading at 89 euro cents at the end of last week. They jumped to around 1.30 euros as the deal was outlined on March 10. The increase reflects the merger premium, but falls short of the full synergy value.  Icahn versus eBay  13.41 Investor Carl Icahn has written an open letter criticising eBay's chief executive and is calling for PayPaul to split from eBay.   eBay CEO John Donahoe oversaw a premature sale of Skype at a diminished price that resulted in eBay stockholders losing over $4 billion as compared to the sale of Skype to Microsoft 18 months later.  But Pierre Omidyar, founder and chairman of eBay, has hit back, accusing Mr Icahn of ""making unsubstantiated claims about our company -- and deliberately impugning the integrity of our directors"".  His letter is here and there are several other updates from the company here.   Khodorkovsky applies to settle in Switzerland  13.32 Former Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky has submitted a request to settle permanently in Switzerland, a spokeswoman said.  Once Russia's richest man, Khodorkovsky was jailed in 2003 for fraud and tax evasion. He was seen by many as a political prisoner, the highest-profile victim of President Vladimir Putin's campaign to rein in the ""oligarchs"" who had made fortunes snapping up assets in the chaotic years of Boris Yeltsin's rule following the collapse of Soviet communism. Khodorkovsky, who was released from a Russian prison camp near the Arctic Circle last December, has spent much of the last few months travelling.  The 50-year-old former oil tycoon was granted a three-month Schengen visa by Switzerland at the end of last year and arrived by train in Basel from Berlin at the start of January to take his two youngest sons back to school.  A spokeswoman for Khodorkovsky confirmed he had submitted a request for permanent residency in Switzerland, but she declined to give any further details on where exactly he was hoping to make his home.  Charlie Bean: bank keeping a 'beady eye' on roaring housing market  13.15 The Bank of England’s stability board is “keeping a beady eye” on Britain’s roaring property market, Charlie Bean has said, amid warnings that the economic recovery is too reliant on house prices and consumer spending.  Mr Bean, the deputy governor of monetary policy at the Bank, told the North East Chamber of Commerce that there were “unmistakable signs that a robust recovery is under way” in the UK. But he said that so far not enough growth was being built on the stable pillars of business investment, higher productivity and exports.   To date much of the recovery has been on the back of higher consumer spending and housing investment,” he said.  He pointed out that last year consumer spending rose 2.2pc while housing investment jumped almost 10pc. See our full story here.   Gold trades below four-month high   13.07 Gold was little changed below a four-month high in New York as investors weighed the crisis in Ukraine against the case for the Federal Reserve to keep reducing stimulus  Gold posted a weekly gain of 1.3pc last week, even after dropping 1pc on March 7, as tension between Ukraine and Russia escalated, boosting demand for a haven. Pro-Russian forces advanced in the Crimean peninsula, ignoring Western calls to halt a military takeover before the region holds a referendum on separation.  Bullion rose 11pc this year, rebounding from the biggest annual drop since 1981, even as the Fed announced a $10bn reduction to bond buying at each of its past two meetings, leaving purchases at $65bn.    12.30 Back in the stock market, Vodafone is a heavy faller, losing 2.7pc following reports the telecoms group has raised its bid for Spanish cable group Ono to €7bn. The wider FTSE 100, hindered by broad-based weakness among the mining shares, is now down 2 points at 6,710.  McDonald's sales drop  12.17 McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.3pc in February as its US business slumped for the fourth straight month. Analysts had estimated a 0.1 pc decline.  McDonald’s, which has more than 14,200 US locations, has been trying to attract Americans by advertising coffee and breakfast foods. The Big Mac seller recently began testing raspberry pastries in San Diego stores as fast-food chains compete to lure diners amid shaky consumer confidence.  US sales in February were hurt by “severe winter weather,” the company said in the statement.   Malaysian Air shares at record low   11.55 Malaysian Airline System fell to an all-time low after the national carrier’s Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing two days ago.  The stock sank 4pc to 24 sen for its lowest close on record after falling as much as 18pc. It was the most active on Kuala Lumpur’s exchange with 385m shares traded. The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index slid 0.6pc and the ringgit slumped 0.8pc against the dollar.  Investigators from nine countries are struggling to solve the mystery of the missing Malaysian jet, as Vietnamese forces today failed to find the airplane debris they had spotted yesterday off the country’s southern coast. The prospect of terrorism is being investigated after Austria and Italy said passports used by two male passengers were stolen from their citizens.   What was initially believed to be a piece of debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane   The great shard debate  11.31 Last week, the New York Times published a piece claiming that Britain's main business is laundering oligarch's dirty billions and London is a city where the uber-rich are celebrated ""and migrants are exploited but that pretends to be a multicultural utopia"".  Now, we probably shouldn't pay any attention to such groundless insults. We should probably hold our heads high and ignore it.  But... just for the fun of it, here's a very full rebuttal from Sean Thomas.   So there are no Slavic oligarchs living it up in the Shard. There are no naked hookers stretched out on tiger skins. There are no mile-high apartments full of trillionaire villains. There are no incomprehensible derivatives being traded beneath them. There are no elevators “full” of African cleaners – as the place is all but empty. So most of these “non-existent people” are, in point of fact, non-existent, which is probably why Londoners regard them as not existing.   Apart from that, great article.     Expect to see more food mergers?  11.17 Parmjit Singh, head of the food and drink group at Eversheds global law firm, believes the news of Fyffes and Chiquita banana companies merging is just a taste of things to come.   The news that Fyffes and Chiquita are merging will not come as a surprise. For many food producers this is a natural next step to meet the pressure to achieve cost efficiencies, improve shareholder returns and attract investment. Retailers have enjoyed strong negotiating positions over the last decade with food producers and these types of mergers are intended to help food producers to gain some parity on those negotations. As consumer confidence improves around the world, expect to see more of these types of mergers in the global food and drink sector.  Ukrainian tensions push corn trades to record highs  11.06 Russia’s incursion into Ukraine has led to concerns that corn supplies will be disrupted if tensions escalated, and has caused record options trading in a security that tracks corn.  Investors are piling into contracts on the Teucrium Corn Fund, which tracks US prices for the grain used in everything from motor fuel to soft-drink sweetener. A record of more than 16,000 call options giving the right to buy the exchange-traded fund changed hands last week as prices for bullish contracts rose to a three-year high compared with puts.  Joe Vaclavik, president of Standard Grain brokerage and consulting firm said:   Export demand has been very good.The Ukraine story has fueled the fire.   Zero-hours contracts rising  10.52 The ONS has admitted that 582,935 employees were on zero-hours contracts last year, more than double the 250,000 estimated by the Government in AUgust.  Zero-hours contracts are used in social care, retail and hotels, and mean the employees are not required to work a set number of hours and are only paid for hours worked.  But ONS has said the figures may change, as the question depends on employees correctly knowing their terms of employmenbt.  ONS's first employer-based estimates of zero-hours contracts are expected in April.  &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Lucy Rigby - ONS says that last year 582,935 people in Britain were employed on &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23zerohours"" target=""_blank""&gt;#zerohours&lt;/a&gt; contracts. That's more than double the Govt's estimate.&lt;/noframe&gt; French industrial output unexpectedly falls   10.42 French industrial production unexpectedly fell for a second month and business confidence declined, indicating the recovery may struggle to build momentum this quarter.  Output dropped 0.2pc in January from December, led by electricity and gas production, the country’s statistics office in Paris said today. Economists had forecast a 0.3pc increase. A separate report showed an index of business sentiment declined to 98 in February from 99 the previous month.  Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Group in London, said:   The overall picture is less weak than headline figures suggest but France is certainly struggling to gain momentum. The French factory sector remains extremely fragile.    Unilver's majority stake in Chinese water company  10.27 Over the weekend, Unilver bought a majority stake in Qinyuan, a Chinese company that makes water purifiers and water treatment.  The world's second largest consumer goods company did not reveal the sum paid but said it was its biggest Chinese purchase in more than ten years.  Quartz has a report on why it's a sensible purchase.   It’s a smart move for a company whose business depends heavily on emerging markets like China that have proved volatile recently—Unilever makes almost 60pc of its sales in China and other emerging markets, compared to Procter & Gamble’s 39pc.   Water purification is one of the country’s most reliable consumer goods category, thanks to China’s persistent water pollution problems. An estimated 300m people, almost a quarter of the population, drink contaminated water on a daily basis. China’s expanding middle class doesn’t trust city water—and sometimes not even bottled water—and is splurging on home and office purification systems like those made by Qinyuan, which had sales of about $200m in 2013.    Tesco's finance director 'could leave within months'  10.05 Tensions between Tesco's finance director and chief executive mean that Laurie McIlwee, who has been Tesco's chief financial officer since 2009, could leave the company within months, according to Sky News.  Mark Klelnman reports that city investors have expressed doubts about Mr McIlwee, and there have been senior level discussions about his position since Tesco abandoned its key profit margin target last month.  Mr McIlwee is said to have an ""uncomfortable working with relationship"" with Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive, according to Sky.  The change would be the latest upheaval for Tesco, who is facing strong competition from discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl.  &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Mark Kleinman - Exclusive: Tesco paves way for departure of finance director Laurie McIlwee amid tensions with CEO Philip Clarke. &lt;a href=""http://t.co/5Y5ouPyaPG"" target=""_blank""&gt;http://t.co/5Y5ouPyaPG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;  09.42 Back in the stock market, engine-maker Rolls-Royce is among the biggest risers, up 2.5pc after it was disclosed on Friday evening that it would buy-out Daimler’s 50pc stake in their power systems joint venture. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andy Chamber said:  The acquisition should be modestly accretive as RR generates little income from its cash and Rolls-Royce Power Systems contributed almost £300m to earnings before interest and taxes last year (15pc).  French central bank holds Q1 growth forecast at 0.2pc  09.13 The French economy is expected to grow by 0.2pc in the first quarter, the country's central bank said Monday, confirming a preliminary forecast issued a month ago.  The bank makes its forecasts based on a monthly survey of a panel of private sector executives, who have reported that business confidence remained largely unchanged in February.  The central bank noted that industrial production was ""steady"" across almost all sectors in February. This was particularly so in the chemical, pharmaceutical as well as machines and equipments industries.  ""Deliveries are intensifying"" while ""the order books are filling out somewhat"", said the bank which also expects business activity to improve slightly in March.  In the services sector, a ""slight rise in activity"" is seen in March.   Weak China data hits miners   09.04 Over in the FTSE 100, weak economic data from China - the world's biggest metals consumer - has hit mining shares, with Glencore Xstrata down 1.7pc, Anglo American off 1.6pc and Antofagasta 1.3pc lower. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at broker Interactive Investor, said:   China's 7.5pc growth target may only be a week old, but it is already under threat from some truly awful export numbers. The shock drop in exports raises serious questions about how realistic Chinese growth prospects are and casts doubt on their current target. This increased uncertainly is not helpful for either the commodity market or wider global equity markets.  Asian markets down  08.28 Asian stock markets are down, battered by weak Chinese trade and a reduced estimate for Japan's economic growth. Shares in Malaysia Airlines tumbled on news of the weekend disappearance of one its jets enroute to Beijing.  Japan's Nikkei closed down 1pc and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.75pc.  Markets were also down in Australia, Taiwan, South Korea and Southeast Asia.  Data released on the weekend showed China's exports fell by an unexpectedly large 18 pc in February, possibly denting hopes trade will help drive the slowing economy while communist leaders push ambitious reforms.  China's official 2014 economic growth target of 7.5pc, announced last week by Premier Li Keqiang, assumes trade also will grow by 7.5pc. But customs data show combined imports and exports so far this year have shrunk by 4.8pc.    08.15 Europe's main stock markets fell at the start of trading on Monday, with London's benchmark FTSE 100 index down 0.1pc.  Frankfurt's DAX 30 slid 0.48pc to 9,305.51 points and in Paris the CAC 40 dipped 0.08pc to 4,363.02 compared with Friday's closing values.

Banana companies merge   07.50 Chiquita and Fyffes have combined to create the world's largest banana company.

Japan's deficit hits record as economic growth disappoints   07.30 Japan's current account deficit grew to a record 1.5trn yen (£8.7bn) in January, the largest since records began in 1985.  The deficit is far above estimates for a 1.4trn yen deficit as shipments failed to increase despite a weaker yen.  The country's fourth quarter growth was revised down with Japan's economy growing at an annual rate of just 0.7pc in 2013, below the estimates of 1pc.  The disappointing figures add to a recent run of soft indicators that have raised doubts about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's strategy to spark sustainable growth through massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as structural reforms.  ""Abenomics"" helped the economy grow above an annual clip of 4pc in the first half of last year - the best among advanced economies - but growth slowed to below 1pc in the second half as exports, capital spending and private consumption lagged.  The Bank of Japan began a two-day policy review today amid growing expectations the central bank will further ease policy as early as next month to steer the economy through some speed bumps.

 maintains a network of unlimited Irish entities to avoid higher corporate taxes on billions of dollars of revenue it earns abroad. (Read more about it in this article in the Irish Times.)In 2012, Chiquita’s income taxes resulted in a net expense of $105 million, reversing a net tax benefit the year before of $82 million. Much of the reversal had to do with establishing valuation allowances against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. It’s complicated stuff. But the company was clearly not pleased with the outcome, and said so in its annual report. So moving its corporate accounts to Ireland might actually simplify the taxation process as well as lighten the burden.With operations in over 70 countries, Chiquita is no stranger to doing business abroad.

DUBLIN, Ireland — Yes, they have more bananas.
Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world’s biggest banana supplier.
The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.
The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.
Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.
The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world’s No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.
Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday’s deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66).
Fyffes rose 46 per cent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 per cent to $12.20 in New York.
Fyffes is Europe’s biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company’s presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.
David McCann, Fyffes’ chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.
Lonergan said their “natural strategic partnership” would “provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.”
However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren’t expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.

Irish fruit distributor Fyffes and US rival Chiquita have agreed to merge in an all-stock deal, which is expected to be completed before the end of the year.According to the companies, the combined entity – named ChiquitaFyffes – would have revenue of around $4.6bn and will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.On completion, Chiquita’s shareholders will own around 50.7% of ChiquitaFyffes, with Fyffes’ shareholders owning around 49.3%. Additionally, the companies expect to achieve around $40m in pre-tax cost savings by the end of 2016.With a market capitalisation of around €260m, Fyffes distributes bananas (its largest product category), pineapples and melons.With revenue predominantly from Europe, Fyffes lags competitors in terms of scale – reporting revenue of around €1.1bn and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of €40m in fiscal 2013.Being part of a much larger entity with broader reach and products makes sense for Fyffes. As for Chiquita, which has a market capitalisation of some $500m, its product base consists of bananas (also its largest product category) as well as salads and healthy snacks (that includes Chiquita bites).Although with a broad geographic reach, a large proportion of the company’s revenue – which came in at some $3bn in 2013, EBITDA of $117m – is derived from North America.But Chiquita, whose turnaround efforts have just started to bear fruit, has been faced with declining revenue over recent years. That’s aside from a stretched balance sheet (as at December 2013, net debt was $576m), which has weighed on the company.The merger should create a more financially flexible company, the companies reckon the combined entity’s pro-forma net debt to EBITDA would be 2.7x – Chiquita was 4.9x as at December 2013.The larger combo would be better positioned to face off against other global players in the sector, Fresh Del Monte for example, which boasts a relatively decent balance sheet and made EBITDA of $185m on revenue of around $3.7bn last year.The move certainly bodes well for both companies, although expectations here are that rivals are unlikely to sit idly by.  From time to time, GAIN Capital Limited’s (“we”, “our”) website may contain links to other sites and/or resources provided by third parties.

658	Chiquita Brands International Inc. has reached an agreement over the acquisition of Fyffes Plc in an all-stock transaction, which is estimated to about 526 million dollars and is also expected to create the largest banana company in the world with annual revenue of almost 5 billion dollars. The new company is forecast to be able to meet the increasing demand for bananas globally and is projected to make some improvements to shipping. Mr. Patrick Higgins, who is an analyst working at Goodbody Stockbrokers approved of the move, saying for the Financial Times: “The industry has been suffering from overcapacity for the past few years so a combination of the two major players should resolve some of the volatility of the market.” The companies made an official joint statement today, revealing that after being finalized, the deal is expected to create a business that will be able to generate about 4.6 billion dollars of annual revenue. The new entity will be named ChiquitaFyffes Plc and will have about 32,000 employees. The future market value of ChiquitaFyffes is estimated to more than 1 billion dollars. About 50.7% of the new entity will be held by the shareholders of Chiquita, and the rest of the shares will be held by the investors of Fyffes.One of the analysts working for Merrion Capital – Mr. David Holohan, commented the announcement for Bloomberg: “The deal is logical and will be a good fit going forward for both parties. This is an excellent result for Fyffes.”The new entity will be put under the charge of the current Chief Executive Officer of Chiquita – Ed Lonergan, who will be appointed at the position of Chairman. Mr. Lonergan said in an interview cited by the Wall Street Journal: “This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies.” Chiquita Brands International Inc. jumped by 11.90% in New York by 15:50 GMT, marking a one-year change of 79.67%. The company is valued at $507.67 billion. According to the Financial Times, the 2 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Chiquita Brands International Inc. have a median target of $14.00, with a high estimate of $15.00 and a low estimate of $13.00. The median estimate represents a 29.15% increase from the previous close of $10.84Fyffes Plc jumped by 46.07% to close 1.30 euro in Dublin, marking a one-year change of +107.34%. According to the Financial Times, the one analyst offering a 12 month price target expects Fyffes Plc share price to rise to 0.98 euro in the next year from the previous close of 0.89 euro.Founded in 2013, Binary Tribune aims at providing its readers accurate and actual financial news coverage.

Chiquita shareholders will own approximately 50.7 percent of ChiquitaFyffes.Both Chiquita and Fyffes have historic backgrounds in the banana market. Chiquita, founded in 1870, was one of the first companies to market branded bananas and helped the fruit gain popularity in the U.S. following World War II. Fyffes, which began shipping bananas in 1888, claims to be the world's oldest fruit brand as it started sticking blue labels on all its produce in 1929. The modern banana market is at a point of flux, as new innovations and challenges transform the industry. Recent improvements in shipping technology has allowed bananas' life span to more than double, with exports of bananas increasing by 7.3 percent in 2012 to an all-time high of 16.5 million tons. At the same time, new fungi may threaten the global industry as we know it. Related: Inventor of the Cronut Reveals His Latest CreationAdd your favorite articles, videos, podcasts, and more to your Queue so you can enjoy them anytime on any device.Be the first to get inspirational content - handpicked and delivered to your inbox.Take control of what content you see.

3.10.14 11:45 AM EST  By Ashlee Kieler@akielerBanana Chiquta Fyffes merger Now That's Bananas(frankieleon)Miss Chiquita is getting hitched to an Irishman. The 144-year-old banana company is set to merge with its European rival, Fyffes, in a deal that would create the world’s biggest banana supplier. (frankieleon)Charlotte, North Carolina-based fruit company Chaiquita Brands announced Monday it is merging with Ireland-based Fyffes in an all-stock deal valued at $1.1 billion, Reuters reports. The new company, which will be named ChiquitaFyffes, will control nearly 14% of the banana supplier market well ahead of Fresh Del Monte and Dole Food Company. “This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies,” Ed Lonergan, Chaquita chief executive says. Officials with the new company say the merger will bring new opportunities to the industry. ChiquitaFyffes is estimated to have $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas. With approximately 32,000 employees, the new company will be based in Ireland where it will receive operational pre-tax savings of at least $40 million by the end of 2016. The merger will be subject to review by competition authorities, but company officials say it is unlikely to face opposition as the two companies operate in different markets.

News Feedback Chiquita Brands International of the US and Fyffes 
of Ireland said today they 
have agreed to combine in an all-stock transaction valued at about $1.07bn, that 
will be the world’s largest banana company.Chiquita shareholders would own 50.7% of the new company, ChiquitaFyffes, which 
would have $4.6bn in annual revenue and 32,000 employees globally, Fyffes said.Wikipedia says Chiquita is 
the final name in a long list of companies whose ultimate origin was the United 
Fruit Company, formed in 1899 by the merging of the Boston Fruit 
Company and various fruit exporting concerns controlled by Minor C. Keith. In 
1970 it became the United Brands Company when it was purchased by Eli Black. He 
outbid two other conglomerates, Zapata Corporation and Textron, for a 
controlling interest in the company. In fact, that is a condensed version of 
what has actually happened to United Fruit Co., famed in the U.S. for Chiquita 
bananas, but known to generations of Latin Americans as ""el Pulpo"" (the 
Octopus). In 1990 the company became Chiquita Brands International.The original “Banana 
Republic” was Honduras: United Fruit Company had many banana plantations, 
practically controlled the country economically and got involved in politics as 
well. Since the term was coined, the word has grown to be applied to any country 
with unstable, non-democratic governments, and abundant foreign influence, 
especially in economics. The many countries in Latin America that were dominated 
by United Fruit Company (UFCo) in the first half of the 20th century certainly 
fit that definition.The New York Times

wrote in 2008: [Today, “the banana is the world’s fourth major food, 
after rice, wheat and milk.” But when a Brooklyn-born twentysomething named 
Minor Keith planted a few banana cuttings next to a railroad track in Costa Rica 
in the early 1870s, it was virtually unknown outside its native environs. Keith 
and his partners soon realized how great the potential profits were — especially 
if, along with growing bananas, they could control railroads, shipping and 
Central American governments (to that end, Keith married the beautiful daughter 
of a Costa Rican president). Only then did they set out to turn the banana into 
a product for the masses. Until its demise a hundred years later, United Fruit 
controlled as much as 90% of the market.]Fyffes Announces merger with Chiquita, FY13 numbers in-line: Patrick Higgins 
of Goodbody comments - - ""Fyffes announced this morning that it will combine 
with Chiquita in a stock for stock  transaction. This will result in Fyffes shareholders holding 49.3% of the new 
entity,  ChiquitaFyffes plc. The group will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and 
domiciled in  Ireland. The merger will create the largest player globally, with c.14% market 
share. The  transaction values Fyffes at €1.22, a 38% premium to current levels.The new company will have an equity value of c. $1.1bn and net debt of $576m. 
Combined  EBITDA is $174m, with an additional $40m expected in synergies. Another synergy 
benefit  from the transaction is on the balance sheet. Chiquita was highly leveraged at 
4.7x EBITDA,  the new entity will have a more manageable net debt / EBITDA of 2.7x. Fyffes 
management  will have governance of the new entity also, with David McCann to be appointed 
the new  CEO, Tom Murphy the new CFO and Coen Boss the new COO.Fyffes reported FY13 results this morning with EPS in-line with our forecasts 
at 8.8c, +3.1%  yoy. Sales came in at €839m, +7% , while adjusted EBITA was €32.7m (vs Goodbody
 €31.9m), at the top end of the guidance range of €29-€34m.   Banana sales were up in the year as the group continued to grow volumes; however 
profits  were down slightly due primarily to higher fruit costs. Pricing was weak in H1 
although a  significant pick up occurred during the summer months due a tightening of 
supply. Overall  pricing increased but insufficiently to offset the continuing rise in fruit 
costs.Melons, which is predominantly H1 weighted, performed strongly as the group 
continues to  grow its market share in the key import season in the US. Profits in Fyffes 
pineapple  business rose strongly benefitting from an improvement in market conditions and 
stability in  supply volumes, particularly in H1.Current trading has been satisfactory in the year to date, although pricing 
is behind  year on year. As a result and given the potential for volatility in the core 
banana  business over the course of the year, management has set a wide initial guidance
 range for adjusted EBITA of €30-35m (vs. Goodbody forecasts for €33.7m). At 
first  glance, we are unlikely to change our forecasts.""The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) 
announced that it will hold a 
bond auction on Thursday, 13 March, the first such auction since 21 September 
2010.

			
			Speaking today, John Corrigan, NTMA chief executive said: “The resumption 
of scheduled bond auctions builds on the phased re-entry to the capital markets 
achieved by the NTMA over the past two years and marks the full normalisation of 
Ireland’s presence in the markets.”

			
			The details of the bond auction on 13 March are as follows:

			
			Bond to be auctioned: 
3.40% Treasury Bond 2024

			
			Auction size: 
€1bn

			
			The auction will be conducted on the Bloomberg Auction System and will be 
confined to recognised primary dealers.Escher Group FY13 results statement highlights positive pipeline: 
Rachael of 
Goodbody comments - - ""Escher Group has announced FY13 results this morning. 
Revenue of $24.7m had already  been reported in the group’s trading statement in January while adjusted EBITDA 
came in at  $4.2m (company definition), 5% ahead of the $4m guidance given in January. Adj. 
EPS  came in at 4.8c versus our 5.6c forecast with a higher interest and tax charges 
the key  differences.License revenue was $5.1m, -19% yoy, and -5% versus our forecast. The 
statement notes  that the yoy performance was impacted by the fact that the group received 
licence revenue  from Malaysia in the prior year but this was somewhat offset by the extension of 
the number  of licences in the Saudi Post contract and ongoing payments received from USPS. 
In  addition, this revenue was held back by the delay of the USPS licence fee in 
2013. The group  remains confident of recognising this revenue in H114 (c. $6m). Maintenance 
revenue was  $5.4m, +6% yoy, driven by the full year impact of customers signed in 2012. 
Support  revenue was -11% yoy to $2.5m, which reflected a contract renewal done during 
the year.  In terms of services revenue, it was +35% yoy to $11.6m, versus our $10.3m 
forecast,  driven by the group's work with the USPS and the Malaysian post office. Gross 
profit margin  (61% v 66% in 2012) was impacted by the revenue mix which was more weighted 
towards  the lower margin services revenue during the year.On current trading and outlook, for the Riposte division (postal software) 
the statement  notes that the group has been in contact with several postal organisations and 
is confident of  signing new customers in 2014. Within Escher Interactive Services (digital mail 
and mobile  wallet solutions), it notes that the pipeline of opportunities has expanded 
significantly over  the last 12 months and Escher remains confident about the prospects for 2014.Overall, we are unlikely to make any significant changes to FY14 forecasts
 following this morning’s announcement. It is encouraging to see the group note 
the  pipeline of potential deals for both of its divisions. While we have c.3 wins in 
our  forecasts per annum for its postal software division already, further traction 
in its  interactive services division could see upside to group forecasts and our price
 target.Banks: SME survey indicates uptick in loan refusal rate; 
Eamonn Hughes and 
Colm Foley comment - - ""The latest Quarterly Bank Watch Survey at the end of 
February by ISME, the small and  medium sized enterprises association, has shown that refusal rates by banks to 
lend to small  businesses rose by 4 points to 54%. The survey of 924 owner-managers of SMEs 
also found  that 60% of respondents had increased of bank charges imposed on them whilst 18% 
had  incurred increased interest rates.The uptick in refusals comes against the background of the improving economy 
and the  previous quarterly survey which reported an improving refusal rate from 58% to 
50%.  Indeed, credit standards in the most recent Central Bank input to the EU Bank 
Lending  Survey highlighted unchanged credit standards for the SME sector in Q413 whilst 
there was  an expectation that standards in Q114 would also be unchanged.The quick reversal in the refusal rate is surprising and something we’ll need 
to  monitor, but ongoing evidence of an improving economy highlights that, on  balance, conditions for the SME sector should be showing some signs of  improvement. Evidence of higher charges is also likely to flow through to better
 income for the banks in due course.Economic View: GDP data likely to confirm investment-led recovery; Dermot 
O'Leary of Goodbody comments - - ""Positive momentum in the Irish economy is 
expected to be confirmed by this week’s Q4 2013  GDP data. A key feature of recent quarters, and indeed of our forecasts for the 
coming years,  is that a rebound in investment is leading recovery in domestic demand. This 
should be a  feature of the Q4 2013 data.For 2013 as a whole, we are forecasting that GDP grew by 0.4%, following a 
0.2% expansion  in 2012. On first glance, therefore, describing Ireland as a “growth beacon” 
would be very  much an exaggeration. However, the “patent cliff” in the pharmaceutical sector 
has played a  significant role in depressing GDP growth over that period; we estimate 1.0% to 
1.5%. More  encouraging is the trend in domestic demand. In Q3 2013, domestic demand, 
excluding the  volatile aircraft component, grew by 1.6%, its fastest rate of growth since 
2007. Within this,  investment grew by 8% yoy, with contributions from both business machinery and
 equipment and construction. Surveys over recent months suggest that trends in 
the former  continued, while momentum in the construction sector has also been maintained 
(confirmed  by this morning’s PMI). After falling for the first three quarters of the year, 
we expect  consumer spending to make a small contribution to growth in Q4.Another key aspect of the GDP data that we will be watching closely is the 
nominal  data, as they will act as an input into the deficit and debt to GDP 
calculations. News  on this front has been slightly disappointing of late, owing to very low 
inflationary  pressures. The key theme of the data though should be one of an improving, and
 indeed better quality, economic recovery.Irish and European industry continues to recover in 2014: Conall Mac Coille 
of Davy comments - - ""European stock indices fell on Friday: the Euro Stoxx 50 
fell 1.6% and the S&P500 rose 0.1%. On-going tensions over Crimea held back risk 
appetite despite better-than- expected US non-farm payrolls at 175,000. US 
Treasury yields jumped on the news to above 2.8% from 2.72%. The euro rose to a 
fresh high against the dollar, breaking through $1.39 in early trade, as 
investors weighed the ECB’s decision to keep rates on hold.German industrial production grew by 5.0% in the year to January 2014, well 
above expectations. French data released this morning show manufacturing up 1.4% 
on the year. Italian figures will be released at 09.00 this morning. Given the 
strength of euro area manufacturing PMI surveys (53.2 in February) and the hard 
data on output, the consensus forecast for just 1.9% euro area industrial 
production growth in 2014 looks overly pessimistic.In this context, Friday’s industrial production data for Ireland provided 
further evidence that the sector is benefitting from the improving cycle in 
Europe. Irish industrial production fell by 1.1% in the year to January but was 
split between a 5.3% fall in the modern sector and a 7.8% rise in traditional 
manufacturing.Output in the labour-intensive traditional sector (accounting for two-thirds, 
or 137,100, of total industrial sector employment of 200,000), is gradually 
recovering, broadly in tandem with the broader European sector. In contrast, the 
pharmaceutical sector has been hurt by the patent cliff. However, pharmaceutical 
companies employ just 40,000 and have responded to the patent cliff by 
increasing investment in plant and R&D to bring the next generation of drugs to 
market. So, even within the pharmaceutical sector, there has been no evidence of 
aggregate job cuts.Separately, new cars licensed in February were up 23% on 2013 levels and new 
goods vehicles licensed were up by 45%. This provides further evidence that the 
rebound in Irish consumer and business confidence has led households and 
companies to increase their spending. Indeed, the surge in Irish consumer 
confidence through H2 2013 was accompanied by a pick-up in surveys on 
households’ intentions to spend on big ticket items such as cars.""

669	U.S. banana producer Chiquita Brands International and Ireland's Fyffes have agreed to merge and create the world's largest banana company.The combined company, to be known as ChiquitaFyffes, is set to displace privately-held Dole from the No. 1 spot.The United Nations reports that Chiquita once had a clear lead on banana sales, with more than a third of the global market in the 1960s. But by the end of the 1990s, Dole had caught it in global market share.According to BananaLink, a public interest group, Dole today has about a 26% market share; Chiquita has 22%; Fresh Del Monte Produce has 15% and Fyffes has 7%. That means the top three companies will have 70% of the global market if the deal is allowed to go through.The combined company will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but will have its legal headquarters in Ireland. That is likely to provide tax savings for the company. U.S. drugmaker Perrigo achieved just that benefit last year with its relocation after its purchase of Irish drugmaker Elan.Chitiqua current shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each of their shares, while Fyffes shareholders will receive a fraction of a share for each of their shares, which will represent a 38% premium for their current holdings.Shares of Fyffes were up more than 30% in trading in London early Monday, while shares of Chiquita were up nearly 12%.Current holders of Chiquita stock will hold a slight majority of shares in the combined company, which is estimated to have a market value just over $1 billion.The deal needs the approval of a majority of Chiquita shareholders and 75% of Fyffes shareholders and could also be subject to review by U.S. and European regulators.Type your comment here:Sign up now for our daily and weekly e-newsletters!

By David Elliott

March 10 2014

Dublin-based fruit supplier Fyffes is to merge with US-based rival Chiquita in a deal creating the world's largest banana company.
The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of $4.6bn (€3.31bn) from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples. Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of $3bn and 20,000 staff. Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7pc of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at $526m. The existing brands will be retained but customers will have access to a more diverse product mix and choice, the two companies said. Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged business, said: ""Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth. ""We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers."" Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co. The world's oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia. It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland.

              Chiquita of the U.S. has merged with the Dublin-based company Fyffes ro create the world's largest banana company. (Amy Sancetta/Associated Press)            Chiquita has combined with Dublin-based Fyffes to become the world's top banana company.The stock-for-stock transaction announced Monday creates a global banana and fresh produce company with $4.6 billion  US in annual sales. The merged company, ChiquitaFyffes PLC, will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.The companies said the deal, which still requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of the combined operation.The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66 US).Fyffes rose 46 per cent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 per cent to $12.20 in New York.Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.Fyffes chairman David McCann will become chief executive officer of the combined company while the chief executive of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.Lonergan said their ""natural strategic partnership"" would ""provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.""However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita, which has a big presence in the or Fyffes, a major presence in Europe, aren't expected to notice any difference. The two brands are staying separate.

Top banana as Fyffes and Chiquita mergeShare this articleThe world’s biggest banana company looks set to be created following the proposed merger of Irish fruit firm Fyffes and US rival Chiquita.The estimated value of the new Chiquita-Fyffes is some 1.0 billion US dollars.Shareholders are to get shares in both firms with Fyffes’ holding some 49.3 percent.Reuters Breakingviews columnist Robert Cole said bananas are a serious subject: “Yes I mean we smile about it, but it’s been a really hot business/political topic for years and years and years. There are small countries in the West Indies and other places, which depend on bananas. So having a global, very powerful company really might not suit some of the competition authorities.” The new company is expected to process some 180 million boxes of bananas, outstripping all other competitors.The merger will be subject to review by competition regulators. However, as the fruit firms operate in separate European and North American markets the deal is expected to go through.Share this article

  Hampshire tropical fruit importer Fyffes is to merge with US-based rival Chiquita in a deal creating the world's largest banana company.

  The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of 4.6 billion US dollars (£2.75 billion) from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

  Dublin-based Fyffes, which imports banas through Portsmouth, also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of 3 billion US dollars (£1.8 billion) and 20,000 staff.

  It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including in Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

  Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at 526 million US dollars (£314.5 million).

  The existing brands will be retained but customers will have access to a more diverse product mix and choice, the two companies said.

  Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged business, said: ''Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

  ''We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.''

  Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

  The world's oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

697	  U.S. fruit distributor Chiquita Brands International Inc is to buy Irish rival Fyffes Plc in an all-stock deal valued at $526 million to create the world's biggest banana supplier.  The transaction will create a fresh produce company worth about $4.6 billion in annual revenues and it is expected to generate operational pre-tax savings of at least $40 million by the end of 2016.   Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the combined company, ChiquitaFyffes, while Fyffes shareholders will have the remaining 49.3 percent, the companies said in a statement on Monday.    The New York-listed combined company will have tax savings from being domiciled in Ireland, similar to U.S. drugmaker Perrigo's acquisition of Elan last year.    Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38 percent over its Friday's closing price.    Fyffes shares jumped 29 percent to 1.15 euros by 0710 GMT.    The deal could raise antitrust issues, given that more than 80 percent of the global banana market is controlled by four multinationals - Chiquita, Fyffes, Fresh Del Monte and Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company - according to the United Nations.   Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as financial advisers for Chiquita and its board andLazard for Fyffes.   	Business

Dublin-based fruit supplier Fyffes is to merge with US-based rival Chiquita in a deal creating the world's largest banana company.
The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of $4.6bn (€3.31bn) from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of $3bn and 20,000 staff.Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7pc of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at $526m.The existing brands will be retained but customers will have access to a more diverse product mix and choice, the two companies said.Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged business, said: ""Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.""We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.""Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.The world's oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland.

706	3 Min ReadSYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian markets were set for another tense session on Tuesday as worries about China’s economy continue to reverberate, taking a particularly hard toll on commodity prices. February’s shock fall in exports from the Asian behemoth has cast a shadow over the global outlook, even as analysts blamed much of the drop on the Lunar New Year holidays. Oil and industrial commodities bore the brunt of the sell-off. Copper futures shed almost 2 percent on Monday, while spot prices for iron ore .IO62-CNI=SI tumbled over 8 percent. Brent crude lost 92 cents to $108.08, while U.S. oil extended its decline to $100.94 a barrel. Investors will be nervously watching Chinese money markets and the yuan for any evidence the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is engineering an easing in monetary conditions after it forced the currency sharply lower on Monday. <TOP/CEN> Tensions between Russia and Ukraine added to investor unease. In Crimea, unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post. Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis. <TOP/NEWS> Yet, after an initial spill, Wall Street did manage to pare losses. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended off 0.21 percent, while the S&P; 500 .SPX lost just 0.05 percent. That resilience might help steady nerves in Asia, and it was notable that Nikkei futures were only down slightly. In early trade, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was holding steady, after shedding 1.3 percent on Monday. Other popular indicators of risk were also muted. The stock market’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, ended little changed after an early spike, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased a single basis point to 2.78 percent. Forex markets were surprisingly calm with the U.S. dollar barely changed against a basket of major currencies .DXY. Even currencies from major resource exporters incurred only modest losses. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for Chinese risk, came off half a U.S. cent but found solid support around $0.9025. The euro held steady at $1.3876, as was the dollar at 103.26 yen. Later on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan is expected to reaffirm its commitment to massive monetary stimulus. Nothing new is expected at the policy meeting, but markets suspect the BOJ could be pushed into action once a sales tax increase goes through in April. The Japanese economy grew at a pedestrian 0.7 percent annualized pace in the last quarter of 2013 as net exports proved a major drag, intensifying pressure for fresh action form the central bank. The BOJ’s decision is due anytime after 0300 GMT, and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference afterward. Editing by John MairAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

709	Reuters Staff6 Min Read* Decline in Chinese exports weighs on commodity currencies * Copper hits eight-month low * Mining stocks hit by Chinese trade data * Tensions between Russia and Ukraine added to investor concern By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - Global stock indexes slipped and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1 percent from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide. The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report. “The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York. Prices on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78 percent. The Chinese data also provided some support to gold. Chinese gloom added to strain in emerging markets, compounding worries the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money. The data hit commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars , both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the exports plunge. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine added to investor unease. In Crimea, unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula. Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis. In the U.S. stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average  fell 34.04 points or 0.21 percent, to 16,418.68, the S&P; 500 lost 0.87 points or 0.05 percent, to 1,877.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.775 points or 0.04 percent, to 4,334.448. Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.5 percent to $31.38 as the China data sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P; materials index lost 0.1 percent. European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5 percent, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index  was down 0.4 percent and an emerging market stock index was down 1.2 percent. German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3 percent, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in the world’s top commodity buyer. “Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne. On Wall Street, Boeing Co shares lost 1.3 percent to $126.89 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P; 500, after the plane maker said late Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday. Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 1.3 percent at $23.09. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice president, global communications and investor relations. The Aussie last traded 0.6 percent weaker at $0.9017 , while the loonie bounced back at C$1.1101 after hitting a low of C$1.1073 in Asian trading. The Australian dollar had been tracking higher towards the end of last week, boosted by signs of improvement in its own economy. But like fellow commodity producer Canada, it depends heavily on China extending a decade of robust expansion. Authorities in Beijing continued a campaign to halt any further appreciation of the yuan by setting its daily guidance for the currency at the highest since mid-December. The U.S. dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that U.S. job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was up 0.06 percent at 79.767. In the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25 and within a hair of nearly three-year lows. Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels. The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude  fell 92 cents to settle at $108.08. U.S. oil dropped $1.246 to $101.12 a barrel. Gold prices were little changed, though disappointing data helped underpin the market. Spot gold inched down 5 cents to $1,339.80 an ounce. Chinese gold prices were trading at a discount of $5-$6 an ounce to spot prices, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of more than $20 at the beginning of the year.

712	"BUSINESS SPECTATORChina's central bank weakened the daily reference rate for its currency by the largest percentage in more than a year and a half, continuing a push to drive the yuan lower. As sluggish economic news sent jitters through the market, the People's Bank of China set the daily reference rate Monday at 6.1312 to the US dollar, compared with 6.1201 to the US dollar on Friday. The 0.18 per cent change represented the largest one-day move in the rate since July 2012. The central bank determines the rate each day, and then allows the currency to trade as much as 1 per cent higher or lower. Since 2005, it has gradually moved the rate up, allowing the yuan to strengthen 33 per cent, but in the last month has pushed it lower, seeking to discourage speculators who have channeled money into the economy in hopes of benefiting from the currency's rise. The US dollar-Chinese yuan pair was fixed ""much higher than what the market environment would have otherwise suggested,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a senior currency strategist at Scotiabank in Hong Kong. This suggests, he said, that the yuan is heading back to weaker levels it hit against the greenback a few weeks ago. Mr Tihanyi says the move to set the yuan weaker isn't a reaction by policy makers to news Saturday that China recorded a rare trade deficit in February, but is an element of a broader effort by the central bank to overhaul the financial system. Beijing is seeking to make it clear to investors that the yuan isn't a one-way bet, laying the groundwork for allowing the currency to trade more freely. Premier Li Keqiang said last week at the National People's Congress, China's annual legislative session, that Beijing would expand the currency-trading band. The trade figures, as well as disappointing news about inflation released over the weekend, weren't surprising and reflect seasonal factors, analysts and strategists said. Exports plummeted, leaving the world's second-largest economy with a $US22.9 billion ($A25.2bn) monthly trade deficit, its first since early last year. Imports, however, were up 10.1 per cent from a year earlier, pointing to undamaged Chinese demand. ""We aren't surprised by the trade deficit in February, as China used to record a deficit in February or March in recent years and we don't think there is a big chance China will post a deficit again in March,"" said Huang Yi, head of currencies and commodities of China Guangfa Bank. Mr Huang said that while the deficit has changed some investors' and institutions' short-term expectations, the selloff in the yuan wasn't overwhelming. The ""two-way"" movement will persist in the short run, he said. Analysts note that volatility in the currency has risen dramatically over the past few weeks from record lows, after the yuan spooked market participants with an unexpected 1.3 per cent tumble in late February and early March. The yuan usually barely budges; it gained 2.9 per cent in all of 2013. On Monday, the yuan touched 6.1458 against the dollar, compared with 6.1260 late Friday in New York. The offshore yuan, which is freely traded outside China, fell as low as 6.1309 from 6.1095 on Friday. Some say while the weekend's economic news was a factor behind the decision to change the reference rate, Chinese policy makers have taken the news as an opportunity to prompt caution in the market and shake out speculators who have driven money into China. ""We expect that the trade figures will be more real in the coming months as the [yuan] has become much more volatile and less predictable than before,"" economists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. wrote in a note on March 8. The gap, or spread, between interest rates in the onshore and offshore markets is narrowing, potentially deterring people from pumping money into mainland China to take advantage of high yields in the onshore market, they said. The forum will focus on beyond China – Australia’s food opportunity in Southeast Asia, the rise of the home delivery business and Amazon Fresh, animal welfare and the growing importance of social licence to operate in agriculture and the science of food and GMO versus organic food.Tuesday March 27, 2018The Westin Sydney

While you were sleeping: China hits stocks, copper
March 11 (BusinessDesk) – Stocks and commodities including copper and iron ore fell after a surprise drop in China’s exports bolstered concern about the slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
China’s exports sank 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, according to General Administration of Customs data on the weekend. As a result, copper futures for May delivery shed 1.5 percent to US$3.0355 a pound in afternoon trading on the Comex in New York, extending Friday’s slide of about 4 percent.
In afternoon trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.35 percent, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.14 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.13 percent lower.
“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” IPR Capital director Steven Mayne told Reuters.
Slides in shares of Boeing, last down 2.3 percent, and those of Verizon, last down 0.9 percent, led declines in the Dow.
Boeing was dragged lower after saying it would inspect wings for cracks on undelivered 787s, and after a 777 flown by Malaysian Airline System disappeared over the ocean three days ago.
“News of the wing and inspections likely lower first quarter deliveries, plus the 777 aircraft incident in Asia will likely weigh on the Boeing stock this week,” Peter Arment, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach, told Bloomberg News.
In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.5 percent drop from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX gave up 0.9 percent. France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent.
Concern about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine keeps weighing on markets worldwide.
Meanwhile, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser reiterated his concern that the US economy might be stronger than policy makers anticipate and suggested the Fed should accelerate the tapering of its monthly bond-buying programme.
On Friday, a report showed American employers added a higher-than-expected 175,000 jobs, while January’s jobs gain was revised up. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, from 6.6 percent.
“I expect that the unemployment rate will reach about 6.2 percent by the end of 2014, and, if anything, that may prove too pessimistic,” Plosser said in a speech in Paris. “Given the recent trends, an unemployment rate below 6 percent is certainly plausible.”
“Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts,” Plosser said.

715	Reuters Staff5 Min Read* Decline in Chinese exports drives down commodity currencies * Copper hits eight-month low * Mining stocks hit by Chinese trade data By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - World stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1 percent from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide. The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report. China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money. “The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York. Prices on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78 percent. The commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars   declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.26 points or 0.43 percent, to 16,382.46, the S&P; 500  lost 5.11 points or 0.27 percent, to 1,872.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.229 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,324.994. Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.3 percent to $31.14 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P; materials index  lost 0.6 percent. European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5 percent, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index  was down 0.6 percent and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3 percent. German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3 percent, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in China, the world’s top commodity buyer. “Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne. Despite weakness in Asian markets, a sense of relief in Europe that tensions between Russia and the West over Crimea had not escalated buoyed shares in early trading, though there was no escape from the undercurrent of unease. On Wall Street, Boeing Co shares lost 2.5 percent to $125.31 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P; 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday. Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 2 percent at $22.92. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice president, global communications and investor relations. The Aussie traded 0.4 percent lower at $0.9031, while the loonie was down 0.2 percent at $1.1104. “The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” said Alvin Tann, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London. The yuan earlier fell as much as 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth. The U.S. dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that U.S. job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was little changed at 79.743. In the metals markets, London copper hit an eight-month low. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded down 1.36 percent to $6,690 a tonne. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest level since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows. Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels. The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude  was trading 97 cents down at $108.03. U.S. oil fell $1.33 to $101.25 a barrel. All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2018 Reuters. All Rights Reserved.	Business

718	March 10, 20147:29 AM EDTLONDON — World stocks edged off a six-year peak and commodities from copper to crude oil tumbled on Monday as surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors already on edge over the crisis in Ukraine.Despite weakness in Asian markets, a sense of relief in Europe that tensions between Russia and the West over Crimea had not escalated buoyed shares in early trading, though there was no escape from the undercurrent of unease.European shares faded through the morning and were back in the red as U.S. trading loomed, and the continued weakness in the DAX and big German firms that sell to Russia offset gains by Portuguese, Italian and Spanish stocks.Merger activity in France helped the CAC 40, but mining firms sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials weighed on London’s FTSE 100 as commodities and related currencies lost altitude.“People sold on Friday on fear of an escalation in Crimea, but things seem to have stabilized now so it’s tempting to buy the dip,” said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris.China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18% year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy.It put an immediate dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report.China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest in nearly nine months, copper – of which China is the biggest consumer — hit an eight-month low, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars also suffered.For emerging markets Chinese gloom added more strain, compounding worries over the U.S. turning off the taps on the cheap money that has been flowing to them.Emerging stocks fell 1% and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan posted its biggest fall in more than a month as it lost 1.4%. Tokyo’s Nikkei shed 1% as Japanese GDP figures also disappointed.UKRAINEWall Street was expected to dip about 0.2% when trading resumes. The S&P 500 hit its latest all-time high on Friday, underscoring how recent market jitters have driven investors back into more predictable economies.Part of the attraction is that central banks such as the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England have promised to keep interest rates down for as long as they can.There was a shot across the bows for that tactic over the weekend, however, from the central bank of central banks, the Bank of International Settlements, warning it raised “the risk of an unhealthy accumulation of financial imbalances”.China’s export woes also cast a cloud over currency markets.The yuan fell as much as 0.5% and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.The Australian and Canadian dollars, which are highly sensitive to China’s fortunes, lost as much as half a percent, while the dollar and Russia’s rouble were both steady amid the lull in Ukraine.The euro was steady at $1.3882 after hitting a 2-1/2 year high peak on Friday. Rate cut bets have been significantly scaled back since the ECB suggested last week that the eurozone recovery was on track.Focus was turning to a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday in Brussels over plans to wind down troubled banks. It will comes alongside more details on the ECB’s stress tests of the banking sector.COPPER SUFFERSGold edged lower for a second straight session after the strong U.S. jobs data on Friday eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal’s safe-haven appeal.However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a crucial factor. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week to their highest in more than a year.The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude oil down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains.The biggest blow came in copper, however, as it hit an eight-month low of $6,608 a tonne and Shanghai contracts dropped by the 5% daily limit. As well as the weak export data, there were also fears about copper finance deals after China’s first domestic bond default last week.“Clearly there’s an unwind of positioning in the credit markets in China, and as a result of that, copper which was being held as collateral against that credit is no longer required,” Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at Marex Spectron, said.© Thomson Reuters 2014This content was provided by Market One for commercial purposes.

723	Stock markets in the Chinese mainland tumbled on Monday as investors absorbed weak economic data and news of the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines plane. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index plunged below the 2,000 level, falling by 58.84 points or 2.86 percent to 1,999.07 points on Monday. The Shenzhen Component Index tumbled to its lowest closing level in five years, falling by 210.04 points or 2.87 percent to 7,118.44 points. Combined turnover on the two bourses on Monday was 219.63 billion yuan ($35.76 billion), up slightly from Friday's 215.84 billion yuan.A series of releases of disappointing data over the weekend worried market watchers, adding to the slowing factory activity data and fall in real estate transactions last week. China's consumer price index (CPI) fell to a 13-month low of 2 percent in February, according to data released Sunday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Analysts saw the dip in the consumer price index as a sign of weakening consumer demand and continuing difficulties for enterprises. The NBS data also showed an unexpected fall of 18.1 percent in China's exports in February, resulting in a trade deficit of $22.98 billion. The yuan saw a sharp drop against the US dollar on Monday, falling by 111 basis points to 6.1312 yuan to the dollar, its weakest level this year.Financial stocks underperformed on Monday, with the banking sector falling by 2.79 percent and brokerages sliding by 3.29 percent. Shares linked to wearable media devices also retreated on Monday. The disappearance on Saturday of a Beijing-bound flight from Malaysia weighed on the airline, tourism and insurance sectors on Monday.  Air China Ltd declined by 4.95 percent to 3.46 yuan while China Eastern Corp slumped by 3.56 percent to 2.44 yuan. ChiNext, China's NASDAQ-style board for high-tech and fast-growing start-ups listed in Shenzhen, saw a big fall of 53.54 points or 3.67 percent to 1,407.07 points on Monday.  Nearly 90 percent of the stocks listed on ChiNext declined, with 14 stocks falling by the daily limit of 10 percent.

 On Friday, Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. failed to make an 89.8 million yuan ($14.7 million) interest payment, the first domestic corporate bond default in the history of the People’s Republic of China. The company, in the red for three straight years, narrowly avoided missing an interest payment on its five-year, billion yuan obligation in January 2013.  Then, the Shanghai municipality leaned on banks to not press claims on overdue loans so that Chaori could pay bondholders.This time, Shanghai officials sat on their hands after the company issued a warning on Tuesday that it was able to pay only a small portion—less than five percent—of the interest coming due.  Even more remarkably, authorities let Chaori default during the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, a particularly sensitive moment in the Chinese political calendar.Analysts correctly praised Beijing for not rescuing the solar panel company.  After all, the missed payment for the first time introduced the concept of risk in the $1.4 trillion corporate bond market, where investors were blindly chasing offerings with the highest coupons regardless of the creditworthiness of issuers.
Central government technocrats were smart to pick a marginal issuer for the first failure, yet there is nonetheless cause for concern.  

Bank of America
 Merrill Lynch, in aresearch note issued on the Wednesday after the company’s warning, called the then-potential default China’s “Bear Stearns moment.”That assessment angered Xinhua News Agency.  “Indeed,” the official Chinese organ noted in a commentary, “it is hard to grasp how a potential default of the bond—163 million U.S. dollars in principal and rated as junk by Shenzhen-based Pengyuan Credit—could be likened to the systemically important investment bank Bear Stearns with hundreds of billions of dollars on its balance sheet at the time.”Clearly, Chaori is not Bear Stearns, but what the Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists were referring to was the July 2007 disclosure of problems at two Bear Stearns subprime hedge funds.  That event is considered to have ignited a burn that eventually triggered the global panic the following year.  As the strategists noted, “We doubt that the financial system in China will experience a liquidity crunch immediately because of this default but we think the chain reaction will probably start.”Will it?  Most observers think not.  “Though China’s financial system faces many serious challenges, the government has far greater power to prevent a disorderly collapse than its Western counterparts did,” notes Reuters’s Peter Thal Larsen, writing on the Dealbook site of the New York Times.  “If fears of a Bear Stearns moment have any value, it is to serve as a reminder to the Chinese authorities which mistakes they must avoid at all costs.”Yes, Chinese authorities have the benefit of hindsight, but they face an almost-impossible situation.  Even if they make every decision correctly, they will, in all probability, be the victim of what Philip Li of China Chengxin International Credit Rating last week called “a domino effect.”Consider the challenges.  It is no secret why Chaori defaulted.  The solar industry in China is notorious for overcapacity and weak prices.  The country, of course, is littered with Chaoris, but solar panel overproduction is just the beginning of the story.  In the “green” sector, you will find excess wind turbine factories, for instance.  And there are far too many coal mines, steel mills, smelters, and ship yards.  Need glass or cement?  China is certainly the place to go to hook up with an idle producer.  Gross overproduction helps explain why the producer price index, which measures factory gate prices, fell in February for the 24th consecutive month. Up to now, Beijing has been able to bail out loss-making industries, but that has to change because the economy is slowing fast.  The manufacturing sector, measured by the HSBC purchasing managers’ index, contracted in both January and February.  In the first two months of this year—aggregated for statistical purposes to eliminate the distortion caused by the Lunar New Year holiday—exports fell 1.6% over the same period in 2013.  The number of urban job openings, as evidenced by surveys announced by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, fell both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter in the third and fourth quarters of last year.  Tellingly, city jobs in Q4 fell a stunning 13.7% from the preceding quarter.If the economy continues to erode, there must be a series of defaults.  Expect troubles soon, especially in the second half of this year.  Haitong Securities, China’s second-largest brokerage, estimates that 5.3 trillion yuan of trust products will come due this year.Businesses could have an especially hard time rolling over obligations.  Chaori, as small and unimportant as it is, appears to be already affecting China’s credit markets.  In the last few days, four debt issuers postponed offerings, and at last count at least 6.6 billion yuan of domestic bond sales have been delayed.  One of the disappointed companies, Suining Chuanzhong Economic Technology Development, blamed Chaori, saying it had “triggered severe upheaval in the bond market.”  Observers think high-yield issuers will soon be paying 200 basis points more for money.“In the U.S., it took about a year to reach the Lehman stage when the market panicked and the shadow banking sector froze,” the Bank of America Merrill Lynch note pointed out last week.  “It may take less time in China as the market is less transparent.” In any event, there is now too much debt for Beijing to handle.  Since the end of 2007, the amount of corporate bonds has risen more than 10 times.  Assets in trusts—most of them risky—skyrocketed 46% last year.  Even though China’s economy, if properly reported, is about half that of the U.S., the amount of Chinese corporate debt could overtake America’s this year.China, in recent years, has created too much indebtedness too fast.  Chaori’s default on Friday is a warning of what will inevitably occur next.Follow me on Twitter @GordonGChang and on Forbes"	Business

There is a sharp difference between strong imports of copper and China's moderating PMI over the past three months.""This divergence is explained by trading companies importing copper (and some other commodities such as iron ore and coal) using letters of credit (LCs) issued by onshore banks.""""The commodities may then be sold in the domestic market (with the proceeds lent in the informal credit markets) or used as collateral to borrow more bank funding,"" Standard Chartered added.Barclays Capital said in a note to clients: ""We expect the China's trade balance to turn positive in the coming months although the monthly surplus will come down from the average of $30bn in Q4 2013 (Jan-Feb: 4.4bn, Q1 2013: 14bn), as 'hot money' inflows disguised in the trade flows being are squeezed out.""Overall, we expect continued trade and current account surplus and net inflows under the capital account with the latter being controlled by the PBoC with its capital account opening measures. We believe this should support a modest appreciation of the CNY against the USD although at a slower pace than the 2.8% in 2013.""Standard Chartered said in a separate note: ""We maintain our China's GDP growth forecast for 2014 unchanged at 7.4%.

“Given how share prices have corrected and given where the valuations are, from a risk-reward standpoint we still think we can make a positive case on Chinese equities,” Kinger Lau, a strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview in Hong Kong on March 4. He predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index will climb to 12,000 in the next 12 months, a 24 percent advance from last week’s close, versus the brokerage’s December forecast for the measure to reach 13,600 by the end of 2014.The index of Chinese shares in Hong Kong lost 10 percent this year through last week, the most among 93 global benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg, as factory gauges pointed to a slowdown in the economy and concern grew that more companies will struggle to repay debt after the nation’s first onshore corporate bond default on March 7. The gauge trades at a 45 percent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index, the most in a decade.China’s leaders are trying to balance clampdowns on the shadow-banking industry and local-government debt with measures to support growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. became the first company to default in China after failing to pay full interest due last week on onshore bonds.Relative ValueThe Hang Seng China index is valued at 1.1 times net assets, the biggest discount since September 2003 to MSCI’s global index, which has a multiple of 2. The H-share measure slid 1.7 percent to 9,540.10 as of 1:41 p.m. in Hong Kong.BlackRock Inc. named Helen Zhu as head of China equities, luring the New York bank’s chief China equity strategist away from Goldman Sachs. The appointment takes effect on April 7 and Zhu may start managing funds later this year, BlackRock said in a statement. The New York-based firm is the world’s largest money manager, overseeing about $4.3 trillion.Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. all trade at about the same level as their net assets, while Bank of China Ltd. has a price-to-book ratio of 0.8. The four lenders are the nation’s biggest by market value.“Any clear and concrete policy measures in terms of dealing with shadow banking loans and local government debt would likely be positive catalysts for banks,” Lau said. “Valuations for Chinese banks have already priced in a very significant crisis scenario.”Regulated BorrowingPremier Li Keqiang told the National People’s Congress last week that China will develop a regulated regional borrowing mechanism, after local-government liabilities surged to 17.9 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) as of June 2013 from 10.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2010. Authorities have also started a cleanup of the $6 trillion shadow-banking industry and identified sectors of the economy in need of consolidation.While Chinese banks’ non-performing loans rose by 28.5 billion yuan in the last quarter of 2013 to 592.1 billion yuan, the highest since September 2008, bad loans only accounted for 1 percent of total lending, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said Feb. 13.Bank valuations currently imply a non-performing loan ratio of about 7 percent, Lau said.Global OutlookAn improving global economic outlook may also be a catalyst for a rally in Chinese shares, Lau said, declining to name specific stocks.The World Bank raised its 2014 growth forecasts for advanced nations in January to 2.2 percent from 2 percent, while cutting its estimates for developing nations to 5.3 percent from 5.6 percent. China is the world’s biggest exporter.China last week retained a target for 7.5 percent growth in 2014 for the $9 trillion economy. Gross domestic product expanded 7.7 percent in 2013, the same pace as in 2012.A purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics dropped to a seven-month low of 48.5, the companies said March 3. A similar gauge from the government with a larger sample size fell to 50.2, the lowest since June, a report showed March 1. Numbers above 50 signal expansion.Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, customs data showed March 8, compared with analysts’ median estimate for a 7.5 percent increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July, according to a statistics bureau report, extending the longest decline since 1999.Share SlumpThe Hang Seng China gauge has tumbled 16 percent since Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, predicted on Dec. 2 that the H-share measure would rally 18 percent by the end of 2014.Goldman Sachs’s forecast formed part of a trade recommendation in which the bank told investors to buy Chinese stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities would lag the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade its fourth top recommendation for 2014.

733	March 10, 20148:57 AM EDTInvestors might be nervous about worrying data out of China this morning, but research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch argues a Chinese financial crisis is unlikely.China’s exports unexpectedly fell 18% in February, which led to a plunge in commodity prices Monday and worries that the country’s economy is struggling more than expected. But Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the risk of a financial crisis in China remains slim.“A big concern in the markets in recent months is that defaults in the Chinese bond market could be an early signal of a much bigger financial crisis,” he said. “However, in our view, China’s experience is different than past financial crises in several key respects.”Mr. Harris points out bond defaults have been “widely anticipated” from struggling companies such as solar-cell maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. and that bonds remain a “modest part of China’s capital markets.”China experienced its first onshore bond market default last week when Shanghai Chaori missed an interest payment on its bonds.“A major crisis would require a string of bad outcomes: first the defaults would have to have big contagion effects and second, government efforts to stem the crisis would have to be ineffective,” Mr. Harris said.The latter part is especially important, because the Chinese government has formidable ammunition to fend off a financial crisis, including the largest foreign reserves in the world.“The Chinese government has both the resources and the will to forcefully intervene if contagion kicks in,” he said. “They have a relatively modest budget deficit and huge foreign exchange reserves. Inflation is contained so that will not constrain policy. And we would expect the Chinese authorities to act forcefully, and set aside moral hazard concerns, if a systemic crisis emerges.”	Business

735	"SYDNEY: Shanghai copper dropped by its 5 percent daily limit on Monday to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country's first domestic bond default last week. China's exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide. This inflamed worries about appetite, as demand from Chinese consumers has yet to regain steam after the new year break. London copper prices slid to within a whisker of nearly three-year lows, after shedding nearly 4 percent on Friday. “Fundamental demand has not resumed to normal levels yet,” said analyst Chunlan Li of minerals consultancy CRU in Beijing. “We are still waiting to see demand resume, maybe after mid-March — there's still a chance it will happen.” The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent to 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne, its lowest since Sept. 2009. Across the board, heavy selling in Shanghai metals contracts spilled into the new week, with ShFE aluminium hitting a 5-year low, ShFE lead a contract low and ShFE zinc sliding to its weakest in more than four months. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange had dropped 1.1 percent to $6,709.25 a tonne by 0256 GMT. It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010. But other LME contracts, many with stronger fundamentals than copper this year, held their ground, slipping to multi-week rather than multi-month or year lows. Reflecting ample supply, copper premiums in Shanghai bond have fallen by $20 to $140-$160 from late January, according to China price provider Shmet. China is the world's top user of copper, accounting for 45 percent of global demand. But much of its imports are used for financing, where shipments are sold on domestic markets to raise funds for investment in higher yielding assets like real estate. Worries these deals could unravel flustered traders on Friday after China recorded its first domestic bond default when loss-making solar equipment producer Chaori Solar missed an interest payment, setting a landmark for market discipline in the world's second-largest economy. The default is widely expected to force a re-pricing of credit risk that could pile pressure on weak borrowers. Industries such as metals and mining, shipbuilding and materials are seen as key sectors with high default risks. Li said that there was a substantial risk that sliding property market values or spreading debt market contagion could force copper financing deals to unravel. “But I think it's not this year. The government is still expecting a stable slowdown, not a sharp slowdown – clearly real estate is heavily relevant to economic growth.” Elsewhere, US job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus. Hedge funds and money managers turned copper markets into a net short in the week to March 4, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday. Also curtailing risk appetite, were worries about escalating tensions in Ukraine. Germany's Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine's constitution.

736	"Illustration: Lu Ting/GTChinese investors marked an important milestone last week when they rejected a bond offer by Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Development Co, one of the nation's leading hotel operators, reflecting their growing understanding of risk in China's young financial markets. Chinese investors often blindly pile into nearly any product offered by the latest hot company, bank, fund manager or Internet firm, falsely believing they are guaranteed big returns on their money.But as several recent cases show, big returns are never guaranteed and sometimes investors can even lose all their money on the riskiest products. More sophisticated Western investors are already well-aware of these risks, and seldom complain when high-yield products sometimes fail to deliver promised returns. Central authorities in China need to accelerate efforts to educate Chinese investors about these risks, both through better disclosures and also by letting financial products occasionally fail to teach buyers that no investment is risk-free.Jin Jiang first announced its plan to raise up to 1.6 billion yuan ($260 million) through a corporate bond issue in June, to help fund its expansion at home and also as it seeks to become China's first major hotel brand to go abroad. In January, the company made a tentative first step outside its home market when it formed a partnership with a local company to enter Indonesia. Jin Jiang received necessary approvals to raise the funds, a relatively large sum for a company of its size and also a relatively risky bet due to its dependence on the volatile hotel market to repay the money. But after conducting a roadshow to test market sentiment, Jin Jiang announced late last week it decided to scrap the offer due to ""economic conditions"" - a veiled way of saying that investors weren't interested in the bonds.In the past, domestic investors almost certainly would have given a company like Jin Jiang as much money as it wanted regardless of the return rate. That willingness was based on the underlying assumption that such bonds were risk-free, because either a State-run parent or local government entity would assist with repayment if the company ever ran into financial difficulties. But rejection of the Jin Jiang bond shows investors increasingly realizing they must be responsible for their own decisions, and that they can't depend on State bailouts when problems emerge.Another group of wealthy private investors ran into similar problems last year when a product sold through Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China's largest commercial bank, defaulted on its promise of high returns. In that case, the product was backed by a Shanxi coal mining company that ultimately failed, resulting in the default. But investors complained that they should have been protected from any risk since ICBC marketed the product.An unnamed third party, almost certainly acting under government orders, ultimately stepped in to repay the debt and end the controversy. But even then the investors - who should have lost everything - weren't satisfied, saying they deserved not only to get their money back but also to receive the promised high rate of return. When such defaults happen in the West, buyers often consider themselves lucky to recoup as little as 10 to 20 percent of their original investment.Just last week, Chinese investors got another lesson in risk when solar panel maker Chaori Solar failed to make an interest payment for a domestic bond, becoming the first-ever such default since Chinese authorities first implemented market reforms 25 years ago. The company is just one of many solar firms facing such difficulty, following a two-year downturn for the sector due to construction of massive overcapacity in China. It's still unclear what will happen in that instance, though so far no government entity has come forward to say it will help cover Chaori's 90 million yuan shortfall.Central authorities should resist any urge to come to Chaori's rescue, and also the pressure it is feeling to placate investors in the ICBC case. It should also encourage widespread publicizing of the two cases to show investors they need to take responsibility for all their decisions, including putting money into the many new Internet investment products now springing up such as Yu'ebao.Regulators should also launch a broader campaign to require better disclosure by issuers of these investment products, which often boast high rates of return and hide the risk potential in the fine print. Such a two-pronged approach will benefit not only investors but also the entire Chinese financial sector by building trust and accountability throughout the system.The author is a former company news reporter from Reuters.

738	"Growth concerns are back and China is to blame for what Barclays Capital said Monday will be a risk-off start to the week.Asian equities were lower across the board, led by Shanghai and Hong Kong, as China reported an 18.1% yearly decline in exports for February. The dollar and yen rallied, while commodity currencies andthe offshore yuan came under pressure.The iShares FTSE China (FXI) exchange traded fund is down 1.03% in the pre-market hours.""We think seasonality and last year’s fake trade reporting contributed to the slump in exports and the trade deficit in China,"" BarCap analysts led by Jian Chang in Hong Kong wrote today.
A moderation in demand also played a part in the weakness in Chinese trade data. Barclays expects export growth to recover to the mid-upper single digits by May-June, and the trade balance to return to surplus by then. The focus will likely remain on China in an otherwise risk-off week, with January-February activity data due out on Thursday.China's average Jan-Feb exports declined 1.6% year over year versus a 7.4% increase in the fourth quarter 2013 and a 4.2% increase in December and 10.6% in January.Premier Li Keqiang and Finance Minister Lou Jiwei reiterated their confidence in the Chinese economy over the past few days, with Li saying the country was on target to grow 7.5% this year.However, they cited improvement in external demand -- which reversed course in February. Li also said that reforms would have an impact in the second half. On Wednesday, Li promised to push ahead a slew of policy changes, including further cutting administrative review and approval items for new businesses, pushing forward hybrid ownership in the State-owned sector and reform of the fiscal and taxation system.Sun Xuegong, a researcher at the Institute of Economic Research in Beijing, told China Daily on Monday that structural reform and growth are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and reform requires a certain level of economic growth.""There is already a lot of talk that when growth is too fast it is not a good time for reform. But what has not been discussed much is when growth slows too much, it is not good for reform either, as decelerated growth and a stagnant living standard will curb the need for industrial upgrading,"" Sun was quoted saying."

741	Reuters Staff4 Min Read* China swings to trade deficit in February, exports tumble * China copper imports fall 30 pct in Feb vs Jan * Bonded Shanghai copper premiums drop $20/T from late Feb   (Updates with closing prices) By Maytaal Angel LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - London copper hit an eight-month low on Monday and Shanghai contracts dropped by their 5 percent daily limit, fanned by fears over the unwinding of copper finance deals in China after its first domestic bond default last week. Adding to the downward pressure, China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide. A further hit came from China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels, however. “Clearly there’s an unwind of positioning in the credit markets in China, and as a result of that, copper which was being held as collateral against that credit is no longer required,” said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at Marex Spectron. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange  closed at $6,649 a tonne from i$6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows. The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent to 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne, its lowest in more than four years. China is the world’s top user of copper, accounting for 40 percent of global demand. But much of its imports are used as collateral to raise funds, which are then loaned out in China’s shadow banking sector. Worries that these financing deals could unravel have intensified since China recorded its first domestic bond default on Friday, when loss-making solar equipment producer Chaori Solar missed an interest payment. “The loan default by a small Chinese company shows that the not everything gets bailed out, and that’s enough to make people nervous. I haven’t seen for 10 years that LME goes down and Shanghai goes down even further,” Herwig Schmidt, head of sales at Triland, said. Reflecting ample supply in China, copper premiums in Shanghai bond have fallen by $20 to $140-$160 from late January, according to China price provider Shmet. (www.shmet.com/) Also Chinese short-term rates and the yuan fell on Monday following the surprisingly weak data on exports, fuelling expectations Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth. Elsewhere, U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus. Hedge funds and money managers turned copper markets into a net short in the week to March 4, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday. Also curtailing risk appetite were worries about escalating tensions in Ukraine. Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution. Aluminium closed at $1,775.50 a tonne from $1,764 at the close on Friday, while zinc ended at $2,040 from $2,059 and lead at $2,084 from $2,096.50. Tin closed at $22,900 a tonne from $22,825 at the close on Friday, and nickel at $15,450 from $15,295.

The first company to default on a public bond in China’s domestic market also has several trust loans outstanding, according to a Chinese brokerage source, raising the risk that Friday’s unprecedented missed payment may have wider implications. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology has at least four outstanding trust loans due this year, the source said. The loss-making solar manufacturer failed to pay a coupon on a Rmb1bn (US$163m) bond last Friday, raising questions over its ability to meet its other obligations. Chaori issued six trust loans in 2011, the source said. The first one, the Rmb80m China Industrial International Trust, was issued on April 21 2011 and matured on October 20 2012. This trust was backed by 5 million Chaori shares held by the company’s chairman Ni Kailu.The other five financings were arranged by Zhongrong International Trust, with an annual interest rate at about 8.6% and a tenor of three years. The third trust loan comes due on July 31 this year, the fourth on September 5, the fifth on October 19 and the sixth on October 12, the source said, adding the information about the due date on the second trust loan was missing.There was a cap of Rmb50m on each of the Zhongrong-arranged trust loans, which means the total of outstanding trust loans could amount to as much as Rmb250m. Those loans are most likely backed by shares, sources said.A failure to honour any of those obligations could trigger a rare default in China’s booming trust market, broadening the impact of Chaori’s situation. A number of trust companies have struggled to repay investors – often including high-net-worth individuals – in recent months, including Jilin Trust, which failed to redeem at maturity in early February. Chaori also owes 18 banks including China Construction Bank, Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China about Rmb1.7bn. These banks have been pressuring the Fengxian government – where Chaori is based – to help with a debt restructuring, according to a research report published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on March 5.China Securities, the arranger of the Rmb1bn five-year bond issued by Chaori in 2012, will send out a notice later today or tomorrow calling bondholders to a meeting where they will discuss proposals to resolve the default, according to a source from China Securities.The Shenzhen-listed Chinese solar equipment producer was unable to make an interest payment on March 7 on the 8.98% bond due 2017, marking the first default on a public bond in China.Trading in the company’s bonds has been suspended since last July after it recorded consecutive losses in 2011 and 2012."

In January the Chinese government bailed out a high-yield loan product sold to private investors.Lu Yu, manager on Allianz Global Investors’ emerging markets equity team, warned that the Chaori Solar bond default could be the catalyst for a short-term equity market crash in China.“China’s credit bubble is worrisome,” Ms Yu said. “A default would be a wake up call for Chinese banks, but I don’t think Chinese credit is going to have a big crisis like we saw in Europe and the US.“The Chinese government knows what is going on and the signals are strong that they are taking this very seriously.”But David Cui, China strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, last week likened the potential default by Chaori Solar to the bailout of Bear Stearns in the US in 2007, a move which Mr Cui said forced investors to rethink their attitude towards corporate debt.Jupiter’s John Chatfeild-Roberts, head of the group’s Merlin multi-manager team, said China was likely to see further bailouts from the state as the government comes to terms with the private sector’s debt issues.“The first signs that many of these loans are at risk of default are now appearing and there are a huge number that will need re-financing this year alone,” Mr Chatfeild-Roberts said.“The most likely outcome is that the central authorities in Beijing will find a way of sweeping these bad loans under the carpet, in order to avoid China suffering from a crisis of confidence.“The $500m bailout of the Credit Equals Gold No1 Trust is a good example of what we could expect to see more of in the future.”Yang Kun, a Shanghai-based bond analyst at Guotai Junan Securities, told the Bloomberg news agency: “It shows regulators’ attitude toward defaults has changed and they’re silently permitting defaults. Risk appetite will slump substantially.”But James Ind, manager of the GLG Total Return fund, said he felt that China had “strong control over its financial system”.He added: “We don’t see a disorderly bank collapse or local government default as being yet on the cards. Their reform agenda is bold, with far-reaching plans to liberalise the economy.”Investments Investments Investments Investments Investments Investments Pensions Legal and General State Pension Financial Adviser is the premier weekly newspaper for UK based financial intermediaries.Money Management is the professional's independent adviser, containing a wealth of in-depth features and unique fund performance statistics.The Financial Times and its journalism are subject to a self-regulation regime under the FT Editorial Code of Practice: www.ft.com/editorialcode© The Financial Times Ltd 2018 ""FT"", ""Financial Times"", ""Money Management"", ""FTAdviser"" and ""Financial Adviser"" are trademarks of The Financial Times Limited and their associated companies.

745	International / 10 March 2014, 1:48pm / ReutersLondon - World stocks paused near a six-year peak and commodities from copper to crude tumbled on Monday as surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors already on edge over the crisis in Ukraine. Relief that Crimea remained largely calm over the weekend helped European shares recover 0.2 percent after Friday's sharp sell-off, though the poor Chinese export numbers and general global uncertainty provided a subdued backdrop. Merger activity in France spurred the CAC 40 but mining firms sensitive to China's appetite for raw materials weighed on Britain's FTSE 100 and German firms' exposure to Russia saw the Dax underperform again. “People sold on Friday on fear of an escalation in Crimea, but things seem to have stabilised now so it's tempting to buy the dip,” said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris. Investors in Asia started the new week on a cautious note as China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18 percent year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. The soft data put a damper on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report that had provided a welcome respite from a run of disappointing data. China's CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent on Monday to its lowest in nearly nine months, copper, of which China is a major consumer, hit a four-year low in Shanghai, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars  also suffered. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  posted its biggest fall in over a month as it lost 1.4 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei stock average shed 1 percent, as disappointing Japanese GDP data compounded the woes. UKRAINE Russian forces tightened their grip on Crimea over the weekend, seizing another border post and a military airfield, ahead of a planned Moscow-backed referendum on Sunday on whether the Black Sea peninsula should join Russia. But diplomatic efforts to cool the crisis continued to calm markets as all sides expressed unease but a general desire to prevent the tensions escalating. The Chinese trade data weighed on currency markets. The Chinese yuan opened down 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates fell amid speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth. The Australian and Canadian dollars, which are highly sensitive to China's appetite for their raw materials, lost as much as half a percent against a broadly steady U.S. dollar . “The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” said Alvin Tan, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London. The euro, in contrast, stayed within striking distance of Friday's 2-1/2 year high peak at $1.3875, touched after the European Central Bank suggested last week that the euro zone recovery was on track with no need for an extra policy push for now. That has pushed rate cut bets back. COPPER SUFFERS Gold edged lower for a second straight session on Monday after the strong U.S. jobs data on Friday eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal's safe-haven appeal. However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a key theme for the precious metal. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to its highest in more than a year. The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude   down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya capped the falls. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility,” said Victor Shum, vice president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. The drop in China's exports pushed three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange down 1.7 percent to $6,663.75 a tonne. It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010.

Copper cathode inventories at China's Shanghai Futures Stock Exchange warehouses rose for the eight straight week to 207,320 mt as of March 7, up 4.6% week on week, according to SHFE data released late Friday.SHFE copper cathode stocks have been rising steadily since January 10, surging 70% from 122,189 mt at the time.The SHFE warehouses are located in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai and Guangdong. They have a combined capacity to store 1.13 million mt of copper cathode, according to information on the SHFE website.Chinese industry analysts attributed the growing stockpiles to weak domestic consumption, pointing out that product from warehouses in the US and Europe were being shipped to China.

751	Canadians will soon need to pay more to watch series and movies on Netflix. The company has raised the price of its plans for both new and existing users. While the rise has been already implemented for new subscribers, existing users will be notified through email before new rates are charged from them.In a statement released by Netflix, the company cited addition of new content and introduction of new features and services as the reasons behind the price rise. It said that Netflix adjusts the pricing of its packages from time to time as they introduce new movies, exclusive TV series and upgrade their platform to offer better services to its customers.The company has a huge database of content and also produces its own original content which has become popular like House of Cards. It also has a large number of movies sourced exclusively from international film festivals. Few of USA TV shows are also aired by Netflix in Canada like CW’s Riverdale and ABC’s Scandal.Netflix has a growing market in Canada and in 2016 it had around 5.2 million subscriptions. The television streaming market is quite competitive in Canada and many leading names are fighting out with each other.Brands like Amazon prime are quite a hit in the country having Canadian airing rights of highly rated shows such as American Gods and Mr. Robot. CBS All Access is also set to enter the Canadian market sometime in 2018 with its 9,000 episodes from various shows. The multiple numbers of competitors and the fight to acquire rights for shows has increased the acquisition cost of the content. Though Netflix did not mention it in their statement, still it is a situation faced by all companies in Canadian television industry.Netflix increased their prices last year in May while introducing the feature of streaming in high quality on multiple devices. This time the increase has been $1 for the basic plan making it $8.99 per month. Users can only stream standard quality videos on a single device at a time. The cost of the standard plan has also gone up by $1 ($10.99 per month) which permits subscribers to access content on two screens. Subscribers of the premium plan now have to shell out a monthly $13.99, which is a $2 increase from the previous price. Users can view high definition 4k videos simultaneously on four screens with this plan.The company changes its prices based on local market conditions in a country. The Australian subscribers had to pay few dollars more after Netflix raised the prices in June countering the increase in local taxes. It remains to be seen how the users will respond to the move.TV streaming service in Canada will get a major boost next year with the introduction of CBS Corp’s CBS All Access service. It is the company’s bid to go international that prompted the move and gave Canada the first opportunity to enjoy its content.The online streaming service in the US has a huge database of content and around 9,000 episodes from its various series. Viewers will also get access to special CBS channels like Showtime without requiring a cable connection. Apart from television activities, those who fond of games playing can try out one of the secure Canadian source NBSO online casino games list website. It is free and has a high level of reliability (si vous parlez français, essayez de choisir des jeux sur le site web du guide spécial casino en ligne, qui est fiable et gratuit).CBS corp. has a good chance of creating a considerable grab on the market but it lacks on one ground. The copyrights of many of its shows are already purchased by Canadian broadcasters like Rogers Communications Inc., BCE Inc. and Corus Entertainment Inc. So viewers will not get to see shows like Survivor or The Big Bang Theory and some of the shows are also aired on Netflix. The restricted content may impact the number of subscribers the company is expecting.We have to wait and see as CBS predicts they are going to have 4 million subscriptions by the end of this year. It is interesting to note that TV viewership is declining in Canada and online streaming services are giving a tough competition to the traditional form. In 2016, the volume of subscribers reduced by 1% and reached 11.1 billion viewers and the revenue fell by 2% amounting to $8.7 billion, according to the data from Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.On the other hand, online streaming services have gained increased number of subscriptions. Netflix recorded a growth of 52 million viewers in US alone and another 52 million from all over the world. Compared to that, 158,000 people in Canada disconnected their cable service in 2015. It can be expected that the market is ripe for online streaming in Canada and other players like Hulu and HBO Go may join the competition in some years.With so many providers in the game, the price is also a big factor in getting subscriptions. CBS did not reveal the rates they will charge in Canada, but in the US current rates are $5.99 per month. To get a commercial free version, viewers have to pay $9.99. If the rates are any higher, then Canadian may not be too interested in joining up considering the limitation of content.Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS said that they were aware of the potential of online streaming judging the success of their competitors. The introduction of the service in Canada gives them the chance to directly reach the viewer on an increased scale which can be expanded globally. CBS All Access had achieved a growing domestic market and now is ready with their premium content to hit the international arena.Auto insurance provider Intact Insurance in Nova Scotia plan to use mobile apps to track driver habits to determine the premium rates in the future. Based on the way one drives, they can be eligible for a 25% savings on their insurance premium!The idea may sound out of a science fiction movie but the concept has existed for some time. Many companies like Intact Insurance offer a plug in dongles for vehicles which are used to track driver habits. Intact insurance revealed that the dongle program included 350,000 participants from all over the country. It was introduced at N.S in 2014.However, they are not always the practical solution due to various reasons.First is the cost that prohibits their universal use and in some cases, the devices are not returned to the company. They can also be lost adding to the cost of the company. Another reason is the dongles track the habits of any driver that gets behind the wheel and it is not possible to distinguish between them.Mobile apps have many unique advantages that make them a pragmatic solution for the insurance companies. The app would be using the smart phone of the driver and eliminate any expense on part of the insurance provider. They will also be able to specifically track the habits of the insurance payer which is their priority. It will only monitor the main driver as the app will be linked to his mobile phone.The tool will be used to track aspects of sudden accelerations, hard braking, night driving utilizing the GPS feature of the phones. Intact Insurance applied for permission to launch the program from the N.S Utility and Review Board which was granted on August 4. The company plans to launch the service next month starting September. The initiative will be a way to reward drivers with good habits and give them lower insurance rates for their performance.For the time being, the app or the dongle insurance rates are optional in Canada. But according to experts, a day may come when it automatically becomes more preferable considering the costs. With the advance of technology, the companies may increase the cost of the premium and people will opt for the tracking program for affordability.But not all customers may be willing to join the program. It has been seen that many consumers do not prefer to join such programs. Some also practice bad driving habits like speeding or other dangerous stunts which may impact the insurance rates. There are also some apprehensions about the nature of data collected by the app and its usage by the company. But as the insurance industry is regulated it has not misused the user data under its control.	Business
752	"Global Times reported that the most traded copper contract for delivery in May declined by 0.45% on the Shanghai Futures Exchange Friday compared to Thursday, ending at CNY 48,920 per tonne. It also decreased by 0.73% WoW. The trading volume expanded by 2,154 lots to 134,000 lots Friday.Friday's fall in copper on the SHFE came as cautious investors awaited news of the US employment situation, amid low expectations for Friday's US payrolls data.Mr Li Keqiang Chinese Premier said that the country's economic growth target for 2014 would be around 7.5%. This target will probably involve some easing of the reform agenda, which is likely supportive for bulks as the pressure to reduce steel capacity may temporarily ease.The news also propped up investor sentiment slightly in the global copper market. Investors hope China can maintain its robust demand for commodities in general and for metals in particular, as it would support prices this year.China is the world's largest consumer of base metals, and accounts for nearly 40% of global copper demand. China's imports of major commodities were quite strong in February, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs Saturday. But the price of industrial commodities such as copper still fell in February.Source - Global Times<a href=""http://www.metalguru.in /"">(www.metalguru.in)</a>Tags:

  The big market story of the day? It was a brutal session in
  China.

  Over the weekend, a bunch of bad economic data came out,
  including an exceptionally weak export number.

  That led to a swift market reaction in China.
The Shanghai
  Composite, which is already having a fairly rough year, lost
  2.86%.
Copper
  tanked 1.5%. Copper tends to be sensitive to Chinese
  industrial demand and is having a horrible year.

  The Chinese Yuan continues to slide, and is now at its lowest
  level since late last year.

  Meanwhile, the ripples were felt across Asia, with Hong Kong
  losing 1.7%, Korea down 1%, Japan off 1%, and Australia off 0.9%.

758	"There has been a security incident on this website between 24th December 2016 and 26th October 2017. Please click here for more information.10th March, 2014 10:09 AM by Martin hayesBase metals continued to fall on Monday’s LME pre-market, with prices extending the declines seen during the previous session.  The copper price, which plummeted to its lowest for nine months, led the way.In the others, lead hit a three-month low and zinc fell to its lowest for two weeks while aluminium and nickel price both dropped to their softest for a week.The losses reflected wider events and macroeconomic uncertainties, notably the continued crisis in Ukraine and, more pertinently for the metals, negative trade data for China, the world’s second largest economy, traders said.“The rout in copper has seen prices gap lower this morning and the weakness has flowed into the other base metals including the likes of nickel and aluminium, which were [previously] boosted by concerns over the potential for disruption to Russian supply should sanctions be imposed,” FastMarkets analyst William Adams said.Weakness in copper was sparked on Friday on combined pressure from the geopolitical tension in Ukraine and news that a Chinese solar panel maker had defaulted on interest payments owed on bonds. Previously, the government and state-owned banks have helped bail out or provide last-minute loans to Chinese firms in trouble.Copper prices were battered by waves of technical sales and the market unravelled further this morning, hitting a low of $6,608 before settling at $6,690 per tonne, a $92 loss from the weak Friday close.The key number on the downside is $6,602 – this was the June 2103 low. Below here, prices will be at levels last seen in July 2010.“6,600 is a key level, as a break through signals a move to $6,200. However, lower prices will bring in some consumer pricing that might temporarily halt the slide,” Malcolm Freeman of Kingdom Futures said.Worries were amplified by the perception of a weakening Chinese economy, with poor export numbers weighing on sentiment – exports from China dropped 18.1 percent in February on the same month of last year. Even though copper imports were above year-ago levels, they were down from the January 2014 total.On the data side, Italian industrial production rose 1.0 percent but the comparative number for France came in at a decline of 0.2 percent. The Sentix investor confidence index was a lower-than-expected 13.9.The euro was holding at a steady 1.3880 against the dollar – on Friday its hit 1.3913, its highest for more than two years.In the metals, warehouse inventory trends failed to help copper – stocks dropped a net 3,600 tonnes to 265,400 tonnes, the lowest again since December 2012.In others, zinc’s reversal from last week’s one-year high continued, with recent business at $2,024, a $35 loss. Warehouse stocks rose for the third day in a row – up 16,375 tonnes to 792,375 tonnes, the highest since February 18. The increase reflected a 20,000-tonne warranting in New Orleans, where 50,000 tonnes have been warranted in three days.The lead price fell as low as $2,061, its cheapest since December 3, and then settled at $2,068, a $35.50 decline – stocks dropped 175 tonnes to 203,800 tonnes. Aluminium fell to $1,758, a $6 loss, while stocks were down 7,500 tonnes at 5,285,700 tonnes.Nickel at $15,144 was down from a previous $15,250, with inventories climbing 576 tonnes to an all-time high of 271,200 tonnes. Tin business at $22,938 was up $113 but stocks climbed 100 tonnes to 9,205 tonnes.Steel billet was neglected, as were cobalt and molybdenum prices, with no inventory movements seen.(Additional reporting by Eddie van der Walt, editing by Mark Shaw)

764	4 Min Read SINGAPORE, March 10 (Reuters) - Copper sank to 8-1/2 month lows on Monday, dropping steeply for a second session, while oil lost more than a dollar and Shanghai-traded commodities slumped after a surprise fall in China's exports heightened fears of an economic slowdown.     China's exports fell 18.1 percent in February from a year ago, confounding market expectations for an increase and adding to a series of weak factory surveys from the start of 2014 that point to weakness in economic activity at the world's top consumer of most commodities.  Chinese commodities bore the brunt of the sell-off, with Shanghai copper sliding 5 percent, rubber down more than 4 percent and Dalian iron ore futures slumping nearly 6 percent. China’s equities sank to a five-year low.  “The China data shows there will be more difficult times ahead,” an iron ore trader in Shanghai said.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange hit a session low of $6,608 a tonne, its cheapest since June 25.  The metal was down 1.4 percent at $6,690 by 0842 GMT, adding to a 3.8 percent loss on Friday which was its steepest decline since April 2012.  Copper in Shanghai fell by its daily downside limit of 5 percent to close at 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne.  Despite a drop in overall exports, China’s imports of most commodities from copper to crude oil and iron ore rose in February from a year ago. The weak exports suggest China’s commodity import demand could weaken in the coming months as end-users draw down swollen inventories.  But China’s imports of oil, copper and iron ore all fell from levels in January.  “Fundamental demand has not resumed to normal levels yet,” said analyst Chunlan Li of minerals consultancy CRU in Beijing.  Brent crude declined $1.13 to $107.87 a barrel, snapping a two-day rise fuelled by tensions between Russia and Ukraine that could potentially disrupt oil supplies.  U.S. oil fell $1.25 to $101.33, after touching a high of $102.82.  Russian forces tightened their grip on Moscow-backed Crimea by seizing another border and a military airfield as German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Russian President Vladimir Putin that a planned referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.  Shanghai steel futures dropped 4 percent to a contract low of 3,221 yuan a tonne, and Dalian’s iron ore slid 5.9 percent to 728 yuan a tonne, its weakest since the bourse introduced iron ore futures on Oct. 18.  Steel demand in China, the world’s biggest consumer and producer, has been weak since the start of the year as a slowing economy curbs demand for the building material.  Construction activity, which typically picks up from March, is unlikely to spur a strong recovery in demand for steel as Beijing pursues economic expansion that is less driven by investment and more fuelled by domestic consumption.  Spot gold fell for a second session and hit a one-week low of $1,328.86 an ounce, largely due to the strong U.S. employment data released on Friday that suggested the Federal Reserve’s stimulus tapering efforts will stay on course.  But some traders say the disappointing Chinese trade data also weighed as investors in Shanghai futures and spot contracts sold bullion. China is the world’s top gold consumer.  “We can see liquidation from the Shanghai futures exchange and there is no fresh buying interest on the physical side,” said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Hong Kong’s Wing Fung Precious Metals.  U.S. corn and wheat dropped more than 1 percent as investors squared positions ahead of a U.S. government report on global supply-demand of agricultural products due later in the day.  $1 = 6.1260 Chinese yuan Editing by Himani SarkarAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

May futures tumbled 4.2 percent to USD 3.0825 a pound, the heftiest one-day drop since December 2011, and the lowest level since July.Analysts closely watch copper prices as a barometer for global risk appetite, as it is sensitive to macro-economic developments.""I am a little bit concerned by it [copper`s fall],"" Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance, told CNBC Asia`s Squawk Box on Monday.""The [China] data wasn`t that impressive, and when you combine that with [last week`s bond] default, it presents a weak picture in terms of demand and ongoing ripples that that will cause. So copper did fall out of bed, which I think was something that was expected,"" he added.Copper contracts for delivery May 14, on the Commodities Exchange Centre (CEC), over the past five days.Copper`s swoon comes against a backdrop of worry about slowing Chinese demand, which has seen prices slump 9.2 percent year to date. China, the world`s largest copper importer, accounts for around 40 percent of global demand.According to the Shanghai Futures Exchange, copper stockpiles increased for an eighth straight week last week, their longest rising streak in two years.""Any kind of weakness in demand is going to highlight the fact that the market is potentially reaching a tipping point between supply and demand,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst for CMC Markets in Australia.""Broadly speaking, leaving out the global financial crisis, a shortage of copper caused by the growth of China has kept prices strong. Now as copper production is growing faster than demand, the market`s slight deficit could turn into a slight surplus - which will have a big impact on prices,"" he said, adding that in his view copper`s fair value sits between USD 2.75 and USD 3 a pound.""Copper prices normally see strong technical support at USD 3, if we break below that it could move lower,"" Spooner added.Official data released over the weekend showed China moved into a trade deficit for the first time in 11 months after exports fell 18.1 percent on year in February, provoking concern over the health of the world`s second largest economy.Adding to the pain was benign inflation data showing consumer prices rose 2 percent in February, the slowest rate in 13 months.

771	China's CSI300 share index sank to a five-year closing low on Monday, dragged down by financials after tepid economic data reignited fears of a bigger slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.The CSI300 of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings dived 3.3 per cent, hitting its lowest close since February 2, 2009. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 2.9 per cent at 1,999.1 points in its worst day since June 24.The Nasdaq-style ChiNext Composite Index of mainly high tech startups listed inShenzhen tumbled 3.7 per cent.China's consumer prices rose 2 per cent in February from a year earlier, their slowest rate in 13 months as pork prices fell by their most in over a year, a sign that slowing growth rather than rising prices poses a risk.Exports in February fell 18.1 per cent from a year earlier, following a 10.6 per cent rise in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Saturday. Imports rose 10.1 per cent, yielding a trade deficit of $US23 billion for the month versus a surplus of $US32 billion in January.ReutersSave articles for later.Subscribe for unlimited access to news.

772	"There has been a security incident on this website between 24th December 2016 and 26th October 2017. Please click here for more information.10th March, 2014 6:20 AM by Will AdamsThe copper price was the weak link on Friday – it had been struggling for most of the week and struggled to run up when the likes of nickel and aluminium rose.Its aggressive sell-off ultimately pulled the other metals lower – the base metals were down an average of 2.2 percent by the close, with the copper price off 3.9 percent at $6,777 and lead and zinc both two percent lower. The low on copper was $6,772 but prices have moved lower since.Concerns over the state of China’s economy seem to be setting the tone this morning, with a poor Chinese export number weighing on sentiment. Exports from China reportedly dropped 18.1 percent in February from February 2013.
The base metals are down one percent on average, with the nickel price off 2.3 percent at $14,920, copper 1.5 percent at $6,674.50, lead one percent at $2,078, zinc 0.4 percent at $2,049 and aluminium 0.9 percent at $1,750, while tin is little changed at $22,999.Volume on the LME has been exceptionally high, with 16,045 lots traded, of which 9,307 lots have been copper. The copper price is now down $348 compared with Friday morning.In Shanghai, the May base metals are down an average of 2.4 percent, with copper limit down, off 5 percent at 46,670 yuan. The zinc price is down 2.2 percent at 14,845 yuan, lead down 1.3 percent at 13,670 yuan and aluminium off 0.9 percent at 13,125 yuan.Rebar is also weaker, down 4 percent at 3,123 yuan. It seems to have been a long time since copper last dropped by its daily limit in Shanghai.Spot copper in Changjiang is down 4.9 percent at 46,450-46,650 yuan, which puts the spot level with the futures, while the LME/Shanghai copper arb ratio is weak at 6.98 – Shanghai prices have fallen in line with the LME price.Equities – read moreCurrencies – read moreThe economic agenda – read moreThe rout in copper has seen prices gap lower this morning and the weakness has flowed into the other base metals including the likes of nickel and aluminium, which were being boosted by concerns over the potential for disruption to Russian supply should sanctions be imposed.The copper price has traded as low as $6,608, almost reaching the June low of $6,602; concerns over China and the high levels of stocks in the country seem to be behind the weakness. In the short term, copper prices look oversold but, with Shanghai prices limit down, it is difficult to know whether prices still have further to fall.(Editing by Mark Shaw)

778	"IPOCentral China Securities looks to raise up to US$400m from share offer in the city in first half after two years of planning for a mainland debutComments:  After two years, Central China Securities has scrapped its plans for an initial public offering in Shanghai as the mainland brokerage believes it will be easier and quicker to raise up to US$400 million in Hong Kong.The mid-sized firm, based in Henan province, appeared on the global radar in 2008 when it announced with Wall Street bank Citigroup a plan to set up an investment banking joint venture.The plan was later scrapped as Citigroup decided to team up with other local partners.Central China Securities had hired CCB International, the Hong Kong-based investment banking arm of China Construction Bank, one of the Big Four state-run banks headquartered in Beijing, to be the lead sponsor for its upcoming offer in Hong Kong, people familiar with the situation said.The firm had not yet formally applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for the listing, but it aimed to launch it within two months, the sources said.""It will definitely be in the first half of this year,"" one of them said. ""The market environment changes quickly, and the key is to get listed as soon as you can.""Central China Securities' plans for a Hong Kong float came as a surprise to some industry executives, but others said it reflected the new thinking at the mainland's securities regulator.During the annual meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the industry watchdog might abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the regulator.This would make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the future.Yao's remark is good news for capital-hungry mainland firms facing a nationwide downturn in economic growth, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a large backlog from the recently lifted 15-month suspension of listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses.""Timing means everything in the financial business,"" said another source. ""Central China Securities has sort of wasted two years in preparing its plan for a Shanghai IPO, and as it has been proven to be much easier to list in Hong Kong, then why not?""The trick to getting a company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days: first, secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half the shares in the flotation.That is why some bankers joke that Hong Kong's listing market looks more like a series of private placements these days.Mainland brokerages are no strangers to the Hong Kong stock market. Top-tier players such as Citic Securities and Haitong Securities have listed in the city in the past few years. So have mainland banks, including all the Big Four.You are signed up.

780	International / 10 March 2014, 08:00am / BloombergHong Kong and Beijing - China’s exports fell last month by the most since the global financial crisis, dealing another blow to confidence as Communist Party leaders meeting in Beijing assess the risk from the nation’s first onshore bond default.Shipments abroad dropped 18.1 percent from a year earlier in February, the customs administration said at the weekend, trailing the median estimate for a 7.5 percent rise in a survey of 45 economists.Distortions in the data from the Lunar New Year holiday and fake invoicing that inflated data last year make it harder to assess the true picture. As China chases a 7.5 percent annual growth target, set at last week’s meeting of the National People’s Congress, officials need to contain stresses in the financial system from the credit boom that began with stimulus measures in 2008.“People see a lot of negative news coming out of China: growth momentum is slowing and when there is a default of one company they tend to think it’s going to be a systemic problem and spill over into the rest of the economy,” said Ding Shuang, a senior China economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong. “These numbers may support their negative views, that even external demand may not be that strong.”Even so, the drop in exports was not as bad as it appeared when taking into account the holiday, the inflated base of last year’s numbers, as well as a weather-related “soft patch” in the US economy, said Ding, whose forecast of an 8.5 percent decline in sales was closest to the customs figure.Imports rose 10.1 percent, more than projected.Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology, a maker of solar cells, on Friday became the first company to default in China’s onshore bond market after failing to pay full interest due.The number of publicly traded non-financial Chinese firms whose debt-to-equity ratios exceed 200 percent has jumped 57 percent since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite index had its first gain in three weeks last week, rising 0.1 percent after a 2.7 percent drop the previous week. The yuan posted its biggest weekly increase since October last year, following a record decline of 1.4 percent last month, on speculation the central bank ceased engineering a decline in the currency to discourage appreciation bets.Trade would be a “clear drag” on growth in the first quarter and the yuan should weaken this week, said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist and strategist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.“The trade data explain some of the downward pressure on the yuan in February – it can be justified not only by central bank guidance but by actual deterioration of demand and supply in the forex market,” he said.Analysts’ estimates for last month’s exports ranged from a drop of 8.5 percent to a 14.4 percent increase. The decline, after a 10.6 percent gain in January, was the biggest since August 2009. The rise in imports compared with the median forecast for a 7.6 percent gain and a 10 percent advance in January. - BloombergGuptas face arrest in daysMEC disappointed, disgusted by videos of Reiger Park principal with pupilsUniversity of Zimbabwe publishes Grace Mugabe's thesisBrian Molefe's woes aren’t over – they’re only just beginningZuma has not asked for immunity, says RamaphosaSign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.

785	The DiplomatThe Chaori default may improve risk signaling, but broader reforms are still needed.Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Company has failed to make an interest payment on its corporate bonds in the first corporate bond default in China. This default has caused quite a stir among analysts, many of whom view this as an opportunity for China’s corporate bond market to enhance its risk pricing mechanism.This highlights some issues with China’s corporate bond market. First, the excessively optimistic bond rating assigned to corporations like Chaori, which had experienced financial distress for months preceding the default, needs to be checked with more realistic ratings. Second, while the Chaori default may promote better risk pricing, it may also cause a bifurcation of bond rating and pricing between state-owned companies and their subsidiaries, which have the implicit backing of the government, and non-state ownership types. This would reinforce the financing bias against non-state firms, and not truly reflect creditworthiness. Third, while the corporate bond market in China for bonds with AA- ratings or above is relatively liquid, the market for bonds with ratings below this mark is relatively illiquid, further reinforcing the bond market bifurcation. Fourth, as the corporate bond market is expected to expand to include more local government financing vehicle bonds, there is a question of how these bonds will be viewed by the market; i.e., will they be viewed as government backed or not, and will the bond rating take precedence over the fact that they represent local government debt?In other words, China continues to lag behind in risk rating and pricing of the corporate bond market and until these issues are addressed, it will continue to do so. Although some analysts believed bonds were making strides in pricing risk before the Chaori failure, the fact that many bonds are rated as AA- or above even though the interest coverage ratio (using EBITDA) is negative or less than one, revealing a weakness in ability to pay the bond coupon, shows that China’s corporate bond market is less resilient than it appears.What does this mean for the rest of the financial economy? While some have predicted that the Chaori event will result in a revelation of risk exposure and correction across the board, it seems unlikely that this will be the case, in part due to the issues presented above. Other financial sectors of the economy have responded to risks in different ways, some with local government bailouts, as in the case of trusts, some with central government bailouts, as in the case of banks, and some with failures, as in the case of private finance. This can be attributed to the high degree of segmentation in China’s financial economy, in which the activities of financial instruments may not move in tandem, and to a lack of financial marketization, in which financial activity is not governed by interest rates or other strong market forces.Without some fundamental, institutional changes in China’s financial economy, “market forces” will continue to be prevented from taking shape. While the Chaori incident may improve risk signaling in the non-state owned portion of the corporate bond market, it will by no means be a catalyst for positive change in the rest of the financial economy. Major reform must take place before Chinese finance relies on the natural forces of exchange rather than artificial forces posed by state owned institutions, regulated interest rates, and automatic bailout mechanisms.Sara Hsu is an Assistant Professor of Economics at the State University of New York at New Paltz and has written extensively about shadow banking and the Chinese economy.

786	Reuters Staff4 Min Read* HSI -1.6 pct, H-shares -1.6 pct, CSI300 -1.9 pct * Cyclicals lead selloff after weak China data stokes slowdown fears * Jiangxi Copper H-share at 8-mth low, Cinda Asset Management up * China Southern Air sinks on sliding yuan, Malaysia air accident By Clement Tan HONG KONG, March 10 (Reuters) - China’s CSI300 index slid to its lowest in nearly nine months early Monday, weighing on Hong Kong markets, after data showed exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, reigniting some fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. Data over the weekend also showed inflation remained benign, but some investors were more concerned that producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month, as the lack of pricing power suggested China is still struggling with excess capacity. At midday, the CSI300 of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings was down 1.9 percent at its lowest since June 25. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 1.7 percent. The Hang Seng Index shed 1.6 percent to 22,294.9 points, its lowest since Feb. 26. The China Enterprises Index  of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also sank 1.6 percent to its lowest in a month. “Markets are over-reacting a little today, nobody’s caring too much about the data skew from the different timing of the Chinese New Year this year from last year,” said Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Finance. “That said, my longer-term prognosis on China remains  pessimistic. Unless you see a turnaround in producer prices, which would suggest they are getting excess capacity under control, it’s not possible to play the China macro game,” Wong added. Cyclical counters Anhui Conch Cement   fell 4.7 percent in Hong Kong and 3.8 percent in Shanghai. Jiangxi Copper  tumbled 4.5 percent to an eight-month low in Hong Kong and 4.8 percent in Shanghai. China’s consumer prices rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, their slowest rate in 13 months as pork prices fell by their most in over a year, a sign that slowing growth rather than rising prices poses a bigger risk. Exports in February fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier, following a 10.6 percent rise in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Saturday. Imports rose 10.1 percent, yielding a trade deficit of $23 billion for the month versus a surplus of $32 billion in January. Markets failed to take any cheer from an official China Securities Journal commentary on Monday, which highlighted the difficulty of hitting this year’s 7.5 percent growth target, while suggesting policies aimed at balancing overall reform with stable growth are likely due in the second quarter. In Hong Kong, China Construction Bank sank 1.9 percent, as did China Cinda Asset Management, which was created to manage bad debts. Nomura banking analyst Lucy Feng on Monday recommended a long Cinda and short CCB trade. She downgraded CCB to neutral on rising concerns of property-related loans. A plunging yuan further weighed on airlines, port operators, shippers and exporters. China’s yuan opened trade at 6.1554 per dollar on Monday, down 0.5 percent from Friday’s close of 6.1260. If losses hold, this would be the currency’s biggest one-day loss since December 2008. China Southern Airlines underperformed the airlines sector in Hong Kong, sinking 3.5 percent. Further hurting the stock was news that two passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight had bought tickets using stolen passports through the Chinese carrier on a code-share basis. “That incident will inevitably weigh on sentiment on its stock,” said Ample Finance’s Wong. Tencent Holdings shares ended a volatile morning  down 2 percent after buying a 15 percent stake in e-commerce firm JD.com for $214.7 million, as the two seek to challenge Alibaba Group Holding’s dominant position in online shopping in China.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

787	A laborer rests during a lunch break at the Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding company's shipyard in Shanghai in this Oct. 14, 2013, file photo. (Reuters Photo/Carlos Barria)Goldman Sachs is sticking with its recommendation to buy Chinese stocks, the biggest losers worldwide this year, after valuations fell to the lowest level in a decade versus global peers.“Given how share prices have corrected and given where the valuations are, from a risk-reward standpoint we still think we can make a positive case on Chinese equities,” Kinger Lau, a strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview in Hong Kong on March 4. He predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index will climb 24 percent to 12,000 in the next 12 months, versus the brokerage’s December forecast for the measure to reach 13,600 by the end of 2014.The index of Chinese shares in Hong Kong lost 10 percent this year through last week, the most among 93 global benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg, as factory gauges pointed to a slowdown in the economy and concern grew that more companies will struggle to repay debt after the nation’s first onshore corporate bond default on March 7. The gauge trades at a 45 percent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index, the most in a decade.China’s leaders are trying to balance clampdowns on the shadow-banking industry and local-government debt with measures to support growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology became the first company to default in China after failing to pay full interest due last week on onshore bonds.The Hang Seng China index added 0.4 percent to 9,709.49 on March 7. The measure is valued at 1.1 times net assets, the biggest discount since September 2003 to MSCI’s global index, which has a multiple of 2.Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China all trade at about the same level as their net assets, while Bank of China has a price-to-book ratio of 0.8. The four lenders are the nation’s biggest by market value.“Any clear and concrete policy measures in terms of dealing with shadow banking loans and local government debt would likely be positive catalysts for banks,” Lau said. “Valuations for Chinese banks have already priced in a very significant crisis scenario.”Premier Li Keqiang told the National People’s Congress last week that China will develop a regulated regional borrowing mechanism, after local-government liabilities surged to 17.9 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) as of June 2013 from 10.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2010. Authorities have also started a cleanup of the $6 trillion shadow-banking industry and identified sectors of the economy in need of consolidation.While Chinese banks’ non-performing loans rose by 28.5 billion yuan in the last quarter of 2013 to 592.1 billion yuan, the highest since September 2008, bad loans only accounted for 1 percent of total lending, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said Feb. 13.Bank valuations currently imply a non-performing loan ratio of about 7 percent, Lau said.An improving global economic outlook may also be a catalyst for a rally in Chinese shares, Lau said, declining to name specific stocks.The World Bank raised its 2014 growth forecasts for advanced nations in January to 2.2 percent from 2 percent, while cutting its estimates for developing nations to 5.3 percent from 5.6 percent. China is the world’s biggest exporter.China last week retained a target for 7.5 percent growth in 2014 for the $9 trillion economy. Gross domestic product expanded 7.7 percent in 2013, the same pace as in 2012.A purchasing managers’ index from HSBC and Markit Economics dropped to a seven-month low of 48.5, the companies said March 3. A similar gauge from the government with a larger sample size fell to 50.2, the lowest since June, a report showed March 1. Numbers above 50 signal expansion.Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, customs data showed March 8, compared with analysts’ median estimate for a 7.5 percent increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July, according to a statistics bureau report yesterday, extending the longest decline since 1999.The Hang Seng China gauge has tumbled 16 percent since Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, predicted on Dec. 2 that the H-share measure would rally 18 percent by the end of 2014.Goldman Sachs’s forecast formed part of a trade recommendation in which the bank told investors to buy Chinese stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities would lag the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade its fourth top recommendation for 2014.Bloomberg	Business

789	"Possible end to policy requiring mainland firms seeking funds in city to seek approval may result in a flood of listings by second-rate firmsComments:  ""As long as you can meet the listing requirements of the Hong Kong stock exchange, you should definitely go there.""That was the clear message from one of the most senior stock market regulators on the mainland when asked about the funding needs of small-sized, capital-hungry private enterprises.During the once-a-year political summit in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the mainland's stock market watchdog may simply abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the CSRC. This will make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the foreseeable future.Yao's comment is certainly good news for mainland firms fighting the nationwide economic downturn, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a 15-month suspension of domestic listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen where the mainland's two national bourses are based. But is this really good news for Hong Kong?The Hong Kong stock exchange may welcome the move as more IPOs from the north could strengthen the city's position as a global capital-raising centre - it was the world's No2 destination for IPOs in terms of total amount raised last year. The New York stock exchange was in first place.Investment bankers will also welcome the move for sure. The more IPOs, the more fees they get, and that also means bigger bonuses. However, let's consider the quality of the IPOs rather than the quantity.Last week in Beijing Yao encouraged the nation's small and medium-sized private enterprises to first consider Hong Kong, not Shanghai or Shenzhen, for listing partly because of the widely accepted assumption in the financial industry that small firms have an easier time raising money here than on the mainland.He also indicated that large state-owned enterprises, although they have the freedom to come to Hong Kong for IPOs, should still consider domestic listings as their first choice. Fund managers say Yao's comments are in line with Beijing's long-term stance that quality blue-chip companies should list domestically so mainland investors can first share in their business success, and perhaps enjoy fat dividends as well.Then what about Hong Kong? By welcoming these smaller firms from the north, which may find it hard to raise money at home, are we turning the Hong Kong stock market into a rubbish bin, or are we just Plan B for those who cannot list at home.The trick to getting any company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days; just secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half your IPO shares. That's why some bankers joke that Hong Kong's IPO market looks more like a series of private placements these days.An IPO should be a new beginning, not the end, for any responsible, listed company. You come to Hong Kong not to raise money easily here, but because you are committed to the stock market and your public shareholders. George Chen is the Post's financial services editor.

I do think that the Chinese must be a little concerned about their real exchange rate. Its appreciation has been nothing short of spectacular since the GFC:  If that’s true then the PBOC has just embarked on a major loosening, not the warning to speculators about currency appreciation that I interpreted its moves as last week. Not beyond the realms of possibility given the pressure coming to bear in the economy!China released its Dec QTR data dump last nightChina house prices are out for December and theIn the past week we've seen mounting evidenceWall Street Journal on a theme dear to our heartsOh the joys of rebalancing!Perhaps it might be better to stop using a word like ‘rebalancing’ that implies a carefully calibrated shifting of levers and policies to adjust the mix of an economy.How about ‘jabbing the elephant with a sharp stick’For example:The Chinese government last week announced a change to economic policy and that it would start ‘jabbing the elephant with a sharp stick’.Bystanders are advised to take care.With the Japanese firing three arrows at their elephant, Yellen still handing out safari grade Bennies to the US elephant and the Europeans breaking bamboo poles over the dead euro elephant, the world economy is a dangerous place.lolThat Chinese Elephant is going to look like a Porcupine before this is all over.I find all of this concerning. The shadow banking system over there is a few Trillion compared to the U.S Sub prime problem at $1.2T. All the stats are heading in the wrong direction, money supply real estate topping out Producer prices, exports.
 If BofA are right and the Solar Co. default was the bear sterns moment with GFC2 to come it will be worse then GFC1, so much has been invested to feed the Dragon, here and in the other emerging markets. It will hit Australia much harder just as our industrial base is crumbling the TOT will crumble. Sometime ago I saw a chart which showed all the commodity booms over the last 200 odd years.
They all ended with a bang.This looks like it could be the biggest Bang yet.Rod77,Your concerns are noted (actually more than that) but it is all good.“We know everything we need to know because Pascoe told us so.”Apologies to Brian “That’s the way it is” Henderson.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcUo5PU80EoI can’t lay my hands on the exact piece, but I recall Albert Edwards warning that it’s time to take cover when the yuan starts to devalue to protect its home turf. (the best I can come up with!)“We identify China as suffering from excessive currency strength relative to regional competitors, both in nominal, and most especially, in real terms,”
http://www.cnbc.com/id/100896703If I understand the trades correctly (which I’m fairly certain I do) depreciation is bad for Chinese companies using LC/Commodity backed financing.  Remember they have to pay back their LCs in USD; maybe some of them are hedging their FX risk but I doubt it.  Falling commodity prices, tightening credit conditions, falling yuan – every aspect of the financing deal is moving against the creditors.Margin call de-stock of IO in T-Minus….

793	"Chinese touristsLatest protest sees marchers dressed as Red Guards, equating patriotism with staying homeComments:  Dozens of protesters, some dressed in Red Guard uniforms, marched through Mong Kok yesterday urging mainland visitors to ""love their country and party"" - and stay at home.They waved copies of Mao's ""little red book"" and chanted slogans like, ""Love your motherland, use products that are made in China"" as they gathered at the sitting-out area in Dundas Street.Some also waved Chinese and Communist Party flags. They said the aim of the march was to reignite patriotic feelings in mainlanders.""If they really love their country, they should stay and shop on the mainland, not come to Hong Kong,"" said Leung Song, 24, convenor of the march's organiser, the Coalition of True Love for Country and Party.Leung said they bought the costumes and props from Taobao, a mainland e-commerce platform. ""We support Chinese products and our motherland,"" he said.Another protester, Alex Lam, 21, a university student, said: ""We do not dislike mainland tourists. We simply want to support them in their development of patriotic love, and think it'd be better for them to buy Chinese instead of foreign imported products.""The group organised the protest on Facebook where an event page, ""True love for country and party march"", was created. About 350 people clicked that they would attend.Police upset the protesters by splitting them into small groups for the march. They then separated themselves into their own groups and marched along Sai Yeung Choi Street South, ignoring police orders.Some of them marched to Nathan Road after reaching Argyle Street. They shouted abuse at mainland customers inside shops, forcing some Nathan Road jewellery stores to close briefly.Li Qing, a 27-year-old from Guangdong shopping in the area, said: ""Hong Kong is a free city where people can do whatever they want. I understand why they do this, as they think there are too many visitors.""A protest against mainland visitors in Tsim Sha Tsui last month, accusing them of overwhelming the city and hogging its resources, drew condemnation from Beijing and senior officials in Hong Kong, including Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. Few turned up for a second protest in Mong Kok a week later.Tweets by @joannachiu You are signed up. We think you'd also like"	Business

796	"By Houses and Holes in China Economy, Iron ore priceat 12:18 pm on March 10, 2014 | 12 commentsMarkets are not enjoying the China data. From the SMH blog:Shanghai copper has dropped by its 5 per cent daily limit to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country’s first domestic bond default last week.The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has plunged 5 per cent to 46,670 yuan ($US7600) a tonne, its lowest since September 2009.On the Comex in New York, copper futures for delivery in May slid as much as 2.8 per cent to $US2.9955 a pound, the lowest intraday level since June 25, and last traded at $US3.0205 in Tokyo. The metal fell 4.2 per cent on Friday, the biggest drop since December 2011, and dropped 3.3 per cent last week.‘‘It’s a bit of panic selling on concern that China’s demand is slowing,’’ said Kazuhiko Saito, a Tokyo-based analyst at commodities broker Fujitomi. ‘‘China is driving industrial metals lower.’’Remember that Dr Copper, a proxy for global demand, is sitting right on the very key technical level at $3:Dalian iron ore futures are also limit down at 755 or minus 3.9%:And rebar future are down almost as far…China released its Dec QTR data dump last nightChina house prices are out for December and theIn the past week we've seen mounting evidenceWall Street Journal on a theme dear to our heartsOk, but The Kouk said commodity prices are booming and here’s proof:
http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CRY:IND/chartTaunting the Kouk about his infatuation with the CRB index is the primary reason I use twitterhttps://twitter.com/TheKouk/status/442851512193003520So MJV, can you please explain The Kouk’s thinking.  The weightings in the CRB have little relevance to Australia, so why even quote it?  Or does he believe if some commodities are rising, all commodities will follow?  Rising tide lifts all boats etc.I’ve mentioned the lack of relevance to Oz numerous times and he’s just ignored me. (Which is fine because I mainly interact with him for my own amusement.) I have seen him tell someone else that he thinks it’s a good general barometer for the world economy. But that’s a pretty limp argument. Honestly I think with guys like that, they believe that spin matters in economics. If iron ore and coal are both being slaughtered and you keep repeating a line about an irrelevant commodity index rising, you’re able to convince some people for a little while longer that your hyperbull thesis remains intact. But in the end those guys all end up mugged by reality. Now reality has well and truly come a-knocking. He reminds me of Chemical/Comical Ali, bellowing about beating back the crusaders even as American artillery was exploding in the background. The Kouk be insisting on imminent rate rises right up until the first tuesday of whatever month the RBA cuts. Then he’ll tell his hapless fan club why it’s a catastrophic mistake.AUD shrugs it off but NKI225 is off 1% on pretty terrible GDP and Current Account numbers.The Kouk is still pretty cocky…Stephen Koukoulas ‏@TheKouk  1h
The bad Chinese trade news, corporate default, drop in iron ore prices has seen AUD crash to its lowest level since last Thursday #contextLOL last Thursday!Crash? Christ it’s down 40 pips. He seems to have morphed into our opposite man.I think you’re missing the sarcasm #context.It’s actually funnier when you see the sarcasm. He’s suggesting the lack of AUD selling is somehow indicative of something other than a lack of AUD selling.Where to for Chinese industrial production? In the absence of officially-guided spending, the private sector is both unlikely and is in any case too small to take up the slack.The market clearly does not believe the growth targets set at the current parliamentary session will be met.West Australian Treasurer Troy Buswell  has resigned after having a breakdown – snip.skippy… canary’s in mine thing???

It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday.Combined turnover on the two bourses on Friday was 215.84 billion yuan ($35.23 billion), down from Thursday's 222.26 billion yuan.On Friday, oil and nonferrous companies were among the biggest gainers while banks, brokerages, and property developers performed poorly.Shares in Shanxi Securities Co fell by 1.88 percent to 6.77 yuan, and the overall brokerage sector fell by 1.12 percent.The property sector declined by 1.24 percent, led by a fall in the country's two leading real estate companies, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co.News of the default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology worried investors last week.The loss-making solar cell and panel producer announced Wednesday that it would not be able to pay the interest on a loan.

805	"BUSINESS SPECTATORReutersChina's carbon prices surged this week as demand firmed ahead of an upcoming deadline to report 2013 emissions data, indicating the markets may be less over-allocated than feared.Spot permits in four of China's regional pilot emissions trading schemes rose between 5 and 12 per cent this week, although market participants cautioned against reading too much into the numbers as liquidity remained low.""More companies are now coming to the market knowing their positions after calculating their 2013 emissions. This has pushed up the prices,"" a market participant told Reuters.Companies in the markets must report their 2013 carbon dioxide emissions to local regulators by the end of March or April, and then surrender the equivalent number of permits to governments by the end of May or June.In the Shanghai market, permits rose 8.9 per cent over the week to 40.30 yuan ($6.59). Demand mostly came from oil and chemical companies, while major manufacturers and power generators remained on the sidelines, the participant said.In Tianjin, prices shot up by 11.7 per cent to 33.20 yuan, Shenzhen saw a 6.1 per cent rise to 85.80 yuan, while in Beijing, spot permits were at 55.18 yuan, up 5 per cent for the week. The Guangdong market was untraded, as it has been since Dec. 20.This week's price hikes follow stable rates in all regions since the turn of the year.Analysts had feared permit prices would drop due to over-allocation in China's new carbon markets that rely heavily on companies' own emissions data.But volumes traded remained low as many firms have yet to allocate funds to participate in the markets.The Shanghai price rise came on the back of 38,000 permits being traded, while none of the other markets saw more than 6,000 permits change hands on the official exchanges.However, the Beijing Energy and Environment Exchange said on Friday that three deals totalling 42,000 permits at undisclosed prices had been negotiated off the exchange. Companies involved in larger bilateral deals are not required to publish prices.One source said the Shanghai volume was helped by a conference this week where high-level officials urged companies to start trading.The Shenzhen market was launched last June, with the other schemes following in November and December. According to industry analysts, many of the covered companies are yet to come up with strategies on how to deal with climate regulations.The forum will focus on beyond China – Australia’s food opportunity in Southeast Asia, the rise of the home delivery business and Amazon Fresh, animal welfare and the growing importance of social licence to operate in agriculture and the science of food and GMO versus organic food.Tuesday March 27, 2018The Westin Sydney

810	"With insurance penetration rates lower than other international markets, overseas players are keen to get a bigger foothold on the mainlandComments:  Insurers from Hong Kong and other overseas markets are lobbying mainland authorities for permission to sell products in Guangdong province after finding it hard to compete with domestic players, according to industry players.Chan Kin-por, legislator for the insurance sector, told the South China Morning Post that he and some officials from the Office of Commissioner of Insurance recently urged mainland authorities in Qianhai and Guangdong to allow Hong Kong-based insurers to use their Hong Kong agents to sell products to residents there. They also pressed for more flexible product approvals.""Over more than 20 years of development, foreign insurers still find it hard to compete in the mainland insurance market where combined they have less than 4 per cent of the market,"" Chan said, adding that part of the reason was that domestic rivals had more sales agents.He said foreign insurers found it hard to bring their best-selling products to mainland customers.""Unlike Hong Kong where insurers can freely introduce any new insurance products, in China all insurance companies must first get regulatory approval before any new product launch. The regulator does not approve overseas insurers bringing in innovative insurance products to the mainland and that prevents them competing with new products,"" Chan said.Manuel Bauer, a board member of German insurer Allianz, one of the first batch of foreign insurers in 1999, said it would be tough to compete with mainland insurers.""The domestic mainland insurance companies are so dominant that it is a mission impossible for the foreign insurance [company],"" Bauer told the South China Morning Post during a visit to Hong Kong last week.Total gross premiums for foreign insurance companies last year stood at 67.99 billion yuan (HK$86.04 billion), representing only 3.9 per cent of the market, with the rest taken by domestic insurers, according to data from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.Bauer said Allianz would continue to expand on the mainland where it sells a wide range of policies including life, pension, motor insurance and asset management products. The firm's total gross premiums in China rose 30 per cent last year.Despite the low market share, foreign insurers experienced strong growth in mainland sales and future prospects were bright, he said. All foreign life insurance firms in China posted 25.56 per cent growth in premium income last year while all foreign general insurers saw a 23.63 per cent gain in premiums, government statistics showed.""China has a huge population. The country is still in its early stage of development in the insurance market,"" said Bauer. ""Its insurance penetration rate is lower than in other international markets. This provides a lot of room for growth.""Swiss Re said premiums in mainland China in 2012 represented only 2.96 per cent of its gross domestic product, against 8.18 per cent in the United States, 11.27 per cent in Britain, 12.44 per cent in Hong Kong and 18.19 per cent in Taiwan.You are signed up.

	The Standard & Poor's 500 Index starts the week at a record as investors breathed a sigh of relief when the latest US jobs data finally provided evidence of an ongoing recovery in the world's largest economy but clouds are darkening over China.
	The US government's February payrolls report, released on Friday, showed employers added 175,000 jobs, a more generous amount than had been predicted by economists, while January's jobs gain was revised up. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, from 6.6 percent, as more people began looking for work.
	The data cemented expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers will keep reducing the pace of monthly bond purchases, decreased by US$10 billion increments in the most recent two meetings to US$65 billion currently. The Federal Open Market Committee begins its next two-day meeting on March 18.
	Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 1 percent to close at a record on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.65 percent. So far in 2014, the S&P 500 has gained 2 percent, while the Nasdaq has advanced 4.1 percent. The Dow has slipped 0.2 percent.
	Evidence of resilience in the US jobs market reduced the appeal of Treasuries. Bonds fell for the week, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note 14 basis points higher to 2.79 percent.
	The latest US economic data will arrive in the form of the NFIB small business optimism index and whole sale trade, due Tuesday; weekly jobless claims, retail sales, import and export prices, and business inventories, due Thursday; and consumer sentiment, due Friday.
	Today, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser will speak on monetary policy, banks and protectionism in Paris, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will talk on the economy and monetary policy in Columbus, Georgia.
	While investors opted to focus on good news from the US economy last week, concern about the latest developments of the Ukraine crisis and their consequences on financial markets will stay on everyone's radar.
	""Ukraine was a very big deal and created a ton of market volatility and had a huge impact on the stock market,"" Richard Slinn, a San Francisco-based investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank, told Bloomberg News. ""We're watching that closely, but you can't manage portfolios on geopolitical issues.""
	In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index shed 1.5 percent last week. The UK's FTSE 100 dropped 1.1 percent, France's CAC 40 fell 1.2 percent, while Germany's DAX slumped 2 percent.
	Here, economic reports due in the coming days include euro-zone Sentix investor confidence, due today; Germany's trade balance, due Tuesday; euro-industrial production, due Wednesday; and German CPI and euro-zone employment, due Friday.
	Investors remain concerned about a slowdown in the pace of growth in the world's second-largest economy, China. As a result, copper prices have slumped 9 percent this year, the most among 34 commodities tracked by Bloomberg. On Friday, copper futures for delivery in May dropped 4.2 percent to settle at US$3.0825 a pound.
	""Copper is particularly exposed to Chinese issues due to palpably high local stocks and associated financing deals,"" BNP Paribas strategists including Stephen Briggs, said in a report, according to Bloomberg News.
	There was more evidence to support that concern over the weekend. China's exports unexpectedly sank in February, plunging 18.1 percent from a year earlier, according to General Administration of Customs data.
	""February export numbers were a surprise on the downside, and even combined January-February numbers were below market expectations,"" Li Heng, an economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing, told Reuters. ""The data shows that the economy faces relatively big downward pressures and macro-policies need to be loosened a bit.""

Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, customs data showed Saturday, compared with analysts’ median estimate for a 7.5 percent increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July, according to a statistics bureau report Sunday, extending the longest decline since 1999.Distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday and false invoices that inflated trade numbers last year, along with a larger-than-projected increase in imports, make it harder to assess the true picture of global and domestic demand for Chinese goods. Slowing consumer-price gains may give leaders more space to support growth if needed as they gauge the effects of the nation’s first onshore corporate-bond default.“There is an intrinsic inconsistency in their policy target and the reality of the economy,” Liu Li-Gang, head of Greater China economics at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a phone interview. Growth below 7.5 percent in the first half may spur the government to use fiscal stimulus, and “they do have room to do that but by doing so it will compromise China’s economic reform agenda,” he said.                        Inflation TargetPremier Li announced the goal for 2014 gross domestic product growth last week at the opening of the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, a pace unchanged from last year. He also set a target for consumer inflation of about 3.5 percent this year, the same as in 2013, and a goal of 7.5 percent for growth in foreign trade.The consumer price index rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, a 13-month low, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Sunday.China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which last week had its first gain in three weeks, has dropped about 11 percent in the past year. The yuan posted its largest weekly increase since October, following the biggest monthly decline since the government unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.The yuan’s 1.4 percent drop in February may have helped spur the disappearance of over-invoicing, a practice used to disguise capital inflows that plagued trade data in the first four months of last year. Under-invoicing of exports may have occurred in the second half of February to facilitate money outflows, Louis Kuijs, chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Hong Kong, said in a note.                        Complicate PlansImports rose 10.1 percent in February from a year earlier, more than projected, leaving a trade deficit of $23 billion, the biggest in two years, according to customs data.Any weakening of global demand as well as falling prices for manufacturers may complicate plans by Li and President Xi Jinping to carry out the broadest economic-policy shifts since the 1990s while clamping down on debt risks and pollution.Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co., a maker of solar cells, on Friday became the first company to default in China’s onshore bond market after failing to pay full interest due.The coal industry in northern Shanxi province suffered gravely because of a slump in prices last year, Governor Li Xiaopeng said March 6 in Beijing.                         Beverage SalesIn a more positive sign, growth this year at Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co., the largest Chinese beverage maker, is “not too bad” and sales are likely to increase about 20 percent, Chairman Zong Qinghou said Sunday at the NPC meeting.Customs data showed overseas shipments fell 1.6 percent in the first two months from a year earlier. China’s exports to Hong Kong, which diverged last year from the city’s data on imports from the mainland, fell 21 percent, compared with a 61 percent increase in the January-February period of 2013. Chinese regulators in May started a crackdown on practices that inflated trade data.Economists from UBS AG, RBS and Bank of America Corp. estimate exports for January and February combined did expand after taking into account inflated data last year.UBS sees underlying export growth of about 6 percent, while RBS estimates 3.1 percent and Bank of America put the figure at around 7 percent to 8 percent.                    Disappointments Possible“In terms of the underlying momentum, we expect export growth in 2014 to continue to develop favorably,” wrote RBS’s Kuijs, a former World Bank economist. At the same time, the “global recovery is not a steep one and disappointments are possible,” he said.Investors this week will get more details on the economy’s performance as well as the outlook from senior leaders. The statistics bureau will provide data on January-February industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment on March 13. The central bank will publish figures for February credit and money supply by March 15.People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan will give a briefing on March 11 and Premier Li will hold a press conference on March 13.Subdued inflation below the government’s 2014 target will give the central bank more room to ease liquidity and maintain lower money-market interest rates, said Lu Ting, head of Greater China economics at Bank of America in Hong Kong.China’s seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding availability in the banking system, averaged 3 percent last week, down from 4.98 percent at the end of January.“The low CPI inflation could be good news for markets as monetary tightening is definitely not justified,” Lu said in a note Sunday. “Lower and more stable interbank rates should be supportive of delivering a stable GDP growth.”

816	"Stock markets in the Chinese mainland ended the week with a fall on Friday, amid concerns over China's first corporate bond market default.The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index nudged down by 1.67 points or 0.08 percent to 2,057.91 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 0.08 percent from the previous Friday, February 28. The Shenzhen Component Index slid by 23.55 points or 0.32 percent to 7,328.48 points on Friday. It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday. Combined turnover on the two bourses on Friday was 215.84 billion yuan ($35.23 billion), down from Thursday's 222.26 billion yuan. On Friday, oil and nonferrous companies were among the biggest gainers while banks, brokerages, and property developers performed poorly.  Shares in Shanxi Securities Co fell by 1.88 percent to 6.77 yuan, and the overall brokerage sector fell by 1.12 percent. The property sector declined by 1.24 percent, led by a fall in the country's two leading real estate companies, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co.  News of the default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology worried investors last week.The loss-making solar cell and panel producer announced Wednesday that it would not be able to pay the interest on a loan. The interest payment of 89.8 million yuan was due on Friday. The company became the first domestic company in the corporate bond market to default. It was seen as an indicator that more similar defaults may follow. Despite the potential boost for stock markets from policy announcements at the ongoing annual two sessions - the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference - investors remained cautious last week. ""Investors may be concerned about economic data, property and credit risks,"" said a research note sent by Shenyin & Wanguo Securities on Friday.   ChiNext, China's NASDAQ-style board for high-tech and fast-growing start-ups listed in Shenzhen, declined by 1.92 points or 0.13 percent to 1,460.61 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 1.79 percent from the previous Friday. "	Business
817	"Shanghaiist is a website about Shanghai  Hong Kong has experienced a notable increase in the number of young mainland Chinese women marrying elderly Hong Kong men to obtain residency, and in many cases, housing. The South China Morning Post cites the Hong Kong Social Welfare Department reporting an increase in the number of documented elderly abuse cases, from 589 in 2013, 408 in 2012, and a mere 368 from 2011-2010. More specifically, Against Elderly Abuse, a Hong Kong welfare agency, noted a trend of Chinese women in their thirties from Hubei and Hunan provinces marrying public tenants “over 60 years old living on welfare,” and cautioned such men to “use caution” as such marriages often turn out “too good to be true.”The eagerness of some elderly Hong Kong men to walk down the aisle with much younger Chinese women seems to be against the grain in terms of overall Hong Kongers’ distaste for Chinese, but in line with cross-border male preferences for younger female partners.

Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange have climbed for eight straight weeks, the longest streak in two years adding to signs of slowing use.”Prices have lost 9.2% this year, the most among 34 commodities tracked by Bloomberg, as signs of faltering growth in China boosted the outlook for a surplus. Global production will outpace demand by 81,000 tonnes in 2014, after a deficit of 175,000 tonnes last year.Mr Tom Power senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago said that “You have a lot of fear in the market right now.

822	"WASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday launched an effort to encourage issuers and underwriters of municipal securities to self-report certain violations of the federal securities laws rather than wait for their violations to be detected.Under the Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative, the SEC's Enforcement Division's Municipal Securities and Public Pension unit will recommend favorable settlement terms for muni issuers and underwriters who voluntarily report that there were inaccurate statements in bond documents about their prior compliance with continuing disclosure obligations. Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires underwriters to reasonably determine that an issuer will comply with its continuing disclosure agreement before underwriting any new municipal securities. The rule also requires new offering documents to include descriptions of any continuing disclosure violations in the past five years.""The Enforcement Division is committed to using innovative methods to uncover securities law violations and improve transparency in the municipal markets,"" said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the Enforcement Division. ""We encourage eligible parties to take advantage of the favorable terms we are offering under this initiative. Those who do not self-report and instead decide to take their chances can expect to face increased sanctions for violations.""The SEC has repeatedly indicated it is paying stricter attention to whether issuers are living up to their disclosure agreements and whether underwriters are doing their due diligence in making sure of that. Last year an SEC probe examined underwriters in California, and a July 2013 enforcement action targeted both West Clark Community Schools in Clark County, Ind. and Indianapolis-based City Securities Corp. with falsely claiming in bond documents that the issuer was meeting its secondary market disclosure obligations when it was not.""Continuing disclosures are a critical source of information for investors in municipal securities, and offering documents should accurately disclose issuers' prior compliance with their disclosure obligations,"" said LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, chief of the Enforcement Division's Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. ""This initiative is designed to promote improved compliance by encouraging responsible behavior by market participants who have failed to meet their obligations in the past.""Bond Dealers of America president and chief executive officer Mike Nicholas said the SEC goal is sound but the details of the new program will have to be carefully examined.""The BDA supports the SEC's goal toward self-reporting of violations to the extent an obvious violation of the securities law has occurred,"" Nicholas said. ""We caution that there may be disproportionate administrative, reporting and other burdens on underwriters via the settlement obligation requirements and we will be examining those in more detail in the coming days.""Ben Watkins, Florida's bond finance director and the chair of the Government Finance Officers Association's debt management committee, said the new program isn't likely to provide much incentive for issuers to step forward.""I don't see it,"" Watkins said, adding that issuers would probably end up with a cease-and-desist order whether they self-report or get caught by SEC investigators.John McNally, a lawyer at Hawkins, Delafield & Wood LLP, said the SEC's announcement underscores a point the commission has already made. McNally said that the investigations currently being done by underwriters of an issuer's filing history are very comprehensive, and pointed out that the SEC issued a release in June 2010 warning underwriters that they should be diligent about looking into an issuer's filing history. The West Clark case made issuers sit up and take notice as well, McNally said.""The SEC has already advised issuers and underwriters of their concerns, and all parties are paying careful attention to such advice,"" he said."

824	"By Newsroom America Feeds at 10 Mar 2014
	The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a new cooperation initiative out of its Enforcement Division to encourage issuers and underwriters of municipal securities to self-report certain violations of the federal securities laws rather than wait for their violations to be detected.

	“The Enforcement Division is committed to using innovative methods to uncover securities law violations and improve transparency in the municipal markets,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the SEC Enforcement Division.  “We encourage eligible parties to take advantage of the favorable terms we are offering under this initiative.  Those who do not self-report and instead decide to take their chances can expect to face increased sanctions for violations.”

	Under the Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation (MCDC) Initiative, the Enforcement Division will recommend standardized, favorable settlement terms to municipal issuers and underwriters who self-report that they have made inaccurate statements in bond offerings about their prior compliance with continuing disclosure obligations specified in Rule 15c2-12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

	Rule 15c2-12 generally prohibits underwriters from purchasing or selling municipal securities unless the issuer has committed to providing continuing disclosure regarding the security and issuer, including information about its financial condition and operating data.  The rule also generally requires that municipal bond offering documents contain a description of any instances in the previous five years in which the issuer failed to comply, in all material respects, with any previous commitment to provide such continuing disclosure.

	“Continuing disclosures are a critical source of information for investors in municipal securities, and offering documents should accurately disclose issuers’ prior compliance with their disclosure obligations,” said LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit.  “This initiative is designed to promote improved compliance by encouraging responsible behavior by market participants who have failed to meet their obligations in the past.”

	The SEC can file enforcement actions against municipal issuers for making misrepresentations in bond offerings about their prior compliance with continuing disclosure obligations. Underwriters for such bond offerings also can be liable for failing to exercise adequate due diligence regarding the truthfulness of representations in the issuer’s official statement.  For instance, the SEC recently charged a school district in Indiana and its underwriter with falsely stating to investors that it had been properly providing annual financial information and notices required as part of its prior bond offerings. 

	Eligibility for the MCDC Initiative is explained in a detailed announcement by the Enforcement Division.  Issuers and underwriters must self-report by completing a questionnaire and submitting it via e-mail or by fax or mail no later than Sept. 10, 2014.

	The MCDC Initiative is being led by Peter K.M. Chan, an assistant director in the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit and the Chicago Regional Office.http://www.sec.gov/servlet/Satellite/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370541090828

825	Reuters Staff2 Min ReadWASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Federal regulators on Monday said U.S. municipal issuers and underwriters who self-report inaccurate statements they have made in bond documents will likely receive standardized, favorable settlement terms under a new initiative. “We encourage eligible parties to take advantage of the favorable terms we are offering under this initiative,” Andrew Ceresney, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division, said in a statement. “Those who do not self-report and instead decide to take their chances can expect to face increased sanctions for violations.” Under the initiative an issuer such as a city or an underwriter could come forward to say it had put wrong information in continuing disclosures, or failed to include important information about its financial condition and operations. When issuers sell new bonds, they are supposed to describe in sale documents any instances within the previous five years when they did not comply with federal requirements to give material information to investors. Underwriters are supposed to ensure that they follow through. The Tower Amendment, which prevents the SEC from requiring issuers to file bond sale documents with it before bringing the securities to market, limits the SEC’s ability to enforce securities law in the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market. But it can rap underwriters and issuers for committing fraud in their bond documents. In the last year and a half, the commission has ramped up its efforts and charged cities, school districts and even a state for not disclosing important information. “Continuing disclosures are a critical source of information for investors in municipal securities, and offering documents should accurately disclose issuers’ prior compliance with their disclosure obligations,” LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, said in the same statement.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

. While exiting those merchandise has hurt gross margin in the fourth quarter, Chen said he doesn’t expect discontinued labels to continue to hurt first-quarter margin. He sees “significant” improvement in margin this year.jcpYour browser does not support iframes.Meanwhile, the company’s home merchandise, the worst performing section under Johnson that had declined to 12% of sales in 2012 from nearly 20% in 2008, may also get a boost as Penney overhauls the segment. The analyst said merchandising changes in the kids’ department also will be a boost.Penney “isn’t taking substantial fashion risk but just going back to what worked before and marketing to drive prudent traffic,” Chen said, adding investors’ fears on the company’s liquidity position “are overdone.” He said he sees the company to end the year with $2 billion liquidity, in line with company projection. “Achieving (first quarter) and (fiscal year) guidance will mitigate investor fear on liquidity concerns and drive profitability and the stock higher.”– Follow Andria on Twitter @AndriaCheng

837	"Could JC Penney be on the verge of a turnaround? It has seen no shortage of bad news in the years since the financial crisis -- including a weak 2013 holiday season, a boot from the S&P 500 and a below-$10 stock price that was once closer to $80 a share -- but according to Citi analyst Oliver Chen, brighter days are on their way. Chen upgraded the beleaguered retailer's rating from neutral to a buy Tuesday morning, sending JC Penney stock surging 7.5% in pre-market activity.In upgrading JC Penney from a neutral to a buy, Citi raised the retailer's price target up from $8.42 to $11, a level the stock hasn't seen since September 2013. ""We’re upgrading JCP to buy based on our conviction that JCP can continue to deliver positive comp store sales in-line with fiscal 2014 guidance,"" Chen writes in the report. ""We believe this can happen as JCP fixes home, focuses on restocking basics & private branded product, and edits out inappropriate merchandise.""That guidance, provided in the company's fourth quarter earnings results released last month, included a full-year comparable store sales increase in the mid single digits, a ""significantly"" improved gross margin and liquidity in excess of $2 billion at year-end. Focusing just on 2014's first fiscal quarter, JC Penney said in February that it expects a first quarter comparable store sales increase between 3% and 5% with depreciation and amortization totaling $155 million.Chen acknowledged that JC Penney still has a long way to go -- and indeed, the company reported a $1.4 billion net loss for full-year 2013 -- but added that he and his team ""like the risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes will support guidance for growth in 2014.""
He added that the  ""Street doesn’t believe JCP can generate positive comp store sales, but we do.""  In Citi's view, the growth will be driven by the home and kid categories, which account for 20% to 25% of JC Penney's business mix. If the combined categories can comp 20%, it yields a 5% benefit for the company overall. Citi sees reason for optimism in these areas almost purely due to the fact that Ron Johnson is no longer the company's CEO.""In our view, not so good decisions made under former CEO Ron Johnson considerably impacted performance in 2013. The home department was the major tailwind in the first half of the year, while trouble in kids from a merchandise point of view was the tailwind in the second half of the year,"" Chen wrote. Looking ahead, this should translate into better comparisons in 2014, Chen said, noting that in correcting Johnson's mistakes in the home category -- mistakes that included a pricing overhaul, a new shop environment and new partners -- JC Penney's home goods segment has regained momentum. ""Although management noted that 'fixing home has been a challenge,' customers have responded positively to the changes, with home up in the fourth quarter,"" Chen wrote.It's worth noting that Citi's new, bullish stance is a bit of a return to tradition -- though not nearly as bullish at it was in the past. Now-former Citi analyst Deborah Weinswig gave the retailer a $28 price target in 2012, writing at the time that “J.C. Penney is clearly not out of ammo, as it showcased a dazzling display of technology, outgunning the competition."" However, a year later Weinswig had changed her mind, downgrading the stock to a sell in September and predicting that its price would fall to $7 per share -- a prediction that came to fruition little more than than one month later.Following Citi's upgrade, shares of JC Penney surged 7.5% in Tuesday's pre-market trading and are now up 8.6% -- and climbing -- in the early part of Tuesday's regular trading session."

J.C. Penney Co., the retailer that’s posted three straight annual losses, rose as much as 8.9 percent in early trading after a Citigroup Inc. analyst recommended buying the shares because of its nascent turnaround.The stock climbed as high as $9.17 as 8:15 a.m. in New York. Shares of Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney had dropped 8 percent this year through Monday, compared with a 1.6 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.The department-store chain’s 2 percent gain in fourth- quarter comparable-store sales “bodes well” for continued sales momentum, Citigroup’s Oliver Chen said in a note raising his rating to buy. If J.C. Penney can meet first-quarter and full-year forecasts, that would reduce concerns that the company doesn’t have sufficient liquidity and would drive the stock higher, he said.J.C. Penney “is early in this go-forward phase but we like the risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes will support guidance for growth in 2014,”the New York- based analyst said in the note.

840	"Convinced that J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) has already turned a corner under the improved management of CEO Myron Ullman, Citi analyst Oliver Chen upgraded the company from Neutral/High Risk to Buy/High Risk and pushed his price target to $11 from $7.50 with an implied 30% upside. The markets responded immediately, and JCP stock was up 9.6% after just a few hours of trading.Chen’s thesis rests on the idea that J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s recent pain is a result of poor decisions made by former CEO Ron Johnson who was pushed out last April, and that weak comps for the rest of 2013 were caused by Ullman accepting the short-term pain necessary to make long-term changes.“Not so good decisions made under former CEO Ron Johnson, considerably impacted performance in 2013. The Home department was the major tailwind in 1H of the year, while trouble in Kids from a merchandise point of view was the tailwind in 2H,” writes Chen.J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) has been struggling for years, and short interest hit 30% of total float earlier this year, so the upgrade goes strongly against what most investors expect and seems to have triggered a serious reassessment.Changes to the home division, which had been underperforming for years, cut J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s floor space by about 10% nationwide during 1H13 and impacted sales in other departments as construction drove people away. But the changes seem to have worked, and Home finally increased during 4Q13. During 2H13 the Kids department was forced to make do with less floor space as management tried new ideas that didn’t pan out. Chen believes that simply reallocating more resources to Kids and solid follow through will be enough to meet 2014 guidance if other departments hold steady.Additionally, J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) is returning to its historic mix of private labels (50% versus 30% under Johnson) whose margins can be as much as 500 bps higher than comparable national brands. At the same time, J.C. Penney has eliminated a number of private brands that were underperforming (JCP Men’s, Stafford Prep, JOE by Joseph Abboud, William Rast, Joe Fresh Kids and JCP Everyday) and reduced a few others so that it can focus on the private brands that have proven to attract customers. Eliminating those brands forced J.C. Penney to take a one-off 190 bp gross margin hit (though it still improved 460 bps overall), but Chen expects to see strong margin improvement this year.enter your info below & be subscribed to bothvaluewalk & valueinvestor.com (from ValueWalk)

842	"J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) is still struggling, and losing market share to rivals. Imperial Capital analysts Mary Ross-Gilbert and Seweryn Sztalkoper said that the company’s remerchandised home department sales should rise this year. J.C. Penney’s revenues from home merchandise have declined from $3.19 billion in 2010 to about $950 million in 2013. That’s because the home departments in most of the big stores were closed. Even when the departments were reopened, they were poorly merchandised.Imperial Capital analysts estimate J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s first quarter sales to rise 4.3%, and second quarter revenues to jump 6.4%. After recent discussions with the company management, Ross-Gilbert and Sztalkoper said that J.C. Penney’s incremental revenue opportunity could be as high as $400-$500 million this year. So, the comparable sales momentum is likely to improve in 2014 due to a jump in sales of home merchandise. Even a modest increase in sales across the rest of the store should offset the decline in revenue due to closure of 33 stores.J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) forecasts its first quarter sales to grow between 3-5%, and full year revenues to increase in mid-single digits. That’s well below Imperial Capital’s estimate of 8.7% and 6.6% respectively. Lower Q1 guidance could be because of two reasons. One, harsh winter weather and storms caused temporary store closures, and kept consumers away. Two, not-so-high expectations from the home department. The analysts expect gross margins to rise 268 basis points to 34.5% in Q1. They forecast Q2 and Q3 gross margins to improve to 37.5% and 36.5% respectively.Modestly positive comparable sales during the fourth quarter last year suggest that J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s turnaround is gaining traction. The Plano, Texas-based company’s current cash position of $1.25 billion in cash and $500 million of revolver availability are sufficient to fund its turnaround plan. J.C. Penney also has the ability to tap into secured financing of $500 million. The research firm says that it expects J.C. Penney to survive in the long-term as a “value-priced’ department store chain serving low-income consumers.Imperial Capital has a Buy rating on J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s longer-dated senior notes that mature between 2020 and 2097. But the research firm maintains Hold rating on shorter-dated senior notes that mature between 2015 and 2018. It has an Underperform rating on the company’s shares with $2.50 price target.J.C. Penney Company, Inc.

J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.By Jon C. Ogg"	Business

At the time, CEO Mike Ullman said the company’s lengthy turnaround was gaining momentum.In its most recent quarter, Penney posted same-store sales, a key growth metric of sales at stores open longer than a year, of 2%, which Citi says bodes well for continued momentum and share gains.However, it’s important to note that Citi is so far among Wall Street’s more bullish on Penney.Among the 26 analysts currently watching Penney, just three have a “buy” rating. A majority are urging investors to “hold,” while eight are encouraging clients to “sell,” according to the most recent data from Thomson Reuters.  Click the button below to comment on this article.Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

1. According to Zacks Investment Research, ""Citigroup’s shares outperformed the Zacks categorized Major Regional Banks industry over the last six months. We believe that the company’s restructuring and streamlining efforts, strategic investments in core business and expense management, should support profitability, going forward. Recent Fed's approval to the company's 2017 capital plan also remain encouraging. Moreover, recently approved the Financial Choice Act will act as a tailwind for the company in coming quarters. However, several issues including litigation burden keep us apprehensive. Moreover, inspite of rising rates, margin is under pressure."" (7/7/2017)
2. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts commented, ""potential positives"" in the U.S. such as lower tax rates, faster growth and higher interest rates — while also having greater exposure to ""downside scenarios.""However, UBS's Saul Martinez upgraded Citi's stock rating from Sell to Neutral with a price target raised from $58 to $64 as the arguments for the prior bearish stance ""is harder to make today"" (check out Saul Martinez's track record).Economic growth across Europe and major emerging markets has at the very least stabilized or even risen, the analyst argued. Meanwhile, ""starkly"" protectionist policies have not emerged which bodes well for the industry as a whole.

3. UBS Group AG analysts commented, ""potential positives"" in the U.S. such as lower tax rates, faster growth and higher interest rates — while also having greater exposure to ""downside scenarios.""However, UBS's Saul Martinez upgraded Citi's stock rating from Sell to Neutral with a price target raised from $58 to $64 as the arguments for the prior bearish stance ""is harder to make today"" (check out Saul Martinez's track record).Economic growth across Europe and major emerging markets has at the very least stabilized or even risen, the analyst argued. Meanwhile, ""starkly"" protectionist policies have not emerged which bodes well for the industry as a whole.

854	"An investment report released March 6th by Steven Ruggiero of R.W. Pressprich & Co. focuses on J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP). The report highlights both the stock and debt offerings of the venerable and currently beleaguered retailer, rating the stock as a Market Perform and the senior unsecured notes as a Buy.The report is largely focused on the positive prospects for J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) debt offerings. Ruggiero highlights several positive developments in the companies recent and near-future financial numbers. “We reiterate our “BUY” recommendation for the JCP senior unsecured notes. We have increased our FY14 and FY15 estimated adjusted EBITDA to $112 million and $476 million, respectively.”The R.W. Pressprich & Co. reports projects the firm will be “modestly Free Cash Flow negative in fiscal 2014 and 2015, but see upside potential in our earnings/cash flow model. Free Cash Flow is projected at ($57) million and ($124) million in FY14 and FY15, respectively.” Ruggiero also notes that these projections do not include asset sales.Last but not least, Ruggiero also focuses on the possibility, or from his perspective, the likelihood, of J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) undertaking debt refinancing within a year or so. “We continue to expect that JCP will have sufficient financial flexibility to refinance its 6.875% Senior Notes due 10/15/15. Further, we would not be surprised if the Company refinances its 7.65% Debentures due 8/15/16 at the same time as it takes out its 2015 maturity. We think that a first half 2015 refinancing is possible.”enter your info below & be subscribed to bothvaluewalk & valueinvestor.com (from ValueWalk)

855	"In a note released Monday, Imperial Capital voiced concerns that J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) may need to “issue additional equity to pay down debt or eventually restructure.” Analyst Mary Ross-Gilbert maintains an Underperform rating and $2.50 price target on the shares, but also maintained a Buy rating on J.C. Penney bonds maturing 2020-2097.Ross-Gilbert recommends that investors “hedge a long [bond ] position by shorting the shares and/or the shorter-dated bonds.” Longer-dated bonds “create the company at 33% of revenues (43% excluding excess cash), which compares favorably to other major departments store retailers trading in the 43%-92% range,” says the analyst.The Imperial analyst believes “debt leverage would be nearly 10x, potentially requiring a restructuring unless JCP raises additional equity.” Ross-Gilbert views this as a possibility based on “anticipated positive operating momentum.”Shares of J.C. Penney were up 0.69 percent in premarket trading to $8.74. Shares are up 72 percent since February 4.

			March 11th, 2014		DigitalGlobe, the Longmont, CO-based satellite imagery provider, has once again turned to the crowd to help analyze its images as part of a disaster recovery effort, this time for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared Saturday.DigitalGlobe is participating in the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared Saturday while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing. The Boeing 777 jetliner was carrying 239 people.For the search, DigitalGlobe is using its Tomnod platform, which crowdsources the analysis of satellite photos. Tomnod posts images and allows users to scan and tag features and landmarks. In this case, users would be looking for debris.Xconomy ran a story on Tomnod in November, when the company used it to evaluate damage in the Philippines in the wake of Super Typhoon Haiyan.According to the company’s blog, two of Digital Globe’s satellites on Sunday collected images of a 3,200-square-kilometer area in the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea where the plane may have disappeared. The company has since expanded its search area as Malaysian authorities widen their search.The story about DigitalGlobe’s involvement in the search was first reported in the Denver Post.By posting a comment, you agree to our terms and conditions.please give us a larger area to search, they could be on either side of Malaysia…I HOPE WE CAN FIND IT SOONGood luck getting on this thing it is crashed just like the planewhat is this… im trying to help.. and the server just crashedI would suggest that the slow loading times are more a result of unusually heavy usage due to people helping in the search. Another factor may be the image details adding to download speeds. All-in-all, this is a great service.I”ve been trying to get online (off and on) for an hour and a half but it won’t let me on. I was able to set up an account but after that the map wouldn’t load. I WANT TO LOOK TOO!! I have an idea where the plane might be.Yes not working for me as well. Very upsetting! Has been down all day I believe. I just get blank page, all blue with tomnod logo on top left and DigitalGlobe logo on bottom right, nothing else! I think the pilot is in on it. And that plane is most likely in another therd world country by now.. The gov and cia no were it is…I see a blue square, no images at all??????do you have the current version of Java, I had to update mineLike they said there are two passports on there that aren’t those people… It might be in another country and it’s being made into a weapon and used on a countryis it working for anyoneI THINK I FOUND SOMETHING ON MAP 21962 LOWER RIGHT CORNER OF MAP TWO ANOMALYS. ONE JUST BELOW A CLOUD AND THE OTHER 45 DEGREES SOUTH WEST OF THE FIRST. ABOUT AN INCH  FROM THE RIGHT HAND CORNER.post a screenshot. so hard to find these.I saw it too. Also 2 grids that had very pink looking clouds. The result of an explosion perhaps?any way to zoom?I see somethin like boat i guess on MAP 24091.Check this out guys and let me know what do you think ??http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014/map/24091i see it, its on MAP 21651? wish there was a way to zoomYes Eva, its on 21651post a screenshot.here is the screen shoti found that too, loos the the airplane headokay, either there are a lot of 100 ft. long fishing boats on this grid or we have all found something. Wondering if the media or anyone will ever be mentioning this again. They seem quite slow to confirm or deny anything.CheckOutmap/155841looks like an airplane slide raftthats a ship for sure.. here is a plane-> http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014/map/53863CheckOut map/155841 looks like an airplane slide raftSo hard to see anything because of their setup. I seem to have found 3 items very similar myself.Have a look at maps 23985 & 21669,21054 if you find one of these go direct north or direct south a few maps within the same gridwhat about MAP 6060What’s that? http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014/map/21669here is something: http://prntscr.com/304ol7tell me how the grid is numbered? I can’t find any of the ones you commented on. or take a screenshot. pleaseHas anyone thought about a Missile taking down this plane? This is way to
strange-I still don’t think they are looking in the right place-the plane could have
gone another couple of hundred miles in either directions if it was on auto pilot?https://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/14/rush-limbaugh-crazy-theory-malaysian-aircraft-shot.htmlSlow loading speed: As I mentioned early on, the maps appear to load very slowly, even via my higher speed cable pipeline. As long as you are logged in & can see a message: “Map Loading” in the lower right corner, the system is working. Maps tend to load in small squares of info with hundreds of squares making up your search grid. You may have to just walk away from the machine for a while while they load. Once the grid is fully loaded, I’ve found it’s easiest to begin at one corner and scroll up or down one screen at a time, searching the screen before moving up or down to next view. Once you hit the top or bottom, scroll right or left one screen, then repeat in opposite direction. It’s a lot like mowing a lawn or stepping through a sort of “swim lane” search grid.I don’t mean to sound really terrible but I don’t get how this is helping.  I’ve tried to get on many times over the last 24 hours and only have been to actually get on twice.  I can’t get back to where my tags are, the images are now 3 days old, and there are large areas that were cloud covered.  I’m still going to keep trying for a while longer but I think it was a good idea that needs to be more accessible and relevant.What could this be?http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014/map/24066Looks like 2 ships.  The sire crashed yesterday but is working todayCould we check any of the abandoned airbases in Iran?  There is a runway north west of Konarak suitable for landing large aircraft.  A novice with only simulator experience could locate it by easily visible landmarks.I think what might have happen is that some how the Coder was taken out by someone and they threw it in the water.So that might the answer why there is no debri in the water. i just Pray for the BEST for the MANY FAMILIES that have love ones that is aboard the plane. MAY GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO IS INVOLVED
.Best of luckIs there a way to go to a certain coordinate on tomnod?This was a great idea but the site loads slowly, there are no instructions, the features don’t always work, the images are days old, trying to coordinate with other searchers on social media and look at their posted maps is impossible, and I just don’t see how this could possibly be a valuable tool that so few people can use and/or know how to use. Even questions posted on twitter were not answered.   I found zoom in/out by accident and never was able to go back to the tags I had made.  Best of luck to future searchers.i thing i find an object in map 24091Please provide full coverage (new extent – radius of 2000
miles from KL ) as per new search – Bay of Bengal , Male island , Maldives,  luccadive sea ,Andaman sea , gulf of Thailand
, Malacca Strait. The satellites images should cover sea and land if possible.I found a plane as well.. Dont know if its down..in flight or what. But it looks like a ‘prop’ plane..But i’m no expert.clicky -> http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014/map/53863Please have a look at maps 24306 of the oil rig then go direct I think south to map 23985 of two objects. what do you think.Two other maps that are in the direct south direction are 21669 and map 21054Nothing loads. Shame, I wanted to help.Map 125464 – I found a lot of debrisSee pick and tagsSame map different viewI seriously need to know if someone is really looking/reading through the comments here? is this map updated or live? I need help on getting some Maps and this is serious!The map I am referring to was taken by digital globe wed 3/12 at 3:58am – can you see the pic I’m sharing?Thank you for your prompt response. Where is this map pointing to? I need to know briefly from which location to which location…If i need a map for a specific location.. is that possible?Not sure – You might try to contact info@tomnod.com to get that info.Thanks bud for putting me on the rite direction.. hope i get a positive response from them….Map 120620 definitely looks like it http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014/map/120620Looks like a boat.

But no answer yet from Tomnod if they looked at it.I see it too, I pulled the latitude and longitude for that location, it’s: 11.577303,92.680922 Nayashahar RV, Andaman and Nicobar Islands 744105

Something weird here.I see what may be a plane and wreckage around the same generalized area on Map #592161, #592929, #589882 debris and possible body…not sure….possible wing #584036, #592415 debris, #584534, #596722 not sure what it is…..This is a 777 (imagery captured sun 3/9/2014 4.12am):http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014/map/637975It could be “the” plane yet in flight? Is the imagery date compatible?Could be a 757, they look very similar and the Malaysian 777 took off just after midnight on 3/8/2014 so no way it had the fuel to still be airborne.Map 654342 could be the most possible one: http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014/map/654342Well NO ONE from Tomnod will get back to me on this map. I wonder at times is this site is really working?Very interesting formation in this area as if you could see all the parts of a plane.. I look very close at it and it is not clouds, something is in the water..  http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/mh370_indian_ocean/map/16495WOW seems 90% of the time Tomnod will not load at all.. Wants to crash all the time.. FIX THE SITE so we can help!!!  Please!Maps 281317, 280142, and 27127 from 3/17/2014 need to be reviewed ASAP. If tomnod would go to there grid map on 3/15/2014 at 4:10am utc map #126974 you might see something interesting there. Nobody is checking it out FBI and CNN might be surprised I contacted both. I found it but tomnod won’t send me back to 3/15/2014 at 4:10am to map #126974.Please check out map 915192 and adjoining 900062 as there are appears to be large pieces of debris up to 25m long.

858	Update March 12, 11 a.m.: Yesterday DigitalGlobe saw an “unprecedented level of web traffic and interest in supporting the search,” and Tomnod said their new satellite “images (were) captured around 10:30am local time.”Malaysian authorities expanded the search area for Flight 370 to the Straight of Malacca, one of the “most heavily traveled waterways in the entire world,” a U.S. Navy 7th Fleet spokesman said yesterday.—At least 250 tons of evidence from Malasyia Flight 370 should be out there somewhere. Two hundred and 39 people, parts of the plane, suitcases, seat cushions that are supposed to float — it just seems that something, even the smallest shred of evidence, must be out there waiting to be spotted.At least, that’s the thinking behind the DigitalGlobe effort; the aerial imaging company has fixed their orbiting satellite cameras on the Gulf of Thailand and surrounding regions where the missing Boeing 777 was last tracked.The Colorado-based company says crowdsourcing the search is the best solution to finding clues. By making their high-resolution images available to the public, potentially hundreds of thousands of eyes can inspect the search areas and help to look for yet-unspotted traces of the flight.“For people who aren’t able to drive a boat through the Pacific Ocean to get to the Malaysian peninsula, or who can’t fly airplanes to look there, this is a way that they can contribute and try to help out,” Luke Barrington, senior manager of Geospatial Big Data for DigitalGlobe, told ABC News.The images being gathered will be made available for free to the public on a website called Tomnod. Anyone can click on the link and begin searching the images, tagging anything that looks suspicious. Each pixel on a computer screen represents half a meter on the ocean’s surface, Barrington said.According to ABC, DigitalGlobe will use a computer algorithm to determine whether users start tagging certain regions more than others. In-house satellite imaging experts will follow up on leads, Barrington said.“We’ll say, ‘Here are our top ten suspicious or interesting locations,’” Barrington said. “Is it really an aircraft wing that’s been chopped in half or is this some other debris floating on the ocean? We may not be 100 percent sure, but if this is where I had to go pick a location to go looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I’d start.”DigitalGlobe has used this technique to assess damage after other natural or manmade disasters, including the tornado that leveled the Plaza Elementary School in Moore, Okla., and the devastating damage to Seaside Heights, N.J. after Superstorm Sandy.“In many cases the areas are so large or the things are are looking for are so hard to find that without the help of hundreds of thousands of people online we’d never be able to find them,” Barrington said.(H/T: ABC News)—Follow Elizabeth Kreft (@elizabethakreft) on TwitterApproved posts to MyVoice will be live on the site within a few hours.

												LONGMONT, Colo. — A Longmont-based earth-imagery company is asking computer users to scan and tag images of more than 1,200 square miles of ocean for any visible evidence that could help locate the Malaysia Airlines 777 aircraft that went missing this weekend.The Denver Post reports that DigitalGlobe has directed two of its satellites to snap photos of areas in the Gulf of Thailand, where investigators suspect the plane may have crashed. The company is asking the public to report any evidence of a crash.Flight MH370, with 239 people on board, lost communication while on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. The missing plane continues to perplex investigators.Within the first hour Monday, the company map had 60,000 page views. The findings are available to authorities.

	Could YOU help solve the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?
	Netizens are being called on to analyze high-res satellite images of the ocean's surface in a bid to spot any sign of the missing Beijing-bound airliner.
	Colorado firm DigitalGlobe has trained its cameras from five satellites on the area in the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea where the craft, carrying 239 passengers, was last heard from.
	It has uploaded the snaps to the Tomnod website - and wants crowdsourcers to scan the pictures, where each pixel equals half a meter, and tag anything that looks suspicious.
	Algorithms will then determine which areas have the most tags, and in-house experts will follow up on any interesting leads.
	""For people who aren't able to drive a boat through the Pacific Ocean [...], this is a way they can help out,"" DigitalGlobe senior manager Luke Barrington told ABC News.
	And once locations have been identified, he added: ""We may not be 100% sure, but if this is where I had to go pick a location looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I'd start.""
	It's not the first time Longmont-based DigitalGlobe has been involved with crowdsourcing campaigns during disasters, ABC News has noted.

			Trending:		DigitalGlobe is enlisting the crowd to scan and tag images  of more than 1,200 square miles of ocean for  any visible evidence that could help locate the Malaysia Airlines 777 aircraft that went missing this weekend. The Longmont-based earth-imagery company deployed its FirstLook service on Sunday, directing two of its five satellites to snap photos of the area in the Gulf of Thailand, where investigators suspected the plane may have crashed, and then activated its  crowdsourcing platform, Tomnod, on Monday afternoon. Flight MH370, with 239 people  on board, lost communication while on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. The missing plane continued to perplex investigators from around the globe three days later. “If there is something to see on the surface (of the water), we will see it. But the question is if we are looking in the right area,” said Luke Barrington, DigitalGlobe’s senior manager of geospatial big data. As each new theory  led to a new dead end, the company recalibrated its action plan based on the Malaysian government’s new area of focus, north and east of oil slicks reported soon after the plane went missing.
DigitalGlobe activates FirstLook —  used by emergency-response agencies in natural disasters, manmade crises and human interest scenarios —  about twice a week, while Tomnod is used more selectively and for different reasons, Barrington said. “We try to use the crowd wisely and not tire them out,” he said. “The story here is much more about the search than it is about the response. This whole feeling of not knowing, the lack of information or ability to do anything, we have seen time and again, is why people want to get involved.”Within the first hour Monday afternoon, the Tomnod map had 60,000 page views with more than a thousand tags. Ten minutes later, that was up to nearly 2,000. Barrington said that the crowd actually directed the company on this particular crisis, asking for them to deploy Tomnod. “The people who come to Tomnod are very motivated  to solve problems,” Barrington said. “I would say we will have up to 10,000 contributors on this one.”DigitalGlobe is not the only earth-imagery company capable of delivering high-resolution images, but is arguably the U.S. industry leader.“There are an awful lot of assets up in orbit,” said Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at The Teal Group. “There’s dozens of earth observation satellites and all of them are very, very capable. If they are taking images, then there’s no lack of imagery. And if you haven’t been able to spot something by now, then I don’t know. It has been three days.”Kristen Leigh Painter: 303-954-1638, kpainter@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kristenpainter"	Business

Hours after Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers disappeared off the coast of Malaysia on 8 March, DigitalGlobe had repositioned its high-resolution satellite constellation to capture as much data as possible. On Monday, it posted those images on crowdsourcing platform Tomnod and had 60,000 page views within an hour. It did so at the bequest of the crowd, which came to DigitalGlobe within minutes of the plane being reported missing, asking when a page would launch. But DigitalGlobe is always keeping a watchful eye.  ""When the Nina ship went missing off the coast of Australia last year, we got involved after the crew had been missing for two months,"" Luke Barrington, Senior Manager of Geospatial Big Data at DigitalGlobe tells Wired.co.uk. ""Bad things happen in the world, then people would call DigitalGlobe some time later. This week, five minutes after the news of the Malaysia incident I was getting text messages and emails.""DigitalGlobe's constellation of five satellites, which scope the world at a rate of 75 laps a day between them, has been harnessed for humanitarian reasons in the past. It has been used to track the movements of the Lord's Resistance Army across swathes of land in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, in order to predict and scupper their next attacks. But more and more, its capabilities are being called upon in emergent situations. Last year it posted images covering thousands of square kilometres to help in the hunt for a light aircraft crash in Idaho.  ""We were able to prioritise the search in the field to tell them where not to go. Then they flew over with a GoPro camera hanging out, and looked over footage when they got back to find one little sign of wreckage."" In that instance, the team was hunting for a glimpse of a white plane, in snow-covered mountains. Today, the search is not much easier. To help, as with the Idaho crash, DigitalGlobe has already posted satellite images to a Tomnod crowdsourcing page where every pixel covers 50cm of land space -- or in this case, water. Nasa's Landsat, in contrast, captures around 30 metres per pixel. ""The jet might occupy one pixel in that image,"" says Barrington.The former Tomnod employee explains he had unofficial requests right after news emerged from the US government and even insurance companies, all asking when the crowdsourcing platform would go live. The latter, he says, want to know whether the incident was terror-related, or a crash. ""At least we're getting involved sooner,"" Barrington tells us. For DigitalGlobe though, the operation starts as soon as the news hits the wires. The First Look team is tasked with reading tweets and scouring the wires 24/7 for emergent situations just like this. ""If you know you want to monitor a particular uranium site in the Middle East you might request imagery all the time -- but there's no analysts on staff at the US government whose job it is to look for a Malaysian plane.""First Look members make on the fly decisions about where their satellites might be needed and start programming them into position. For something like an earthquake, that might mean downloading data from before the incident, so search and rescue has a comparison. With the Malaysia incident it meant making inferences from the news to position the constellation correctly.

WorldView-2 satelliteEach satellite already circles the Earth from the north to the south pole, taking 90 minutes to do one lap at heights of around 400 to 700km above Earth. ""They stay in a Sun-synchronised orbit,"" explains Barrington, ""staying in line with a point on surface of the Earth where its roughly 10.30am so we know we'll get sunlight and not too many shadows."" Each can be skewed up to 45 degrees to gain more scope and capture a few different time zones. When an analyst makes a decision about the ground/water they need to cover, the closest satellite moves into position. This week, two have been moved.Shortly after news of the missing airline got out, rumours flooded the networks that an oil slick had been spotted in the Gulf of Thailand that could be jet fuel, and Landsat data also pointed the team there. At 10.30am on Sunday, two shots were taken to the the north east of the Malaysian peninsula off the coast. Those images have been loaded to Tomnod, but it looks as though the fuel was from ships, so the satellites have been moved closer to the southern tip of Cambodia.Like the Idaho plane crash, we are looking for a needle in a haystack today. ""Getting through all those pixels is difficult, and we're looking for a feature that isn't specifically defined. I imagine at this stage -- and I hope we're wrong -- it's not going to look like regular plane. This is why we ask for the public's help.""Barrington says 100 people contacted him within minutes of the incident to ask when they could help. The Tomnod community is a loyal one, and is used to scouring through mundane images of landmass, snow or water to hunt for that one indistinguishable scrap of pixel that holds the answer. ""They can click on the map just like when using Google Maps, then go on to the next area and try and see as many pixels as possible. We have hundreds or thousands doing this all in real time. ""But it's incredibly difficult, differentiating between clouds, waves and wreckage to find those one or two points which will be valuable. You'd be surprised how many clouds look like ships. We use a set of algorithms to rank the crowd and see where people are agreeing -- if 99 out of 100 people are all clicking on this one funny little pixel right here, for instance. The algorithm sifts through that data to see who is reliable and who is not, so maybe shouldn't be trusted as much. Then those pixels get reviewed by our analysts and sent out to people searching.""The team is continually adding to the image set on Tomnod, ensuring each is covered five times or more. ""We keep on going until we're done, or we find something.""Once the crowd gets going though, as it already has, Barrington says it could take minutes or hours to go through 1,000sq km strips like the ones already loaded.For the missing Nina ship, more than 100 images of that scale were searched and dissected by the crowdsourcing community. For those onboard, however, it was unfortunately much too late. The search got underway as a last resort, when all other avenues had come up empty. But as the public, and governments, become more and more used to calling on the expertise of private companies with resources like DigitalGlobe, the gap begins to close between when an emergency strikes and when satellites are called to action.

A new crowdsourcing website called Tomnod set up to allow people to search satellite images for Malaysia Flight 370 has crashed.The website became unresponsive as the viral topic surged in social discussions within the hour of the initiative being reported.ABC highlights the crowdsourcing search for the flight and explains how Tomnod was set up by DigitalGlobe, based in Colorado to give people the tools to look through satellite imagery of the Pacific ocean.Due to the time zones, there are currently no updates being issued from the team behind the Tomnod satellite search, but we expect some more updates later in the day.Users on Tomnod can tag objects in satellite photosThe overwhelming demand from international visitors has made the website either not responsive or unable to load new connections. As of this moment, a “Could not open connection to database error” appears for users wishing to log in.As the mystery over the jet’s disappearance deepens, the crowdsourcing website could aid Asian nations currently exploring the ocean to pinpoint unusual objects floating in the water.The satellite imagery available on the Tomnod website is of very high resolution giving uses the ability to comb the sea surface at distance of just a few meters.Have you tried to log on in the past few hours?

874	"With the mystery over what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 still raising questions for the world’s air crash investigators, one company are hoping that the power of crowds might be able to help solve the most basic of problems: where did the plane crash?With thousands of miles of ocean to scour, narrowing down where the wreckage is makes for a challenge – but according to ABC News, DigitalGlobe have a potential solution. They’ve trained five satellite cameras on to the region and have split up the resulting high-resolution images into thousands of smaller ones. To sort through all of this data quickly, they want to enlist the general public to help.If you head over to the Tomnod website, you can start to sift through some of the images picked at random – marking any that look suspicious or as though they may contain debris. If thousands of people do this then the firm can then use an algorithm to figure out which images are provoking the most interest, and hand them over to the experts for them to check out.“We’ll say, ‘Here are our top ten suspicious or interesting locations,'” the ABC article quotes DigitalGlobe’s Luke Barrington as saying. “Is it really an aircraft wing that’s been chopped in half or is this some other debris floating on the ocean? We may not be 100 percent sure, but if this is where I had to go pick a location to go looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I’d start.”This isn’t the first time this sort of crowdsourcing has been used to tackle problems involving large volumes of data – the website Galaxy Zoo has long pioneered this technique for the somewhat happier task of identifying and classifying new galaxies from photos taken by space telescopes.In fact, DigitalGlobe have also tried this once before – when they partnered with Amazon to attempt to locate adventurer Steve Fossett, who went missing when flying over Nevada in 2007. Shortly after, many critics of the crowdsourcing dubbed it a waste of time.So will this latest effort help solve the Malaysia mystery? Obviously we hope so. Head over to Mar 11, 2014James O’Malley

875	"As the mystery of the missing Malaysian Airlines deepens, a Colorado satellite imaging company is offering satellite images that may be useful in searching for the missing plane.DigitalGlobe, which owns and operates private imaging satellites, has joined the crowd in an effort for scanning the areas of Gulf of Thailand through its satellites, where the plane is suspected to have crashed into the water.The flight with 239 passengers on board lost its communication with the ground, on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur which is untraceable for the third consecutive day.""DigitalGlobe activates FirstLook that is used during natural disasters and man-made crisis by emergency response agencies, while Tomnod is activated for different and selective purposes,"" explained Luke Barringto, senior manager of Geospatial Big Data for DigitalGlobe. The images taken from these satellites is positioned around 400 miles above the ground.In the missing Flight MH370 case, the images are made accessible to the public - which is a concept called crowdsourcing. The aim behind crowdsourcing is to survey the images with the help of many viewers in an attempt to find possible clues.""We try to use the crowd wisely and not tire them out. The story here is much more about the search than it is about the response. This whole feeling of not knowing, the lack of information or ability to do anything, we have seen time and again, is why people want to get involved,"" Denverpost quoted Barrington saying.Through the Tomnod website, people can review the images and help locate something of interest.Tomnod, within the first hour of its crowdsourcing on Monday, had 60,000 page views and over thousands tags.3,200 square kilometres of imagery has been made available for people to search online and over the next 24 hours, more images are likely to release.""For people who aren't able to drive a boat through the Pacific Ocean to get to the Malaysian peninsula, or who cannot fly aeroplanes to look there, this is a way that they can contribute and try to help out,"" ABC News quoted Barrington.Users can zoom in for the satellite images and send a message, if they find anything that could be a wreckage. An algorithm will be used to find the overlapped tags, where multiple people have found something noteworthy.Expert analysis will then identify the most prominent areas and share the useful information with the authorities for further investigation.""We'll say here are our top ten suspicious or interesting locations. Is it really an aircraft wing that's been chopped in half or is this some other debris floating on the ocean? We may not be 100 percent sure, but if this is where I had to go, pick a location to go looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I'd start."" he said.Currently, the images that are available to search are region where Gulf of Thailand meets the South China Sea."

878	As an international swarm of boats and aircraft canvass the Gulf of Thailand and west coast of the Malay Peninsula looking for any sign of Flight MH370, an American satellite imaging firm is calling on netizens to help assist in their crowd-sourced search for the missing plane.According to a press release published by DigitalGlobe on Monday, volunteers can aid the mission by signing up at the group’s Tomnod platform, where they can begin “combing through satellite imagery for clues that may help locate the missing aircraft.”A representative from the Colorado-based firm said cameras from five of its orbiting satellites had been set on the Gulf of Thailand where the lost plane is believed to have crashed, according to ABC.The company has already published an estimated 3,200 sq-kms of imagery online that volunteers can begin poring over immediately, and have promised to update their cache of images as more become available.“[On Monday], the Malaysian government updated the search area to reflect new information, and DigitalGlobe revised its tasking plan to collect imagery further north in the Gulf of Thailand,” read a statement published by the company online. Additional images are set to be released on Tuesday morning.DigitalGlobe launched a similar campaign in the wake of deadly Typhoon Haiyan, which swept across the Philippines last November, during which time thousands of volunteers flagged over 60,000 objects.Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished on Saturday morning with 239 people aboard. There was no distress call and no trace of the aircraft has been spotted. Investigators have not so far ruled out any possibilities for what may have cause its disappearance.	Business
879	"The Chrysler Group has announced it is issuing two separate recalls that will affect nearly 37,000 vehicles in the U.S.The first recall affects 18,700 Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs from the 2012 and 2013 model years. The vehicles are being recalled to correct an issue with the software in an optional emergency braking system.The system's factory settings restrict the flow of brake fluid too much, causing customers to complain about an odd feeling in the brake pedal, according to Chrysler. “Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations,” the company said in a statement. Another 6,555 SUVs outside the U.S. have also been recalled. Also on Chrysler Group’s recall list are 18,100 Fiat 500L cars in the U.S. from the 2014 model year.These cars use an automated dual-clutch transmission, and there have been reports that the gearboxes were slow to shift out of park or into the gear selected by the driver.Chrysler said a software update will correct the issue, which is tied to extreme temperatures affecting one piece of the transmission. In addition to the cars in the U.S., another 1,400 500L models will be recalled in Canada. Of all the affected models, approximately 200 may need an entirely new shifter.Chrysler Group will notify owners of all affected vehicles included in the two recalls, and any necessary repairs or updates will be done free of charge by dealers.No accidents or injuries have been reported as a result of either of these issues, Chrysler Group saidALSO:N.Y.

881	"Chrysler has issued two voluntary recalls -- one for the 2012-2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, the other for the 2014 Fiat 500L. The recalls stem from two unrelated problems, and Chrysler knows of no accidents or injuries associated with either flaw. 2012-2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE & DODGE DURANGO According to a press release from Chrysler, the Grand Cherokee/Durango recall is meant to address ""pedal feel"" on the vehicles' brakes. The automaker was contacted by a parts supplier, which believed that one of its components might be interfering with Chrysler's Ready Alert Braking system. That system ""primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop"".Upon investigation, Chrysler found that brake fluid in the Grand Cherokee and Durango was, in fact, being restricted, which caused diminished brake pedal feel. However, the company points out that ""Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation"" as a result of the problem.The flaw affects some 25,250 vehicles -- 18,700 purchased in the U.S., 825 in Canada, 530 in Mexico, and the remaining 5,200 located in other countries.Chrysler hasn't issued a timeline for fixing the problem, but says that it will let owners know when they can take their vehicles to Chrysler dealers for free repairs. If you own one of the affected vehicles and have additional questions, you're encouraged to contact Chrysler directly at 800-853-1403. 2014 FIAT 500L The Fiat 500L, on the other hand, is being recalled for a glitch in its transmission software. According to a press release:Chrysler Group engineers launched an investigation after reviewing reports that some vehicles equipped with dual dry clutch automatic transmissions would not shift readily out of park and/or their transmissions did not receive, or were slow to receive, an intended gear selection.The problem has been linked to a microcontroller associated with the transmission -- a component that Chrysler says might be ""compromised"" by extremes in temperature. That sounds like a mechanical problem, but the fix comes in the form of a software update (though Chrysler says that 200 of the recalled vehicles may require replacement of the shift-module to ensure compatibility with the new software).All told, the Fiat recall affects around 19,500 vehicles, at least 20 percent of which are still on dealer lots. Approximately 18,100 of the recalled vehicles are located in the U.S., with the remaining 1,400 in Canada.As with the Grand Cherokee and Durango recall, Chrysler hasn't indicated when it will begin notifying owners of the Fiat 500L recall. However, when it does, owners will be able to take their vehicles to Fiat dealers, who will fix them free of charge. For additional information, contact Chrysler at 800-853-1403.___________________________________________Follow The Car Connection on Facebook, Twitter and Google+.(c) 2014, High Gear Media. highgear_article "	Business

Chrysler Group LLC plans to hire up to 1,000 part-time employees for the Toledo Assembly complex to keep production rolling while giving regular employees the chance for a break.“Our people have been working a tremendous amount of hours,” Plant Manager Chuck Padden said. “To get them more time off is important to us, to make sure they’re refreshed, and can work safely.”With record demand for the Jeep Wrangler and the launch of the new Jeep Cherokee last year, employees are regularly working 60 hours a week. And while employees generally like the extra pay that results from working overtime, such lengthy stretches can wear on workers, he said.A company spokesman said Monday that Chrysler has hired 380 temporary part-time employees this year, though 50 have been converted to regular, full-time employees.Chrysler has collected applications for the jobs and is not currently accepting any more. Officials are in the process of conducting assessment testing and expect more employees to be brought on in the coming weeks.Most of the new hires will get between 10 and 30 hours per week.“It can vary, depending upon on the teams they’re on. Typically it’s a Friday-Saturday-Monday situation,” Mr. Padden said. “So if we’re scheduled for six days, TPT [temporary part-time] could be here three of them. Some of them might only work one day a week.”The TPT employees are paid $15.78 an hour, the same rate as new full-time hires. They’re also offered limited benefits, including health insurance.How long the new temporary part-time jobs last depends mostly on demand for the two vehicles built there.While it isn’t unusual for automakers to use part-time help to ease the burden at busy plants, it’s not typically done to this level. Officials from the company and the union both said it’s an innovative solution that will boost production, allow weary workers more time off, and bring new employees into the plant.Bruce Baumhower, president of United Auto Workers Local 12, said the help should take some of the load off employees who have worked long hours for a long time.“They’ve worked through the Christmas shutdown the last couple years; they’ve worked through summer shutdowns. Summertime’s coming; they’ve got kids in Little League and other things,” he said. “They’ve done an unbelievable job of carrying the load.”Mark Epley, UAW Local 12’s Jeep Unit Chairman and one of the key people in brokering the deal, said it’s important to get employees a little time off.“You’ve gotta remember, these people are working 10 hours a day, six days a week,” he said.The contract currently gives employees the right to take off a Saturday after working consecutive Saturdays. With the addition of part-time workers, employees will be able to take off other days as well.“It’s very important to have the day off you want with your family,” he said.The added help will allow the plant to run the Wrangler line every Saturday, which they haven’t been able to do. That’s important to Chrysler, which is trying to squeeze even more Wrangler production out of the plant this year after a record year in 2013.That task falls on Mr. Padden, who took over as plant manager on Jan. 1.Mr. Padden, 54, has been with Chrysler since 1995 and is on his third tour in Toledo. He most recently served as the launch manager for the Cherokee, then took over the top position in the plant following former plant manager Zach Leroux’s promotion to head of assembly operations for Chrysler.“We’ve got a lot of good things going for us right now,” Mr. Padden said. “As the volume is picking up we’ll be one of the largest manufacturing sites in North America. We won’t talk specifics on the numbers, but we’ll be one of the largest manufacturing sites in North America with the two [lines] going at full tilt.”Chuck Padden, plant manager for the Toledo Assembly complex, stands in front of the line of completed Jeep Cherokees. The plant is currently assembling 990 Cherokees per day.

Mr. Padden said Chrysler’s goal for the plant is to build 2,000 vehicles a day. Currently, employees at the Toledo Assembly complex build about 840 Wranglers and 990 Cherokees a day. Mr. Padden said the Cherokee line should reach full capacity in the year’s third quarter.Right now the focus for Cherokee is on fine-tuning the build process and ramping up work on building international models. Jeep officials have said they plan to eventually sell the Cherokee in 150 countries.“Every country has its own unique specifications they want to see. Everything from the way VIN stamps are put into a car to the way to the dashboard reads and the way the radio reads,” Mr. Padden said.Chrysler expects about 15 percent of Cherokees built in Toledo to be destined for international markets.Mr. Padden praised the work force in Toledo and its good working relationship with the company. He also understands Jeep’s importance to the city.“It’s not just another company out there. We’re so integrated into the community of Toledo,” he said. “We recognize the interdependence of Jeep to Toledo. Continuing to work together, we hope to be here for a long, long time.”Contact Tyrel Linkhorn at tlinkhorn@theblade.com or 419-724-6134 or on Twitter @BladeAutoWriter.

891	AUBURN HILLS (WKZO) -- Chrysler is recalling over 25-thousand Jeep and Dodge SUV’s because of a braking issue, even though there haven’t been any reports of accidents or injuries.They plan to adjust and update software to improve the “feel” of the brake pedal during hard braking maneuvers.Industry expert Katie Kerwin isn’t sure she has ever heard of a recall just to fix the “feel” of a vehicle but it makes sense in this case, because the feel of the brake could be critical in an emergency.It has to do with the flow of the brake fluid through the system when the brake pedal is suddenly depressed.Customers will be notified when it’s their turn for servicing. Chrysler will cover the cost. 	Business

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ first jointly designed vehicle, the Dodge Dart, isn’t doing as well as the group wanted to, with sales down 33 percent in the first two months of this year. Consequently, the Belvidere, Illinois plant where the compact sedan is built has sent 325 workers home for a week.  Built on the same architecture as the Alfa Romeo Giulietta, the Dodge Dart fell to ninth place among compact cars in the U.S. market this year, from eighth place last year, overtaken by the Kia Forte. The segment’s leader, the Toyota Corolla, saw 50,000 sales through February, compared to Dart’s 10,000. Chrysler confirmed the temporary layoffs at Belvidere in a statement to Reuters, but did not give production cut figures. The company only said that the layoffs were meant “to balance vehicle supply with current sales demand.” The plant has approximately 4,500 employees. Some automotive analysts believe Dart sales are slow because the lacks customer awareness for making small cars, while others believe the Dodge model is under-powered. The 2014 Dodge Dart is available with three engines: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 160hp, a 1.4-liter MultiAir turbocharged four-cylinder with 160hp and a 2.4-liter MultiAir 2 TigerShark four-cylinder developing 184hp. Adding to the sales problem, there are twice as many 2013 models on dealer lots as 2014 models because of a relatively late model year change. As a result, Dodge in February increased the average incentives discount by $400 from a year earlier, to $2,200 per vehicle. By Dan Mihalascu  Story References:  Reuters Ed. Note: In the Reuters report, Dennis Virag, president of the Automotive Consulting Group in Michigan, mentioned that the Dart is underpowered, which doesn’t exactly hold true, as it only applies to sports versions like the 201hp Civic Si or the 210hp VW Jetta GLI.

894	Another round of recalls—this time, thoughtfully reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration before a decade went by—comes today from Chrysler, regarding anti-lock brakes on the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango. The affected vehicles involved in this callback are more than 25,000 sport-utilities produced in the 2012 and 2013 model years, of which nearly 19,000 are located in the United States.According to a statement from the conglomerato in Auburn Hills, “certain aggressive braking maneuvers” were made more vulnerable by restriction in the flow of brake fluid to the anti-lock brake system. While Chrysler states that neither brake function was lost nor was it out of compliance with regulation, the pedal feel under such circumstances “was not consistent with customer expectations.”The manufacturer assures that neither death nor injury has yet resulted in these vehicles, which were fitted with the brands’ Ready Alert Braking. Ready Alert Braking is an active-braking system that functions by priming the brakes for optimal response during sudden stops.Service dates for the affected sport-utes, which comprise a single-digit percentage of total SUVs sold by both brands in those model years, will be announced soon. This announcement differs from Jeep’s erstwhile campaign to recall and repair 1.56 million 1993–1998 Grand Cherokees and 2002–2007 Liberty sport-utes.	Business

897	A 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee, one of the recalled modelsLast week, Chrysler Group issued a recall alert after a supplier brought a concern to the company concerning anti-lock braking. The Chrysler Group anti-lock brake recall affects 25,250 SUVs manufactured for 2012 and 2013 model years.According to the official recall alert, Chrysler Group hopes to improve pedal feel during certain braking situations. While brake function is not lost and still complies with regulation, Chrysler Group believes that pedal feel is not consistent with customer expectation and seeks to resolve this. No injuries or accidents have been reported as a result of this issue.Following an investigation, Chrysler Group learned that flow of brake-fluid was being limited to a high degree. A quick software update will optimize flow and bring the appropriate pedal feel to the SUVs.Affected vehicles include Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos from 2012 and 2013. In total, these amount to 18,700 vehicles here in the States, as well as 530 in Mexico and 825 in Canada, plus an additional 5,200 in other markets.A 2013 Dodge Durango, one of the recalled modelsDrivers of affected vehicles will be notified by Chrysler Group and instructed where to receive the update, at no cost to the customer.

900	"Modern ReadersBreaking World, Tech, Sports, Business  NewsThousands of units of the 2012 to 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango and the 2014 Fiat 500L will reportedly be recalled, according to a new announcement from Chrysler.  The recalls are due to separate issues on the Grand Cherokee/Durango and the 500L; for the Grand Cherokee and Durango, both SUVs are suspected of having problems with brake feel, while the 500L is in need of having its gearbox software tweaked.  No accidents nor injuries have been reported due to the issues.About 25,250 2012 to 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango units, specifically those with the Ready Alert Braking System, are reportedly suffering from questionable brake feel, as based on customer feedback.Despite these complaints, the brakes are still working like they should, but in the light of customer expectations not being met, a supplier found that a component in the system was at fault for poor flow of brake fluid.  This, according to Chrysler, will be fixed by a software update.19,500 2014 Fiat 500L units, including about 20 percent which are still in dealerships, are apparently suffering from problems wherein the dual-clutch automatic transmissions cannot properly shift out of park.  This may have something to do with the transmission being generally slow or unresponsive.  Like the above issue, dealerships will sort out the Fiat 500L problem with a software update.

902	6 Min ReadTRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya’s parliament voted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan out of office on Tuesday after rebels humiliated the government by loading crude on a tanker that fled from naval forces, officials said, in a sign of the worsening chaos in the OPEC member state. Libyan gunboats later chased the tanker along Libya’s eastern Mediterranean coast and opened fire, damaging it, a military spokesman said. Italian naval ships were helping move the tanker to a Libyan government-controlled port, he said. But Italy denied any of its vessels were in the area at the time and the reported firing incident could not be confirmed. Western powers fear the vast North African state could even break apart with the government struggling to rein in armed militias and tribesmen who helped oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but want to grab power and oil revenues. Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, will be temporarily replaced by Defence Minister Abdallah al-Thinni, who was sworn in by parliament on Tuesday evening. Zeidan, who came to power in 2012 after Libya’s first free parliamentary vote following four decades of quirky one-man rule by Gaddafi, had been facing opposition from Islamists and the public blaming him for Libya’s anarchic transition since 2011. Deputies said they had decided to mount a no-confidence vote after the tanker managed to sail away from Es Sider port, one of three major export terminals the government has lost to rebels. “The government has been weakened for a time and we need a new personality,” said al-Sharif al-Wafi, an independent lawmaker. A new prime minister will be elected by deputies within two weeks, he said. State prosecutor Abdel-Qader Radwan said later he had banned Zeidan from travelling abroad because he faced an investigation over alleged financial irregularities. Zeidan told Reuters late on Monday in an interview that navy forces had halted the tanker and were escorting it to a government-controlled port in western Libya. But rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran mocked Zeidan by going on television hours later while standing on a ship, insisting his forces still controlled the 37,000-tonne tanker. When Libyans woke up the next morning officials had to admit the North Korea-flagged tanker had escaped at dawn, making it the first sale of crude bypassing the Tripoli government. Walid al-Tarhouni, spokesman for the national oil protection forces, said navy boats chased the tanker hours later east of Benghazi, further east, and opened fire. “The ship was damaged and it is not moving,” he said. Italian ships were helping to shift the tanker to a government-run port, he said. But the Italian defense ministry denied any of its vessels had been in the area at the time. It was not possible to verify the firing incident at sea. Government and rebels have given conflicting accounts of the tanker saga. It was unclear where the tanker had planned to sail. Government officials say the ship was flagged in North Korea, a flag of convenience to keep the ownership secret. Zeidan’s exit gave joy to his many opponents but it complicates Libya’s transition as there is no obvious successor who can unite the feuding parties in a country with no tradition of political institutions. Analysts said Zeidan was not to blame for many problems such as lack of development since the ousting of Gaddafi as the government was simply running out of money due to a wave of protests at oilfields and ports. Oil is Libya’s lifeline. Zeidan had accused the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists of blocking budget payments for infrastructure projects and improved army and police forces to make him fail. Parliament will support acting prime minister Thinni and not obstruct his work, its head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain told the assembly after the defense minister gave his oath. But while he spoke, clashes erupted in the central city of Sirte west of Es Sider port where rebels were fighting pro-government forces assembled to end the blockages of oil ports. Rebel gunmen had blocked the gate to an air base in Sirte, the only main air force base in the region. Residents said fighters on both sides had been wounded though no details were immediately available. In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said. Western diplomats worry the conflict over oil might dismember Libya as rebels demand autonomy for the east, which was neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte. The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack. They want to restore political autonomy with the historic eastern Cyrenaica region which shared power and wealth with Tripolitania in the west under King Idris, who preceded Gaddafi. Libya has been trying to rebuild its armed forces since Gaddafi’s overthrow, but analysts say they are not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising against the veteran strongman.

March 12 2014

Libya's parliament has ousted the prime minister in a vote of confidence, after his government was embarrassed when a militia controlling an eastern port defied Tripoli's authority by trying to sell oil.
The chamber named the defence minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, as an interim prime minister until a replacement for the embattled Ali Zidan is found.The ""no"" vote won the support of 121 MPs out of the approximately 180 that remain in the parliament, according to one MP.Mr Zidan, whose ousting had been seen as a matter of time to many Libyans, had no immediate public reaction to the vote.He was elected in 2012 as the first prime minister after the 2011 overthrow and killing of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.He has had the backing of the liberal-leaning National Forces Alliance against a bloc led by the Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, although parliament is divided as much on regional lines as ideological ones.Col Gaddafi's 40-year rule left Libya with few strong state institutions, and Mr Zidan has presided over a government that has little authority and is frequently subjected to humiliations. In the absence of a strong military and police force, it relies on militias to keep order - but many defy the government, with one of them briefly abducting Mr Zidan himself last year.The Islamist-led bloc has long wanted to oust him, although until now it could not drum up the votes. It was not clear if parliament changed sides but Mr Zidan in recent days has appeared particularly helpless. He confessed to reporters on Saturday that the nation's military does not carry out his orders and complained that ""everyone is working against the government.""The latest crisis is linked to an autonomy movement in Libya's east, home to most of its oil. Several months ago, a militia seized the key port of al-Sidra and in recent days, the group attempted to load oil into a North Korean-flagged tanker that docked there without government permission.The government said on Monday that its forces had taken control of the tanker, but the militia denied this. Underlying Libya's crisis is a dispute over the interim parliament, which reached the end of its mandate in February. Islamists want to extend its term while the other bloc wants new elections.

		A total of 124 lawmakers out of 194 in attendance at the General National Congress (GNC) passed a vote of no-confidence – four more than the majority required – to oust Zeidan, MPs said on Tuesday.
	The GNC named Defense Minister Abdullah al-Thani as the interim prime minister, having two weeks to find a replacement for Zeidan.
	The move follows a standoff between the government and a group of militants in the eastern port of Sidra.
	Militants at the rebel-held port loaded oil into a North Korea-flagged tanker, the Morning Glory, which had docked there without government permission on Saturday.
	Authorities however later said they had taken control of the tanker and were prepared to unload the crude once it reached a western port, and then launch legal measures against the potential buyers.
	However, the seaworthy tanker slipped past the warships during inclement weather early on Tuesday.
	Tripoli has made efforts to end a wave of protests at oil ports and fields across the country that have drastically reduced its oil output.
	Zeidan had earlier promised that he would end the blockade of all rebel-held ports in the east either through talks or by military force.

A North Korean-flagged tanker that loaded crude oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya has escaped navy warships deployed to intercept it and is now in international waters, rebels and a state oil company official said.The Morning Glory , which docked in al-Sidra port on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held port since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.""The tanker left and is now in international waters,"" Reuters quoted Mohammad Hitab, spokesman for the state-run al-Waha Oil Company operating the al-Sidra port, as saying.  Rebels demanding a bigger share of oil revenue and political autonomy in the east seized three ports last summer and partly control a fourth.       The central government had threatened armed action , even an air strike, to prevent the tanker from getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.Members of the General National Congress (GNC), Libya's highest political authority, said that bad weather prevented the navy's small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean.Abdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that the navy's warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.""The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,"" he said.The tanker's escape is a new humiliation for the Tripoli authorities who have been battling to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year rule of Muammar Gaddafi.In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel fighters have carved out their own fiefdoms.Subscribe via RSSRead MoreRead MoreRead MoreRead MoreRead MoreRead MorePuigdemont's Together for Catalonia party to file complaint against the move, saying he is a legitimate candidate.

910	CAIRO -- Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan was ousted Tuesday in a parliamentary vote of no confidence on the heels of a confrontation with a breakaway militia that sought to bypass the weak government and sell oil on its own.Lawmakers named the defense minister to act as prime minister until a replacement for Zeidan is found.Zeidan had been struggling for months to keep control of a fractured and impotent central administration in the North African state, which faces growing chaos in the wake of Moammar Kadafi’s overthrow three years ago.Rebel commanders have struck out on their own, with armed groups -- sometimes loosely affiliated with the government and drawing pay for that nominal alliance -- wielding far more power than the state.Militias had seized control of crucial eastern oil ports months ago, and over the weekend moved for the first time to deal directly with would-be buyers. This week, a North Korean-flagged tanker took on a cargo of crude oil and sailed from the port of Es Sedr, with the militias defying government threats of attack.Zeidan's government had ordered the military to block the tanker's departure, and subsequently claimed to have taken control of the vessel. Militias denied that had occurred.laura.king@latimes.comTwitter: @laurakingLATHassan is a special correspondent.	Business
911	 TRIPOLI, Libya — Libya’s parliament handed a no-confidence vote to Prime Minister Ali Zeidan on Tuesday in yet another jolt to the oil-rich nation’s crumbling political stability. Libya’s elected General National Congress (GNC) ousted Zeidan a day after the government failed to stop a North Korean-flagged oil tanker from departing Libya’s eastern shore with an unauthorized $36 million cargo of crude oil.Less than three years after the fall of dictator Moammar Gaddafi, Libya has been riven by increasingly violent political animosities as powerful militias, aligned with rival political factions, have struggled to exert control over key government offices, territory and — significantly — the country’s vast oil resources.Federalist fighters seeking autonomy for eastern Libya have laid siege to some of the country’s key oil wells and ports, effectively paralyzing exports for the past six months.The weekend docking of the North Korean tanker marked the first independent sale of oil by a non-state body, threatening to escalate regional and tribal tensions into a full-fledged war.By Tuesday night, fighting had erupted in the central city of Sirte as militias, moving east from the city of Misurata in an effort to seize the eastern ports, came to blows with an eastern militia.Zeidan had earlier threatened to use force if the tanker tried to leave. But after a three-day stand-off between the eastern rebels and government-allied forces, the rebels said Tuesday that the tanker had entered international waters.“We don’t care what the GNC does with Zeidan. They can do what they like,” said Senussi El-Megrabi, a spokesman for rebel commander Ibrahim al-Jathran. “We have nothing to do with them.”The tanker, the Morning Glory, left Libya’s Sidra port at 8 a.m., Megrabi said. Libya’s deeply divided parliament on Tuesday designated the country’s defense minister to take over for Zeidan for the next 15 days until the body selects a new prime minister, state media reported. That person would become the country’s fifth prime minister in just over two years. Zeidan’s popularity quickly plummeted during his year and a half in office, amid widespread frustration at his failure to empower the country’s weak government institutions and disarm the militias that control the streets. Zeidan’s opponents have accused him of having his own ties to one powerful militia and of making payoffs to others for their compliance. The country appeared on the verge of spiraling into further chaos Tuesday night as rumors circulated in Tripoli that the tanker had come under attack and caught fire, and as the fighting raged on in Sirte.Megrabi said that rebel forces had already repelled an earlier attack by Misurata fighters but were undeterred. The rebels have said that any attacks by government-allied forces would constitute an act of war. “We are expecting another tanker to Heriga port,” he added. “But I don’t know when exactly that will be.”	Business
912	Libya's parliament has ousted prime minister Ali Zidan after a vote of no confidence.He was kicked out because he failed to deal decisively with rebels who had threatened to start selling oil independently unless they were given a greater share of oil revenues along with autonomy from Tripoli.The no-confidence motion was approved by 124 of the 194 members of the General National Congress.MPs named the defence minister as interim prime minister.Most politicians in Libya are backed by militias with regional or ideological allegiances, and many are not likely to accept his removal, according to AP.When North Korean-flagged tanker Morning Glory tried to approach Libyan rebel-held Es Sider port, Zidan threatened to bomb it if it was loaded with oil by rebels.The tanker - which eventually docked at Al-Sidra  - was reported to have loaded at least 234,000 barrels of crude. It was the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since they challenged the dominance of the central government last July.The rebels, led by former militia leader Ibrahim Jathran, were also demanding national identity cards and a local council. Government ministers have promised to accede to their requests.Libya's defence minister held talks with protesters blocking the 340,000bpd El Sharara oilfield in the south. The state-owned NOC (National Oil Corp) has not confirmed when it will reopen.The three seized oil ports accounted for 600,000bpd in exports before the protests started in 2013.Libya's oil output has fallen to just over 200,000bpd from 1.4 million bpd.

917	Reuters Staff6 Min Read* Parliament appoints defence minister as acting PM * Clashes between rebels, pro-government militias reported * Western powers fear chaos in oil-producing Libya   (Adds Zeidan banned from travelling abroad, paragraph 8) By Ulf Laessing and Feras Bosalum TRIPOLI, March 11 (Reuters) - Libya’s parliament voted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan out of office on Tuesday after rebels humiliated the government by loading crude on a tanker that fled from naval forces, officials said, in a sign of the worsening chaos in the OPEC member state. Libyan gunboats later chased the tanker along Libya’s eastern Mediterranean coast and opened fire, damaging it, a  military spokesman said. Italian naval ships were helping move the tanker to a Libyan government-controlled port, he said. But Italy denied any of its vessels were in the area at the time and the reported firing incident could not be confirmed. Western powers fear the vast North African state could even break apart with the government struggling to rein in armed militias and tribesmen who helped oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but want to grab power and oil revenues. Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, will be temporarily replaced by Defence Minister Abdallah al-Thinni, who was sworn in by parliament on Tuesday evening. Zeidan, who came to power in 2012 after Libya’s first free parliamentary vote following four decades of quirky one-man rule by Gaddafi, had been facing opposition from Islamists and the public blaming him for Libya’s anarchic transition since 2011. Deputies said they had decided to mount a no-confidence vote after the tanker managed to sail away from Es Sider port, one of three major export terminals the government has lost to rebels. “The government has been weakened for a time and we need a new personality,” said al-Sharif al-Wafi, an independent lawmaker. A new prime minister will be elected by deputies within two weeks, he said. State prosecutor Abdel-Qader Radwan said later he had banned Zeidan from travelling abroad because he faced an investigation over alleged financial irregularities. Zeidan told Reuters late on Monday in an interview that navy forces had halted the tanker and were escorting it to a government-controlled port in western Libya. But rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran mocked Zeidan by going on television hours later while standing on a ship, insisting his forces still controlled the 37,000-tonne tanker. When Libyans woke up the next morning officials had to admit the North Korea-flagged tanker had escaped at dawn, making it the first sale of crude bypassing the Tripoli government. Walid al-Tarhouni, spokesman for the national oil protection forces, said navy boats chased the tanker hours later east of Benghazi, further east, and opened fire. “The ship was damaged and it is not moving,” he said. Italian ships were helping to shift the tanker to a government-run port, he said. But the Italian defence ministry denied any of its vessels had been in the area at the time. It was not possible to verify the firing incident at sea. Government and rebels have given conflicting accounts of the tanker saga. It was unclear where the tanker had planned to sail. Government officials say the ship was flagged in North Korea, a flag of convenience to keep the ownership secret. Zeidan’s exit gave joy to his many opponents but it complicates Libya’s transition as there is no obvious successor who can unite the feuding parties in a country with no tradition of political institutions. Analysts said Zeidan was not to blame for many problems such as lack of development since the ousting of Gaddafi as the government was simply running out of money due to a wave of protests at oilfields and ports. Oil is Libya’s lifeline. Zeidan had accused the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists of blocking budget payments for infrastructure projects and improved army and police forces to make him fail. Parliament will support acting prime minister Thinni and not obstruct his work, its head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain told the assembly after the defence minister gave his oath. But while he spoke, clashes erupted in the central city of Sirte west of Es Sider port where rebels were fighting pro-government forces assembled to end the blockages of oil ports. Rebel gunmen had blocked the gate to an air base in Sirte, the only main air force base in the region. Residents said fighters on both sides had been wounded though no details were immediately available. In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said. Western diplomats worry the conflict over oil might dismember Libya as rebels demand autonomy for the east, which was neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte. The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack. They want to restore political autonomy with the historic eastern Cyrenaica region which shared power and wealth with Tripolitania in the west under King Idris, who preceded Gaddafi. Libya has been trying to rebuild its armed forces since Gaddafi’s overthrow, but analysts say they are not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising against the veteran strongman.

918	"Parliamentarians in Libya have passed a vote of no confidence in the country's Prime Minister Ali Zidan. It comes after a ship full of Libyan oil exported by a militia escaped into international waters. Libya's Defense Minister Abdullah al-Thani will step in as the country's premier for two weeks, until a permanent replacement is approved by the General National Congress.  ""The Congress voted to withdraw its confidence in the prime minister by 124 votes,"" lawmaker Suleiman al-Zubi told news agency AFP. Libya's top prosecutor also imposed a travel ban on Zeidan for his suspected involvement in the embezzlement of public funds, according to a post on his office's Facebook page. The vote was scheduled by parliamentarians who reacted angrily when a North Korean-flagged tanker laden with an estimated 234,000 barrels of crude oil dodged a naval blockade and escaped to sea. The tanker docked without government permission at the eastern port of al-Sidra, which is controlled by a rebel militia. The region's self-declared autonomous rebel government sold the oil. Zeidan's government threatened armed action to stop the tanker getting away, with Culture Minister Amin al-Habib saying on Sunday it would be ""turned into a pile of metal"" if it tried to leave port. The government earlier reported it had siezed the vessel. But bad weather proved to the tanker's advantage - on Tuesday it moved to the open Mediterranean while Libya's smaller navy craft were forced to stay close to shore. The escape is a major humiliation for Libya's fledgling government, with lawmakers voicing their anger at the failure. ""The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those members of parliament who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative,"" lawmaker Suad Gannur told the AFP news agency. Struggle for control Authorities in Tripoli have struggled to control much of the country since a revolt in 2011 which led to the downfall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. A multitude of former rebel militias have carved out their own areas of control, particularly in the oil-rich country's east. Last October the now-former prime minister Ali Zidan himself was briefly abducted by a militia group in Tripoli. se/rc ( AFP, AP, Reuters)Libyan government forces have taken control of a tanker that rebels had filled with crude oil which they'd hoped to sell. The North Korean-flagged vessel was seized, but blockades remain in place at ports and oilfields. (10.03.2014)

11 March, 15:13(ANSAmed) - TRIPOLI - A tanker flying a North Korean flag, docked illegally at the Libyan port of Sidra with a load of crude oil for export on behalf of a separatist group, eluded the Tripoli escort keeping it under check and took off, said a member of Libya's General National Congress (GNC).
The same parliamentary source said the North Korean oil tanker Morning Glory is now in international waters. The tanker distanced itself after illegally loading crude on behalf of a separatist group from eastern Libya.
The event, however, continues to remain shrouded in confusion. Libyan authorities last night declared that they took control of the ship after a brief armed clash with rebels who control the port, while the 33-year-old leader of the separatist group, Ibrahiml Jadran, immediately denied the government's declarations. Jadran, who appeared last night on television aboard a ship - said to be the Morning Glory - showed himself determined to export the oil independently of Tripoli and on behalf of Cirenaica, while respecting international obligations.
He also responded to recent declarations by the American ambassador to Tripoli, Deborah Jones, according to whom only Libya's national oil company has the right to sell the country's oil.        ""These declarations are illegal. We exercise our rights and we will continue to sell crude,"" the young leader thundered.

But the rebels rejected the assertion.By Rana JawadBBC News, TripoliIn the long-term, the debate is not really over whether Mr Zeidan's departure will help or make matters worse. That is because many people want to know if Libya's political players can set their differences aside long enough to allow any prime minister or government to rule the country effectively.There are deepening social, ideological, and regional fault-lines. The real power lies with the guns, and the guns are with competing militia brigades, some of whom have aligned themselves to opposing political parties and even to the ousted prime minister. If Libya's most pressing needs - disarmament, an effective army, and a consensus between political parties - are not dealt with, it ultimately will not make a difference who is in power. In recent months, there has been more public pressure on the General National Congress, who many want dissolved, than on the prime minister and his cabinet.Separatist militants have occupied three major eastern ports since August.They are seeking a greater share of the country's oil revenues, as well as autonomy for the historic eastern region of Cyrenaica.The tanker - named Morning Glory - was reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude at Sidra's oil terminal.It was the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held port since the separatist revolt against the central government in Tripoli erupted in July.The government is still struggling to assert its authority over the armed groups and tribesmen who helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says Mr Zeidan's removal is likely to raise more concerns over the stability of Libya as it struggles to maintain control over large parts of the country.Members of Libya's parliament, the General National Congress, said that bad weather had stopped the navy's ships from following the tanker into the Mediterranean from Sidra.Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told al-Nabaa TV that the navy vessels had been forced to sail close to the coast.""The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,"" he said.Analysts say it is unlikely the ship is owned or controlled by North Korea and it is probably sailing under a flag of convenience to keep its true ownership secret.On Monday, the GNC ordered a special force to be deployed to ""liberate"" all rebel-held oil terminals. The operation is due to start within one week.Libya's government has tried to curb protests at oil fields and ports, which have seen vital oil revenues plummet.However, there has been little progress at the indirect talks between officials and Ibrahim Jathran, a former anti-Gaddafi militia leader and regional head of the Petroleum Facilities Guard who is now leading the protests.His demands include the formation of an independent commission representing the three historic regions of Libya, which will supervise the sale of oil and ensure the country's east gets a greater share of revenues.Libya's oil output has slowed to a trickle since the protests started in July last year, depriving the Opec producer of its main budget source.The boys were on their way to a birthday party when they were hit by a car in west London.

927	A tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya broke through a naval blockade and escaped to sea on Tuesday, prompting angry MPs to move to oust the prime minister.The North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.Prime Minister Ali Zeidan’s government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels’ self-declared autonomous regional government.But members of Libya’s parliament, the General National Congress, said that bad weather prevented the navy’s small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean from the port of Al-Sidra.“The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow,” one GNC member told AFP.North Korean ship Morning Glory: escapes  with stolen Libyan crude oilAbdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC’s energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that the navy’s warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.“The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,” he said.The Morning Glory’s escape is a new humilation for the Tripoli authorities, who have struggled to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year dictatorship of Moamer Kadhafi.In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel militias, Islamist as well as regionalist, have carved out their own fiefdoms.The prime minister was himself briefly abducted by former rebel militia in the heart of the capital last October.Copyright © 2017.

933	"World Bulletin/News Desk Libya's parliament voted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan out of office on Tuesday after rebels humiliated the government by loading crude on a tanker that fled from naval forces, officials said, in a sign of the worsening chaos in the OPEC member state.Libyan gunboats later chased the tanker along Libya's eastern Mediterranean coast and opened fire, damaging it, a military spokesman said. Italian naval ships were helping move the tanker to a Libyan government-controlled port, he said. But Italy denied any of its vessels were in the area at the time and the reported firing incident could not be confirmed.Western powers fear the vast North African state could even break apart with the government struggling to rein in armed militias and tribesmen who helped oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but want to grab power and oil revenues.Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, will be temporarily replaced by Defence Minister Abdallah al-Thinni, who was sworn in by parliament on Tuesday evening.Zeidan, who came to power in 2012 after Libya's first free parliamentary vote following four decades of quirky one-man rule by Gaddafi, had been facing opposition from Islamists and the public blaming him for Libya's anarchic transition since 2011.Deputies said they had decided to mount a no-confidence vote after the tanker managed to sail away from Es Sider port, one of three major export terminals the government has lost to rebels.""The government has been weakened for a time and we need a new personality,"" said al-Sharif al-Wafi, an independent lawmaker. A new prime minister will be elected by deputies within two weeks, he said.State prosecutor Abdel-Qader Radwan said later he had banned Zeidan from travelling abroad because he faced an investigation over alleged financial irregularities.Zeidan told Reuters late on Monday in an interview that navy forces had halted the tanker and were escorting it to a government-controlled port in western Libya.But rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran mocked Zeidan by going on television hours later while standing on a ship, insisting his forces still controlled the 37,000-tonne tanker.When Libyans woke up the next morning officials had to admit the North Korea-flagged tanker had escaped at dawn, making it the first sale of crude bypassing the Tripoli government.Walid al-Tarhouni, spokesman for the national oil protection forces, said navy boats chased the tanker hours later east of Benghazi, further east, and opened fire.""The ship was damaged and it is not moving,"" he said. Italian ships were helping to shift the tanker to a government-run port, he said. But the Italian defence ministry denied any of its vessels had been in the area at the time.It was not possible to verify the firing incident at sea. Government and rebels have given conflicting accounts of the tanker saga.It was unclear where the tanker had planned to sail. Government officials say the ship was flagged in North Korea, a flag of convenience to keep the ownership secret.TRANSITION GETS MORE COMPLICATEDZeidan's exit gave joy to his many opponents but it complicates Libya's transition as there is no obvious successor who can unite the feuding parties in a country with no tradition of political institutions.Analysts said Zeidan was not to blame for many problems such as lack of development since the ousting of Gaddafi as the government was simply running out of money due to a wave of protests at oilfields and ports. Oil is Libya's lifeline.Zeidan had accused the Muslim Brotherhood and others of blocking budget payments for infrastructure projects and improved army and police forces to make him fail.Parliament will support acting prime minister Thinni and not obstruct his work, its head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain told the assembly after the defence minister gave his oath.But while he spoke, clashes erupted in the central city of Sirte west of Es Sider port where rebels were fighting pro-government forces assembled to end the blockages of oil ports.Rebel gunmen had blocked the gate to an air base in Sirte, the only main air force base in the region. Residents said fighters on both sides had been wounded though no details were immediately available.In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said.Western diplomats worry the conflict over oil might dismember Libya as rebels demand autonomy for the east, which was neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte.The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.They want to restore political autonomy with the historic eastern Cyrenaica region which shared power and wealth with Tripolitania in the west under King Idris, who preceded Gaddafi.Libya has been trying to rebuild its armed forces since Gaddafi's overthrow, but analysts say they are not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising against the veteran strongman.Tillerson first made the accusations on Tuesday, as diplomats from 29 countries met in Paris to push for sanctions and criminal charges against the perpetrators of the chemical attacks in Syria.Victims' families will speak about tragedy to public for first timeReport says new chief of police collaborated with drug dealers from his country in 2013'I am often the least racist person that anybody is going to meet.

Zeidan's government has received extensive criticism from both the parliament and the public for its failure to calm chaos and control rebel militias throughout the restive North African country since taking office after the oust of former dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011.The latest showcase of his leadership failure was the ability for eastern rebel groups to use a ship called The Morning Glory to independently export at least 234,000 barrels of crude. The vessel managed to escape to sea from Al Sidra earlier Tuesday even after Zeidan's government threatened arm action and air strikes to keep the tanker from reaching international waters.Zeidan, who was also previously abducted himself by rebel militias, has faced motions in parliament to resign in previous months. However, the General National Congress did not achieve the statutory quorum of 120 of its 194 members in the pass to implement the motion accordingly.  "	Business

The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it,"" said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.Abdelkader Houili, a member of the parliament's energy committee, told al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.""The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,"" he said.A second member of the parliament confirmed the vessel's escape. The official Lana news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the vessel, the Morning Glory, had slipped away. A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape.Libyan authorities said on Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for former rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil. The Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, was the first to do so.The stand-off at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels a day to just 250,000.The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the Opec member country may slide deeper into chaos.You are signed up.

941	" Related Libyan navy says surrounds N.Korea-flagged tanker outside rebel port  Libyan's parliament orders military operation against rebel ports   Libya sends navy to stop N.Korean tanker from taking oil from seized port  Libya threatens to bomb North Korean ship for 'illegal' oil 	The Libyan parliament was poised to vote Tuesday on a new motion to oust Prime Minister Ali Zeidan amid anger at his government's failure to stop eastern rebels from independently exporting oil.
	""The parliamentary factions are meeting. There is a consensus on bringing down the government. We are going to put it to the vote shortly,"" MP Suad Gannur told AFP.
	""The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those MPs who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative,"" she added.
	Zeidan's government has been repeatedly criticised for its failure to rein in the myriad of former rebel militias which have carved out their own fiefdoms since the NATO-backed uprising that ended the 42-year dictatorship of Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.
	The prime minister was himself briefly abducted by former rebel militia in the heart of the capital last October.
	But in a new humiliation for his government, a North Korean-flagged tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in the east slipped the warships deployed to intercept it and escaped to sea earlier Tuesday.
	The Morning Glory, which docked in Al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.
	Zeidan's government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.
	Zeidan, an independent elected with the support of liberals, has been the target of previous no-confidence motions in the General National Congress but they have never achieved the statutory quorum of 120 of its 194 members.
	Zeidan accuses his Islamist opponents of seeking to oust him solely to replace him with their own candidate.

943	"World Bulletin/News DeskA North Korean-flagged tanker that loaded crude oil at a rebel-held port in eastern Libya is in international waters after escaping the navy following a brief firefight, rebels at the harbour and a state oil company official said on Tuesday.In another worrying sign for the Tripoli government, gunmen blocked the gate to an airbase in Sirte, a city located close to the Es Sider port where rebels have sought to sell oil independently to get a greater share of Libya's mineral wealth.If the tanker's escape is confirmed, it would be a huge embarrassment for Tripoli.Top officials including Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said late on Monday the navy had seized the ship after the vessel loaded oil in Es Sider and was escorting it to a harbour controlled by the government.The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the OPEC member country may slide deeper into chaos or splinter as the government fails to rein in dozens of militias that helped oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but now defy state authority.A Reuters reporter at Es Sider port said there was no sign of any tanker but was unable to get more information on the whereabouts of the ship.Mohammad Hitab, spokesman for the state-run al-Waha Oil Company operating the port, said: ""The tanker left and is now in international waters.""He said he did not know the destination of the tanker, which Libyan officials say is owned by a Saudi company.Several rebels and port workers sympathising with them said the ship had left early in the morning, with boats escorting it into international waters.""We escorted the tanker out of the port at 3 a.m.,"" said a rebel fighter at the harbour. ""We came under fire from light arms (from the navy) but there were no casualties.""There were around 10 rebel vehicles mounted with guns inside the port, one of Libya's biggest export terminals.The Libyan navy and oil-related government officials declined to comment. An official in Zeidan's office said the government would issue a statement later. AIRPORT TAKENLocal residents said gunmen from the rebel force had entered the central city of Sirte and parked their combat vehicles at the entrance to the civilian airport and an airbase. The air force base is the only major one in the area.A rebel spokesman said his forces and pro-government militias had clashed in Sirte but Reuters could not verify this.On Monday, Libyan officials said the government would assemble forces to ""liberate"" all occupied ports, raising the stakes over a blockage that has cut off vital oil revenue.In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said.The rebels also demand autonomy for the east, which had been neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte.The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth in the North African country, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi's ousting, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled the dictator.Ibrahim Jathran, the leader of the protesters, is a former anti-Gaddafi commander who was in charge of protecting oilfields and ports until he turned against the government in the summer.His campaign to seek more rights for Libya's underdeveloped east has won him some sympathy, but many people dismiss him as a tribal warlord with no political vision.Tillerson first made the accusations on Tuesday, as diplomats from 29 countries met in Paris to push for sanctions and criminal charges against the perpetrators of the chemical attacks in Syria.Victims' families will speak about tragedy to public for first timeReport says new chief of police collaborated with drug dealers from his country in 2013'I am often the least racist person that anybody is going to meet.

947	"Tripoli, Libya (PANA)  - The North Korean tanker, which was seized by the Libyan military after loading an illegal shipment of crude oil from the Al- Sidera port being held by a separatist armed group in eastern Libya, has escaped from the North African nation, according to sources close to the Libyan National Congress (Parliament).

The oil tanker, named ''Glory morning”, escaped to international waters after shaking off the Libyan navy boats which had surrounded it, Abdelkader al- Houeily, member of the Committee on Energy of the Congress said on the al Nabaa - TV.

""The North Korean tanker took advantage of the bad weather to escape (from) the Libyan navy boats not designed to sail in bad weather conditions,"" he said.

On Monday night, contradictory information had circulated about who really controls the North Korean tanker, as Libyan government said it was under its control while the separatist armed group said it was in charge.

Last Saturday, the tanker docked at Al- Sedra, prompting Libyan authorities to send navy boats to prevent it from leaving the country's territorial waters.

The North Korean ship arrived at Libya's largest oil-export terminal Es Sider, in an attempt to purchase oil from Libyan rebels. Libya has been engulfed in a political crisis between its weak central government and rebel militias, which has slowed oil exports to a trickle. Oil production is down to 235,000 barrels per day compared to the 1.4 million bpd in mid-2013.Rebel militias in control of key ports hoped to illegally sell oil to a North Korean ship. The Libyan government ordered the armed forces to fire upon the ship, but the military refused, citing concern over safety of civilians and the desire to avoid an environmental disaster. Still, the government has promised to blow up the ship if it tries to follow through with oil exports.Libya's central government has struggled to consolidate power in the country after being torn apart during its revolution. Militias that battled Muammar Gaddafi have refused to submit to the central government. Some have declared their own independence from Tripoli. Exporting oil would be a big step for them and a major blow to the central government. In an effort to prevent breakaway territories from exporting oil, the government has promised to bomb any ships seeking to export oil from such areas. The Libyan navy fired upon a ship from Malta in January that attempted to load oil in Es Sider.The U.S. government expressed support for the Libyan government and stated that any illegal exports not sanctioned by Libya's National Oil Corporation amounted to ""theft"" from the Libyan people. The oil belongs to a joint venture run by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil, and Hess Corporation.Written by Charles Kennedy at Oilprice.com.None"	Business

The oil tanker flying a North Korean flag is docked. But Libya's central authorities are attempting to seize the vessel..Why? Since August, eastern separatists have seized three major ports. The arrival of the tanker is just the latest of several steps to take a larger share of national oil wealth and create an autonomous state.Since summer 2013 a band of armed men led by Ibrahim Jathran began seizing oil fields and ports in the north-east, where most of Libya's oil also happens to be concentrated. He operates under the auspices of a group known as the Cyrenaica Political Bureau (CPB) that has since proclaimed itself as the governing authority of the region. Threats to illicitly sell crude oil to rogue buyers have hung in the air for months. To the dismay of the central government led by prime minister Ali Zeidan, this is a potent weapon in the arsenal they are using to bargain for power.The inability of the central government to intervene in this episode provides another example of their powerlessness. Threats to bomb the ship are empty ones. Ultimatums issued to militias by the government have repeatedly failed from the earliest days of the transition. As time wears on and warnings go either unheard or are met with violent force in response, the value of such statements becomes laughable. While improvements in naval capacity have been made in the past year, and naval forces have the capacity to mobilise and fire, land security rests in the hands of the country's scattered militias rather than a national army.Attempts have been made to co-opt the various armed groups under a range of state umbrellas with varied success. Several government-aligned brigades – Misrata, February 17, Libya Shield – oppose Jathran's manoeuvring and are standing against him. Jathran was, in fact, once the head of the state force tasked with protecting oil production, the Petroleum Facilities Guard. The ease of movement this afforded him allowed him to usurp three ports – at Ras Lanuf, Zeitina and Sidra – and remain in control.The number of men under his command remains unknown, with estimates ranging anywhere from 2,000-20,000, and the extent of his popular backing is debatable. Most Libyans see his actions as theft and his claims of regional authority as bluster. He and many of the ministers of the CPB are either non- or anti-Islamist. This automatically places him at odds with forces aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood or other religiously motivated groups. Libya's east is dominated by Islamist militias that may stand directly against him. The primary factor, however, is that Jathran is not paying most of their salaries – the central government is.Jathran continues to pay and arm his own forces, however. As there have been no known takers of his offer to sell Libya's high-quality crude on an illegal basis, the sources of his funding are a mystery. It is suspected that wealthy Libyan businessmen are financing his army, and for roughly the same amount as the value of the oil in the ship – $30m. At this point, however, all that is conjecture.The other salient mystery point remains: whose ship is it and for whom is the oil ultimately intended? It is known that it was at one stage owned by a registered Gulf oil company, but the details beyond this remain hazy. It could be that the ship, renamed Morning Glory, belongs to North Korea, but this is also doubtful. One must question why a state so monitored by western intelligence agencies would fly its flag in the middle of the Mediterranean, all the while attempting to steal oil from US companies. Some major firms – Exxon, BP, Royal Dutch Shell – have halted operations and pulled staff from Libya, but several others remain. Sidra port in particular is owned by Waha Oil, a National Oil Corporation company that is in partnership with US-owned Marathon, ConocoPhilips, and Hess. This may have been a factor in the quick response by the US – threatening sanctions if an illegal sale were made.The tanker remains in port, full of oil, and in a stand-off with the Libyan navy and government-aligned militias. If Jathran and the CPB are able to sustain this scenario, they may have the best opportunity yet to establish the autonomous state they seek. But it is also possible they will simply alienate themselves from the majority of nations operating under international law. Or, and perhaps more likely, they are setting the stage for renewed civil conflict in Libya if negotiations with Tripoli fail."	Business
951	"TRIPOLI, Libya, March 11 (UPI) --  A spokesman for Libya's General National Congress said a North Korean-flagged oil tanker was intercepted by military forces and escorted to the Misurata port.Libya's National Oil Corp. said Monday the tanker Morning Glory had taken on a load of crude oil illegally from Sidra, a port under rebel control in eastern Libya. Omar Hemidan, a spokesman for the General National Congress, confirmed to the Libya Herald the tanker was intercepted and was on its way to the port at Misurata.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan threatened to use force against the North Korean-flagged ship. The Libyan company said it would pursue ""all of its remedies"" to protect its interests ""and to hold responsible all the parties participating in illicit transactions relating to it in any jurisdiction, both within and outside of Libya.""Libya's oil production has suffered as a result of ongoing security issues and internal rivalries. Libyan militia leader Ibrahim Jadran seized the eastern port of Sidra in July. Last week, Italian energy company Eni said Libya was an important natural gas partner for the region, though BP said it was exploring other options for exploration drilling onshore in Libya because of security concerns.United Press International is a leading provider of news, photos and information to millions of readers around the globe via UPI.com and its licensing services.

Sunday Jan 28,2018The tanker was seeking to export crude from a rebel-held port, according to the national oil company.March 11, 2014Updated: March 11, 2014 04:00 AMLibya’s navy impounded a tanker that was seeking to export crude from a rebel-held port, according to the national oil company, as the government battles to reassert control over its main source of revenue.The tanker was taken from Es Sider, Libya’s biggest export terminal, to a port under government control, said Mohamed Elharari, a spokesman for National Oil. The destination is Qasr Ahmed port in Misrata in western Libya, the official Lana news agency said.Libya’s inability to restore oil exports from its eastern terminals was among the reasons cited by Citigroup when it raised its 2014 forecast for Brent crude to US$103 a barrel from $93 a barrel on February 25. The country is pumping about 275,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with 1.4 million bpd last July.Brent futures trading on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange fell 0.9 per cent to $107.97 a barrel.The self-declared authorities in eastern Libya are demanding that Barqa, the local name for the region that usually produces more than half of the country’s oil, receives 15 per cent of national crude revenue. Mr Elharari identified the ship yesterday as the North Korea-flagged Morning Glory, with a capacity of 350,000 barrels. It changed name from the Gulf Glory on February 27 and also started flying the Asian country’s flag on that date too, having previously flown the flag of Liberia, he said. There is another tanker with the name Morning Glory that is unrelated to the one off Libya’s coast.The registered owner of the Gulf Glory is Sea Pride Shipping in Sharjah in the UAE, according to a European Commission database.“Sea Pride Shipping can confirm it is the registered owner of the vessel Gulf Glory but is currently in dispute with the vessels operators,” Sea Pride said. “Sea Pride Shipping currently has no operational control over the vessel, including where she operates and what cargo she may be carrying.”The ship’s cargo would be valued at about $38 million at the current price for Brent crude, the benchmark for Es Sider grade. The crude loaded on the tanker belongs to Waha Oil, a joint venture between the national oil companies Marathon Oil, Hess and ConocoPhillips, according to the state-owned company.business@thenational.aeFollow us on Twitter @Ind_InsightsWATCH: The Week That Was with Tim MarshallWinter storm brings snow to Saudi Arabia and Lebanon - in picturesWhy ageing in Dubai is a particularly painful processOut on a limb: Vanity Fair's curious cover'Riots' in France over Nutella discountsAs China successfully clones monkeys, is this the start of a sci-fi nightmare?Prince Al Waleed has been released, say family sources'Riots' in France over Nutella discountsCrown Prince offers condolences to family of UAE servicemanDubai Economy clarifies Fitness First VAT disputeView the paper as it appeared in printDownload the iPad e-reader"	Business
953	"First Published: 2014-03-11By Imed Lamloum – TRIPOLILibya blames bad weather A North Korean-flagged tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya slipped the warships deployed to intercept it and escaped to sea on Tuesday, MPs said.The Morning Glory, which docked in Al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.The central government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.But members of the General National Congress, Libya's highest political authority, said that bad weather prevented the navy's small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean.""The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea.

954	"World Bulletin/News DeskA North Korean-flagged tanker that loaded crude oil at a rebel-held port in eastern Libya is in international waters after escaping the navy following a brief firefight, rebels at the harbour and a state oil company official said on Tuesday.In another worrying sign for the Tripoli government, gunmen blocked the gate to an airbase in Sirte, a city located close to the Es Sider port where rebels have sought to sell oil independently to get a greater share of Libya's mineral wealth.If the tanker's escape is confirmed, it would be a huge embarrassment for Tripoli.Top officials including Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said late on Monday the navy had seized the ship after the vessel loaded oil in Es Sider and was escorting it to a harbour controlled by the government.The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the OPEC member country may slide deeper into chaos or splinter as the government fails to rein in dozens of militias that helped oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but now defy state authority.A Reuters reporter at Es Sider port said there was no sign of any tanker but was unable to get more information on the whereabouts of the ship.Mohammad Hitab, spokesman for the state-run al-Waha Oil Company operating the port, said: ""The tanker left and is now in international waters.""He said he did not know the destination of the tanker, which Libyan officials say is owned by a Saudi company.Several rebels and port workers sympathising with them said the ship had left early in the morning, with boats escorting it into international waters.""We escorted the tanker out of the port at 3 a.m.,"" said a rebel fighter at the harbour. ""We came under fire from light arms (from the navy) but there were no casualties.""There were around 10 rebel vehicles mounted with guns inside the port, one of Libya's biggest export terminals.The Libyan navy and oil-related government officials declined to comment. An official in Zeidan's office said the government would issue a statement later. AIRPORT TAKENLocal residents said gunmen from the rebel force had entered the central city of Sirte and parked their combat vehicles at the entrance to the civilian airport and an airbase. The air force base is the only major one in the area.A rebel spokesman said his forces and pro-government militias had clashed in Sirte but Reuters could not verify this.On Monday, Libyan officials said the government would assemble forces to ""liberate"" all occupied ports, raising the stakes over a blockage that has cut off vital oil revenue.In Tripoli and the western city of Misrata, armed young men could be seen gathering to join a government force, residents said.The rebels also demand autonomy for the east, which had been neglected under Gaddafi as he concentrated power and wealth in Tripoli as well as his home region of Sirte.The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth in the North African country, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi's ousting, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled the dictator.Ibrahim Jathran, the leader of the protesters, is a former anti-Gaddafi commander who was in charge of protecting oilfields and ports until he turned against the government in the summer.His campaign to seek more rights for Libya's underdeveloped east has won him some sympathy, but many people dismiss him as a tribal warlord with no political vision.Tillerson first made the accusations on Tuesday, as diplomats from 29 countries met in Paris to push for sanctions and criminal charges against the perpetrators of the chemical attacks in Syria.Victims' families will speak about tragedy to public for first timeReport says new chief of police collaborated with drug dealers from his country in 2013'I am often the least racist person that anybody is going to meet.

	The government says it is satisfied with REMPEC’s oil spill prevention efforts, but Environment Minister Leo Brincat yesterday refused to go into detail regarding preparations for a possible ecological disaster in the Mediterranean as the Libyan government has stepped up its threats of blowing up an oil tanker loaded with “illicit oil”.
	The situation in Libya has turned from bad to worse as rebels in command of a number of ports are trying to export oil illegally from the country from three ports they occupied months ago.
	The ship in question – the North Korean flagged ‘Morning Glory’ – is currently moored in Al-Sidra port, near Ras Lanuf, some 300 kilometres from Malta. Libyan officials said on Monday that the ship had finished loading its bunkers with illegal oil, estimated to be worth some $36 million.
	The Libyan authorities yesterday turned things up a notch, with the country’s Culture Minister, Al-Habib al-Amin insisting that the ship would be blown out of the water should it attempt to leave port. “It is final and decisive. Any attempt by the tanker to move and it will be turned into scrap.”
	The tanker is currently besieged by Libyan Navy ships and loyalist militias, who insisted that if the ship did not surrender it would be “shelled completely.” According to reports the loyalist militias have placed 22 fishing vessels armed with mortar and rocket launchers around the tanker. 
	But the rebels have insisted that an attack on the vessel would be considered an act of war and they would retaliate. Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement, said: ""harming any tanker or sending navy ships into the waters of Cyrenaica. It the tanker is harmed the response from Cyrenaica's defense forces, oil guards and revolutionaries will be decisive. Such a move would be a declaration of war.""
	 
Situation could turn into an ecological disaster
	Sources told this paper that any attack on the ship could result in an ecological disaster off the coast of Libya with thousands of tons of oil pouring into the Mediterrenean.
	When asked if he was concerned by these developments Environment Minister Leo Brincat said that the government had taken immediate action.
	“The moment we were alerted about the problem we took immediate action and asked REMPEC to take all the necessary measures. This was done to our satisfaction throughout Sunday wherein we were kept updated about the situation.”
	REMPEC is the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea, which is based in Malta. However, when asked to be more specific on these “necessary measures” Mr Brincat curtly replied that “he has nothing to add.”
	 
A result of the post- Gaddafi Libya
	The port of Al-Sidra has been under militia control since the summer, slowing the country's oil output — once estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day — to a trickle. For months the Libyan government has been threatening to use force against the Eastern militias, who are demanding greater self-rule and equal distribution of the oil wealth. Libya has been gripped by unrest since the ousting of dictator Muammar Ghaddafi in 2011 as militias from different tribes have seized power over different areas and refused to give up control, and their weapons.
	Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said on Sunday that he had given the order for more troops to move into the al-Sidra area and the Prosecutor General has issued an arrest warrant for the tanker captain and its crew members. He also ordered the tanker to be confiscated.
	It seems that the Libyan government has Washington’s backing. The US Department of State said on Sunday that it was deeply concerned by reports that a tanker is loading illicitly obtained oil.
	“This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people,” it said, insisting that the oil belongs to the Libyan government and private oil companies, including US firms.
	On the other hand experts have noted that the ship is not actually controlled by Pyongyang but is likely to be using the North Korean flag as a flag of convenience.

Rebels deny losing control of North Korean-flagged tanker; Government says tanker being taken to western port. Oil blockade has slashed vital government revenues.

By Ulf Laessing and Ghaith Shennib

Libya on Monday stopped a North Korean-flagged tanker that had loaded oil from a rebel-held port, after naval forces briefly exchanged fire with the rebels, officials said.

But in a sign of the chaos and conflicting information typical for Libya, rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran denied in a televised statement broadcast from a ship that he had lost control of the oil tanker.

The LIbyan officials also said the government will assemble forces to ""liberate"" all occupied ports, raising the stakes over a blockage that has cut off vital oil revenue.

The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the OPEC producer may slide deeper into chaos or even splinter as the fragile government fails to rein in dozens of militias that helped oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but now defy state authority.

The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth in the North African country, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack.

Prime Minister Ali Zeidan told Reuters naval forces had seized the North Korean-flagged tanker outside the eastern Es Sider port controlled by rebels and were taking it to a government port in western Libya.

""The ship is around 20 miles from Es Sider,"" Zeidan said. ""It stopped due to darkness and won't move tonight but is under complete control and secured. Tomorrow it will move.""

Naval forces had halted the ship after a brief firefight with the rebels, Culture Minister and government spokesman Habib al-Amin later told reporters. Nobody had been wounded, but he warned opening fire again might damage nearby oil facilities.

But rebel leader Jathran appeared on the television station of his movement after midnight and denied Tripoli's forces had surrounded the tanker.

Speaking from a ship, Jathran vowed to keep selling oil independently of the government, and blasted the United States for earlier criticizing the crude loading. The station did not identify the ship he was standing on, but it appeared to be smaller than the 37,000-tonne oil tanker.

Even without any major military action, the escalation kills any hope of restoring oil exports soon. A wave of protests at oilfields and ports has reduced Libyan output to a trickle, undermining state authority because oil is the main revenue source supporting the budget and basic food imports.

The head of parliament, who has quasi-presidential powers, ordered the formation of a force made up of regular soldiers and allied militias to take back the occupied ports, which previously handled more than 700,000 barrels of oil per day.

The operation will start within one week, parliament head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain said in a decree published by spokesman Omar Hmeidan. ""The force will be set up to liberate the ports and end the blockage,"" Hmeidan told Reuters.

Zeidan, who said on Saturday the tanker would be bombed if it tried to export oil, said military action was only one of several options.

""What is confirmed it that all ports will be liberated from the occupiers with all means possible,"" he said. ""We prefer talks but if talks fail then the state will act.""

Zeidan said authorities would unload the crude from the tanker once it reached a western port and then launch legal measures against the potential buyers.

DEFIANT REBELS
Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi's ousting, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled the dictator.

Still, the force will be drawn from cities such as Misrata that are home to fighters who saw battle in the civil war, according to the decree. Misrata forces were sent earlier this year to fight in clashes deep in Libya's south.

Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, the self-declared rebel prime minister, called on ""all honourable men"" in the east to join his forces, a rebel television station reported.

The rebels, made up of former oil security guards, said they had sent forces by land and sea to central Libya to confront any government attackers.

FULL CONFRONTATION UNLIKELY
While the navy did open fire on a Maltese-flagged tanker trying to approach Es Sider in January, analysts say a full military confrontation with the rebels would be unlikely.

Jathran, the leader of the protesters, is a former anti-Gaddafi commander who was in charge of protecting oilfields and ports until he turned against the government in the summer.

His campaign to seek more rights for Libya's underdeveloped east has won him some sympathy, but many people dismiss him as a tribal warlord with no political vision.

Libya's top Islamic clerics urged militias who had helped topple Gaddafi to help the government in trying to stop the tanker, according to a statement read on television.

The United Nations' special envoy to Libya, Tarek Mitri, told the U.N. Security Council on Monday that the loading of oil onto the North Korean-flagged vessel ""constitutes an illegal act and violates Libya's sovereignty over its ports and natural resources"".

On Sunday, Tripoli said the navy and pro-government militias had sent boats to stop the tanker from leaving. The vessel had arrived at Es Sider on Saturday.

It is unusual for a tanker flagged to secretive North Korea to sail in the Mediterranean. Shipping sources said it was a flag of convenience to keep the ship's ownership secret.

A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an ""illegal"" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were escorting it to port on Tuesday, MPs said.Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading Al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil but the North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, is the first to actually do so.

It was stopped as it tried to leave Sidra port but has not yet reached a government-controlled port, they add.

Though Jadran’s militia controls the port, it does not own the oil. That belongs to the Waha Oil, a joint venture between Libya’s state-run National Oil Company and three western companies: Marathon, Hess, and ConocoPhillips.According to a report from Bloomberg News, the Morning Glory can carry about 350,000 barrels of oil. At today’s prices that would be about $38 million in ill-gotten proceeds.Prime minister Ali Zeidan threatened to blow up the tanker should it try to leave with any of the oil. When the army refused his orders to fire on the ship, Zeidan sent in a government-backed task force to take control of the tanker, which began loading crude on Sunday night, according to The Guardian. As of Monday evening, the tanker was being escorted to a government-controlled port in western Libya.Militia leader Jadran maintained that he was merely trying to circumvent the country’s notorious corruption and sell the oil on behalf of the Libyan people. The Libyan government—and most analysts, for that matter—contend that Jadran was trying to steal the oil and keep the money for himself. On Sunday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki issued a statement calling the oil “illicitly obtained,” and that selling it “amounts to theft from the Libyan people.”Having North Korea show up as the apparent buyer adds little legitimacy to Jadran’s case. When you’re trying to sell oil on the world’s black market, who else do you call but Pyongyang?This is the latest bit of chaos to ripple through Libya, which has been stuck in a deep power vaccum since militias took control of the country’s three biggest ports last summer. Libya’s oil exports have slowed to a trickle, starving the government—and thereby the economy—of its main source of revenue. The Libyan parliament has been meeting in a hotel since protestors stormed the legislative building with knives and guns last week, killing a guard and wounding six lawmakers.Though it’s also true in such places as Nigeria and Venezuela, nowhere does power more completely flow through a country’s oil supply than in Libya. Controlling Libya’s oil is to dominate Libya.Zeidan’s big mistake appears to have come last summer, when he entrusted the security of Libya’s ports to Jadran and his militia. Though he thwarted the sale of Libyan oil to North Korea, it’s tough to see how Zeidan can wrest back control of the country’s ports and ultimately, the ability to restart the country’s economy. “I’m not sure there is a step that he can take that is not a misstep,” says Sarah Emerson, an energy analyst and principle at ESAI Energy. Karim Mezran, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, says the only way forward is to hold new elections. “Zeidan has lost,” says Mezran. “He’s too weak to take back power.”The world could certainly use Libya’s oil supply. The country holds Africa’s largest oil reserves, boasting some of the highest-grade crude in the world. Yet the tap has basically been turned off since the 2011 revolution. With no way to export oil, Libya has cut production. The country now pumps about 275,000 barrels a day, compared with 1.4 million barrels daily last July.	Business

969	Africa / 11 March 2014, 09:52am / Ulf Laessing and Ghaith ShennibTripoli - Libya on Monday stopped a North Korean-flagged tanker that had loaded oil from a rebel-held port, after naval forces briefly exchanged fire with the rebels, officials said. But in a sign of the chaos and conflicting information typical for Libya, rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran denied in a televised statement broadcast from a ship that he had lost control of the oil tanker. The LIbyan officials also said the government will assemble forces to “liberate” all occupied ports, raising the stakes over a blockage that has cut off vital oil revenue. The conflict over oil wealth is increasing fears that the Opec producer may slide deeper into chaos or even splinter as the fragile government fails to rein in dozens of militias that helped oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but now defy state authority. The rebels, who have seized three ports and partly control a fourth in the North African country, said they had dispatched forces to central Libya to deal with any government attack. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan told Reuters naval forces had seized the North Korean-flagged tanker outside the eastern Es Sider port controlled by rebels and were taking it to a government port in western Libya. “The ship is around 20 miles from Es Sider,” Zeidan said. “It stopped due to darkness and won't move tonight but is under complete control and secured. Tomorrow it will move.” Naval forces had halted the ship after a brief firefight with the rebels, Culture Minister and government spokesman Habib al-Amin later told reporters. Nobody had been wounded, but he warned opening fire again might damage nearby oil facilities. But rebel leader Jathran appeared on the television station of his movement after midnight and denied Tripoli's forces had surrounded the tanker. Speaking from a ship, Jathran vowed to keep selling oil independently of the government, and blasted the United States for earlier criticising the crude loading. The station did not identify the ship he was standing on, but it appeared to be smaller than the 37 000-ton oil tanker. Even without any major military action, the escalation kills any hope of restoring oil exports soon. A wave of protests at oilfields and ports has reduced Libyan output to a trickle, undermining state authority because oil is the main revenue source supporting the budget and basic food imports. The head of parliament, who has quasi-presidential powers, ordered the formation of a force made up of regular soldiers and allied militias to take back the occupied ports, which previously handled more than 700 000 barrels of oil per day. The operation will start within one week, parliament head Nuri Ali Abu Sahmain said in a decree published by spokesman Omar Hmeidan. “The force will be set up to liberate the ports and end the blockage,” Hmeidan told Reuters. Zeidan, who said on Saturday the tanker would be bombed if it tried to export oil, said military action was only one of several options. “What is confirmed it that all ports will be liberated from the occupiers with all means possible,” he said. “We prefer talks but if talks fail then the state will act.” Zeidan said authorities would unload the crude from the tanker once it reached a western port and then launch legal measures against the potential buyers.Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi's ousting, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled the dictator. Still, the force will be drawn from cities such as Misrata that are home to fighters who saw battle in the civil war, according to the decree. Misrata forces were sent earlier this year to fight in clashes deep in Libya's south. Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, the self-declared rebel prime minister, called on “all honourable men” in the east to join his forces, a rebel television station reported.

979	"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - A tanker that loaded oil from a rebel-held port in eastern Libya has been halted by government forces but it has not yet reached a port controlled by government forces, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan told Reuters on Monday.Oil officials said earlier navy forces had seized the North Korea-flagged tanker outside the rebel-held Es Sider port to escort it to a government-controlled port in western Libya.Giving the first details of the operation, Prime Minister Zeidan said the tanker was not yet in western Libya. ""The ship is around 20 miles from Es Sider,"" he said in an interview.""It stopped due to darkness and won't move tonight but is under complete control and secured. Tomorrow it will move.""Authorities would unload the crude from the tanker once it reached a western port and then launch legal measures against the potential buyers.Zeidan also said Libya would end the blockade of all rebel ports in the east either through talks or by military force.""What is confirmed it that all ports will be liberated from the occupiers with all means possible,"" he said. ""We prefer talks but if talks fail then the state will act,"" he said.(Reporting by Ulf Laessing)"	Business

983	Reuters Staff5 Min Read* Posts 14 bln-euro loss on goodwill and bad loans writedowns * Says won’t need capital increase, to cut 8,500 jobs * Bank says to list Fineco unit, to issue additional Tier 1 bond * Shares up 6 percent on balance sheet clean-up   (Adds job cuts, internal bad bank, bonds, CEO’s comments, 2014 profit target) By Silvia Aloisi and Gianluca Semeraro MILAN, March 11 (Reuters) - UniCredit posted a record 14 billion-euro ($19 billion) loss on Tuesday due to huge writedowns on bad loans and past acquisitions as it moved to clean up its balance sheet ahead of an industry-wide health check by European regulators. Italy’s biggest bank by assets said full-year provisions against losses from loans totalled 13.7 billion euros in 2013, with 9.3 billion euros in the fourth quarter alone. “This is a jaw-dropping clean-up,” said one banking analyst, who declined to be named. “The company is taking 9.3 billion euros of loan losses. We had (forecast) 4.5 billion euros and thought we were high.” Yet UniCredit shares rallied after an initial drop, as the bank said it did not need to carry out a capital increase and felt it had done more than will be required to get a clean bill of health by regulators when the European Central Bank conducts its asset quality review of the euro zone’s 128 biggest banks. UniCredit’s share price was up 7 percent at 6.46 euros by 1604 GMT, its highest level since October 2011 and extending gains this year to 20.3 percent, compared with a 4 percent rise in the Stoxx Europe 600 banking sector index. “I believe the group has turned the page. We could have staggered the losses over several years. We decided to take them all in one year,” Chief Executive Federico Ghizzoni told reporters. In addition to the bad loan provisions the bank also booked in goodwill impairments totalling 9.3 billion euros as it effectively wrote down the entire value of its acquisitions  since 2005. That year UniCredit became a major force in Europe through the purchase of Germany’s HypoVereinsbank and its extensive operations in Central and Eastern Europe. The massive net loss, one of the worst suffered by a European bank since the beginning of the financial crisis, was partly mitigated by a 1.2 billion-euro net capital gain recorded for the revaluation of UniCredit’s stake in the Bank of Italy, whose accounting treatment is still under discussion. Analysts had on average expected the bank to report a net profit of 916.5 million euros in 2013, up from the net profit of 865 million euros reported for 2012, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S Estimates. The bank also launched a restructuring plan on Tuesday which aims for 8,500 job cuts by 2018 - nearly 6 percent of its workforce - for which it took a 700 million-euro charge in the fourth quarter. In addition it will create an internal “bad bank” to manage 87 billion euros of bad and risky loans. These will be reduced to 33 billion euros in the next five years, Ghizzoni said. The bank will also list a minority stake in its online unit Fineco, issue so-called additional Tier 1 bonds and will propose a scrip dividend of 0.10 euros a share for 2013, payable in shares, to further boost its capital. “Investors are looking favourably at the kitchen sinking, and how they cleaned up the balance sheet through large loan loss charges, because it allows them to draw a line and move on,” said Alberto Gallo, credit analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. UniCredit, which unveiled its 2013-2018 business plan along with the results, said it was targeting a net profit of around 2 billion euros for 2014 and an ambitious return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 13 percent in 2018. Ghizzoni said his hopes for a quick turnaround were based on signs that economic activity in UniCredit’s Italian home base was picking up after two and half years of recession. “For the first time in January we saw a decline in the stock (of bad debts) for corporates,” he said, adding that the bank’s targets were based on prudent economic forecasts for Italy, where UniCredit makes 40 percent of its revenues. The bank said that after the clean-up, its impaired loan coverage ratio of 52 percent was the highest in Italy and one of the best in Europe. UniCredit also said its fully-loaded Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio, a closely-watched measure of a bank’s financial strength, stood at 9.4 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of 2013. That will rise by 0.3 percentage points once the Fineco listing and other capital boosting moves are completed, the bank said, putting it well above an 8 percent minimum requirement set by the ECB, despite the heavy writedowns.

UniCredit shocks with 14 billion euro balance sheet clean-upShare this articleLeading Italian bank UniCredit has posted a massive loss of 14 billion euros for 2013.Much of that was as it wrote off bad loans that it knows will never be repaid, along with so-called goodwill – the paper value of assets – in Italy, Austria and central and eastern Europe.The writedowns are to clean up its balance sheet ahead of checks on the financial health of European lenders by the region’s regulators.Without them Unicredit would have made a 916.5 million euros net profit in 2013, according to the consensus of forecasts from a poll of analysts carried out by Thomson Reuters It will also cut 8,500 jobs by 2018 There will be 5,700 layoffs in Italy, 1,500 in Germany and 900 in Austria. The bank sharply wrote down the value of its acquisitions since 2005 which was when it became a major force in Europe through the purchase of Germany’s HypoVereinsbank and its extensive operations in Central and Eastern Europe.It will sell its Ukrainian subsidiary and has set aside 600 million euros to cover losses on that. Unicredit is also planning to list its Fineco online banking unit and to sell its bad loans management unit.The moves were welcomed in the financial markets which noted Italy’s biggest bank in terms of assets is not going to have to raise more capital. UniCredit’s shares rose 6.04 percent.Share this article

985	" Italy’s largest bank Unicredit said yesterday it had suffered a staggering €14bn ($19.4bn) loss last year as it wrote down the value of assets and increased its loan loss provisions.
The bank also unveiled a strategic plan that targets generating over €6bn in annual net profits in four years.
The loss was essentially due to writing down the value of assets by €9.3bn and increasing reserves to cover at risk loans by €7.2bn in the final quarter of last year.
It also took a restructuring charge of €699mn.
Unicredit, which posted a net profit of €865mn in 2012, also announced a plan under which it quickly intends to boost profitability.
“Whilst in 2014 we estimate a net profit around €2bn, we intend to more than triple this to €6.6bn in 2018,” chief executive Federico Ghizzoni was quoted as saying.
The bank also said it intends to distribute about 40% of profits to shareholders.
Ghizzoni said the strategic plan “is based on solid fundamentals, a strong risk culture and an improving macro-economic climate.”
He said this involves investment of €4.5bn to grow revenues and to cut an additional €1.3bn in costs.
The bank said it has made considerable progress in reducing the risk in its business, with its leverage ratio down to assets of 19 times its capital from 32 before the global financial crisis struck.
And it has reduced its funding gap to €29bn from 163bn, while increasing its coverage rate for impaired loans and capital base ratios.Italy’s largest bank Unicredit said yesterday it had suffered a staggering €14bn ($19.4bn) loss last year as it wrote down the value of assets and increased its loan loss provisions.The bank also unveiled a strategic plan that targets generating over €6bn in annual net profits in four years.The loss was essentially due to writing down the value of assets by €9.3bn and increasing reserves to cover at risk loans by €7.2bn in the final quarter of last year.It also took a restructuring charge of €699mn.Unicredit, which posted a net profit of €865mn in 2012, also announced a plan under which it quickly intends to boost profitability.“Whilst in 2014 we estimate a net profit around €2bn, we intend to more than triple this to €6.6bn in 2018,” chief executive Federico Ghizzoni was quoted as saying.The bank also said it intends to distribute about 40% of profits to shareholders.Ghizzoni said the strategic plan “is based on solid fundamentals, a strong risk culture and an improving macro-economic climate.”He said this involves investment of €4.5bn to grow revenues and to cut an additional €1.3bn in costs.The bank said it has made considerable progress in reducing the risk in its business, with its leverage ratio down to assets of 19 times its capital from 32 before the global financial crisis struck.And it has reduced its funding gap to €29bn from 163bn, while increasing its coverage rate for impaired loans and capital base ratios.There are no comments.

991	"Reuters Staff3 Min Read* Unidentified suitor has submitted non-binding offer * Sale seen within 12 months, hinge on return of stability * UniCredit joins ranks of banks exiting Ukraine   (Adds quotes and background) VIENNA, March 11 (Reuters) - UniCredit has joined the exodus of foreign banks from Ukraine, putting its local unit up for sale in a deal it hopes to wrap up within a year should political and economic turmoil in the country settle down. The Italian bank’s central and eastern European arm, Bank Austria, said an unidentified suitor had submitted a non-binding offer for the Ukrsotskbank business before the uprising that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich last month. Talks continued despite unrest and a standoff with Russia, whose forces control the Crimean peninsula. The sale talks were “of course subject to a normalisation of the political and economic environment, which by the way we are quite confident will take place,” Bank Austria finance chief Francesco Giordano told reporters. “Naturally the conversation may take somewhat longer and is a bit less certain of execution in the current circumstances.” The Ukrainian business was valued at 0.7 times equity value, he said. Reclassification of the Ukrainian bank as an asset held for sale and its operating loss in 2013 hit profits by around 250 million euros ($347 million), Bank Austria said. UniCredit CEE head Gianni Franco Papa said as recently as December that the bank would not walk away lightly from Ukraine, where it merged two units last year to give it around 3.3 billion euros in assets, 435 branches and 6,200 staff. Raiffeisen Bank International has put plans to sell its Ukrainian business on hold for now. Among banks which have pared back in Ukraine are Germany’s Commerzbank, which sold its Bank Forum unit in 2012; Austria’s Erste Group, which sold its loss-making unit in 2012; and Sweden’s Swedbank, which sold its subsidiary last year. Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo said in January it would sell its Ukrainian unit to a unit of Ukraine-based Group DF. Foreign banks that remain may have to choose between cutting their losses or holding on to grab market share. Ukraine was badly hit by the financial crisis when GDP plunged 15 percent in 2009. Government coffers were depleted by huge debt repayments, efforts to protect the currency and high energy costs. Support from the International Monetary Fund is seen as critical to shore up Ukraine’s collapsing finances and get its economy back on the right track. Ukraine’s finance minister has said he hoped the IMF would work on an aid package of at least $15 billion. That figure would be in line with the IMF’s last loan to Ukraine in 2010. $1 = 0.7205 Euros

UniCredit, Italy's largest bank, on Tuesday posted a record 15 billion-euro ($21 billion) loss in the fourth quarter as it cleaned up its balance sheet with write-downs and provisions, part of an attempt to turn the page on its troubled past.The loss compares with a 553 million-euro shortfall in the fourth quarter a year earlier, and exceeded the bank's previous record loss of 10.6 billion euros posted for the third quarter of 2011 on bad Greek debt and other write-downs.The balance sheet cleanup, which includes more than doubling provisions for bad loans to 9.3 billion euros, comes as the European Central Bank starts a big review of the region's banks. The review will identify weak spots in banks' finances and, if needed, ask them to fix them.Despite the stunning loss, markets reacted favorably to UniCredit's aggressive balance sheet cleanup, sending shares up 7 percent to 6.48 euros.The bank said its strategic plan through 2018 would foresee a net profit of 2 billion euros this year, tripling to 6.6 billion in 2018. It includes cutting 8,500 jobs, 5,700 of those in Italy, leading to savings of 700 million euros by 2018.It also plans to publicly list its on-line bank Fineco, and look at selling its collections platform in Italy to a specialist in the field.CEO Federico Ghizzoni called 2013 ""a turning point,"" and said the bank was posed to increase lending ""and support the real economy in Italy and in Europe.""Unicredit said that its underlying financials were improving. In the fourth quarter, it reported higher net interest income and improved fees and commissions, helping to boost revenues by 5.2 percent to 6 billion euros.

995	"  The chief executive of UniCredit  has told CNBC the bank will focus on ""growth and profitability"" after reporting a record annual net loss of 14 billion euros ($19.4 billion) for 2013, largely due to massive writedowns.    Federico Ghizzoni said the bank's surprise balance-sheet clear-out came amid efforts to put the past behind it and look forward.    Despite the loss, shares in the bank rallied over 6 percent on Tuesday as investors welcomed the move by Italy's largest lender by assets. Sentiment was also boosted by the bank's ruling out of the need for a capital increase.   (Read more: Bad loan triggers key feature in ECB bank test)  ""The intention was to close (put an end) to the past and look forward,"" Ghizzoni told CNBC.    ""We have created the conditions where we have strong capital to look to the future with more optimism and we can concentrate now on growth again and profitability that is very needed.""   UniCredit reported loan-loss provisions of 13.7 billion euros for 2013, with 9.3 billion euros recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.    But Ghizzoni defended the bank's decision not to create a so-called ""bad bank"" – which buys up a lender's toxic assets – despite a number of other Europe lenders, such as Bankia, opting for this.    (Read more: Bad loans at European banks hit $1.7 trillion)  ""We have not created a separate legal entity because from a fiscal and legal point of view there is no benefit, at least in Italy, to go in this direction,"" he said. ""Instead, we decided to segregate the portfolio inside the bank… It is very similar. In the end the purpose is to try to work with a dual approach.""   The bank said its impaired loan coverage ratio was now 52 percent – marking a return to pre-crisis levels and ""by far"" the highest in Italy.   It also reported ""strong capital,"" with a tier one common capital ratio of 10.4 percent, which is especially important given the European Central Bank's stress tests of banks' balance sheets.       UniCredit unveiled its strategic plan until 2018, which it said was, ""based on solid fundamentals, a strong risk culture and an improving macro-economic climate.""   For 2014, UniCredit estimates net profit to come in around 2 billion euros, and it expects this to rise to 6.6 billion euros by 2018. PlayingShare this video...Watch Next..."	Business
