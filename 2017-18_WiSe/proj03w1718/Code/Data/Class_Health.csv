About one in three parents use their mobile phones nearly nonstop while eating at a restaurant with their young children, a new study suggests.      

Researchers observed that when parents were almost constantly engrossed in their phones, kids tended to act out, although some kids also seemed to accept the lack of attention and conversation, and entertained themselves, the researchers found.

""Caregivers who were highly absorbed in their devices seemed to have more negative or less engaged interactions with children,"" said lead author Dr. Jenny Radesky, who specializes in developmental behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. 

This is the first study to look at how adults are using mobile phones around children and how kids react to this use. The researchers wanted to describe parents' common patterns of mobile use as a first step toward understanding how this behavior affects parent-child interactions and child development, according to the study.

This is a tricky topic to study, Radesky said. ""Mobile device use is harder to measure than [use of] 'traditional media' like TV, because these devices can be used in so many different ways and are instantly accessible."" [9 Odd Ways Your Tech Devices May Injure You]

The findings were published online on March 10 and will appear in the April issue of the journal Pediatrics.

Observing behavior

Borrowing a technique from anthropology of observing people's behavior in real-life settings, the researchers wrote up 55 detailed observations of caregivers and children ages 10 and under eating in fast-food restaurants in Boston.

Neither the parents nor the children knew their behavior was being watched by a trained observer who was sitting at a nearby table taking detailed notes.

""This allowed us to record absolutely everything taking place during a family's meal -- the positive and the not-so-positive things — related to device use,"" Radesky told LiveScience.

These observations showed that 73 percent of adults in the study used a mobile device during their meal.

But the degree of use by caregivers varied, and five main usage patterns emerged from the findings: They included parents who never took the device out, those who placed it on the table but didn't use it, as well as adults who had brief periods of use, continuous use at the end of a meal, or near constant use throughout the meal.

The researchers also observed that children were almost always curious about what adults were doing on their devices.

Absorbed in technology

A large segment of caregivers in the study appeared to be more absorbed in their gadgets than their children.

Adults who were the most engrossed spent nearly the entire meal typing or swiping the screen rarely looking up to check on their kids or talk to them. Parents who talked on their phones typically had an eye on their child, the study found.

About 15 percent of caregivers took out their phones at the end of their meal — while children were still eating — and used it almost constantly from that point on, often because they seemed bored, the researchers noted.

The results suggest there may be healthier styles of device use, such as brief or occasional use or sharing the device with a child to look at a picture or video, that are more supportive of parent-child interactions, Radesky said.

But she also added, ""there may be reason for concern that a parent's excessive device use can lead to less positive and less sensitive interactions with children.""

The results are ""an initial descriptive look into a complicated topic,"" Radesky said. She offered these tips to parents to promote healthy family interactions:

4	"By Brad BrokerUsually, it’s the kid who gets in trouble for playing with their i-device at the dinner table.  But how about Mom and Dad?  How does smartphone use by parents affect interactions with their children?In a first-of-its-kind study published in Pediatrics, researchers analyzed how parents or other caregivers use mobile devices around children and how that use impacts relationships. “We chose to observe caregivers and children during meals because this is a daily routine in which face-to-face caregiver–child interactions are considered beneficial,” said the researchers from Boston University Medical Center.They observed 55 caregivers eating with at least one child in fast-food restaurants.  Forty of those caregivers used a mobile device during the meal.  Researchers were most concerned with the level of absorption, which they defined as the “extent to which the primary focus of the caregiver’s attention and engagement was with the device rather than the child.”Of the caregivers with smartphones, most of them used the devices throughout the meal and seemed to have more engagement with their phone than the child.  Researchers took notes during the observations.  Some of their comments included:A 2011 study published in Pediatrics advised physicians to tell their patients about the benefits of actively engaging their children during meals.  When parents and kids eat meals together at least three times per week, benefits “include a reduction in the odds for overweight, eating unhealthy foods, and disordered eating and an increase in the odds for eating healthy foods.”In the current study, it was common for children to act out to get the attention of the distracted parent and equally common for the parent to ignore the needs of the kids.  “Caregivers absorbed in devices frequently ignored the child’s behavior for a while and then reacted with a scolding tone of voice,” said the authors.Such inattention could lead to potentially dangerous situations.  “It may be that children can perceive the inattention and take more risk,” Dr. David Schwebel, a psychologist at the University of Alabama, told the Wall Street Journal during a previous study of texting and distracted parenting.One of the positive observations showed enjoyment by caregiver and child when they shared information or entertainment on the mobile device.  While no definitive conclusions were made from the observations, the researchers said that this analysis was “an important first step in the study of how device technology affects the daily interactions that are so important to child development.”September 19, 2017April 20, 2017March 15, 2016Your email address will not be published.

8	"A new study has revealed that use of mobile phones is distracting parents and caregivers, especially at mealtime.	Researchers analyzed 55 caregivers, usually a parent, in a Boston fast-food restaurant while they were eating with their children. They saw that 40 of the caregivers used their phones during their meal. Of them, 16 played with their phones throughout the meal, whereas three adults gave their phones to one of their younger dining companion, so as to ensure that they are occupied.	""When I talk about it with siblings or friends, everyone struggles with it. We want some guidance and balance. We need to stay connected with email, work and friends, and still be present with our kids"", said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a research fellow in developmental behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center and lead author of the recent study.	He said it has not been made clear by the study that what could be the possible risk with the mobile distractions. The study was aimed at getting a better understanding on how prevalent the phenomenon is.	It has been suggested by many of the studies that meal time has its own importance for healthy parent-child relationships. Children who eat regularly with their parents and have face to face conversation are likely to develop a better bonding with their parents and have less chances of becoming an alcoholic and drug addict.  	The latest study has suggested that if parents are distracted during the mealtime because of mobile phone use, then they would not be able to have face to face conversations with their children at an important time of the day.	The study author is of the belief that it is very important for children to have fact-to-face conversation with their parents as it results in better cognitive, language and emotional development. But the study has not made it clear what is the intensity of the impact on a child development because of use of smartphones by parents."	Health
9	"DETROIT (WWJ) – A new study suggests that smartphones are affecting parenting skills — and kids are beginning to take notice.Researchers from the Boston Medical Center observed more than 50 family groups eating out, and found that a significant number of adults were preoccupied with their smart phones.In the study, “Patterns of Mobile Device Use by Caregivers and Children During Meals in Fast Food Restaurants,” published in the April 2014 journal Pediatrics (published online March 10), found that smartphones are becoming more of a distraction when it comes to raising kids.They study found more than 70 percent of adults used their phone at least once, while about one-third used them continuously.Some kids accepted being ignored, while others acted out to get attention.The study author says face-to-face interactions are important for cognitive, language and emotional development, but they’re not sure how much impact parent smartphone use will have on a child development.The biggest concern is vocabulary development.Researchers say the best predictor of a child’s vocabulary is conversations between parent and child, often happening during meal time.Learn more about the research HEREPlease log in using one of these methods to post your comment: You are commenting using your Twitter account.

10	A new study has voiced concerns about what psychologists have long been touted as cell phone obsession. And this time, parents, not children, are being warned against excessive mobile phone use.The novel study by researchers from Boston University Medical Center warns that parents, who are glued to their cell phones, especially at mealtime, actually are missing out on important opportunities to communicate with their kids sitting right in front of them.“We know from decades of research that face-to-face interactions are important for cognitive, language, and emotional development,” said study lead author Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. “Before mobile devices existed, mealtime would’ve been a time where we would’ve seen those interactions.”Study detailFor the study, Radesky and colleagues camped out in Boston-area fast-food restaurants between July and August 2013, and watched 55 caregivers, usually a parent, as they sat down and ate a meal with one or more young children.They took detailed notes about the caregivers’ behaviors, describing all aspects of mobile phone use, and how children and caregivers reacted during these times.They found that 40 of the caregivers, mostly parents, used their cell phones or other handheld devices during the meal time, with 16 of them using it throughout the meal. They spotted 15 of the caregivers did not take their device out, while three handed the phone over to one of their younger kids to keep them occupied.The most engaged caregivers, the researchers noted, were swiping something with their fingers- perhaps surfing the web, reading or playing a game- compared to parents who just took phone calls.“All their attention, all their gaze was at the device,” Radesky told CBS News’ Jericka Duncan. “They rarely put it down to talk with other people within the group. They seemed to be more engaged in the device than with the children they cared for.”The excessive parental cell phone use affected caregivers’ as well as their children’s behavior. The researchers noted that the children behaved badly or exhibited weird behavior just to get their parents’ attention. And the parents who were more absorbed in their phones were more likely to respond harshly to their child’s bad behavior.“We did find it striking that during caregiver absorption with devices, some children appeared to accept the lack of engagement and entertained themselves, whereas others showed increasing bids for attention that were often answered with negative parent responses,” the researchers wrote in the March 10 issue of Pediatrics.The researchers also showed concerns that lack of face-to-face communication between caregivers and young kids may impact the children’s language development.

11	Thursday, Jan 25, 2018 | Last Update : 11:54 PM ISTWashington: A new study suggests that parents who are too busy on their smartphones, usually ignore their kids.Researchers from Boston Medical Center went undercover in 15 local fast food restaurants to observe nature's  parenting playground. They even observed the interactions between family members and noted down the reactions given out by children, when parents were continuously paying attention to their smartphones. Dr. Jenny S. Radesky, Developmental behavioral pediatrics expert at Boston Medical Center said that 40 out of 50 parents were engaged in their mobile devices. They seemed more distracted when they were typing and making swiping motions with the fingers, as compared to phone calls.Some children appeared unaffected and ate their meals in silence. Other children were more provocative, with one set of siblings singing Jingle bells or Batman smells to get their dad's attention.The degree to which the device was used, however, did not necessarily directly relate to the way in which the child reacted, according to the study.  	Health
12	"Some parents pay attention to their phones more than to their kids during meals, a Boston Medical Center study says.Researchers went undercover to 15 local fast-food restaurants to observe parent and child mealtime behavior. They realized that about 40 percent of those with mobile devices paid attention to the phone or tablet ""almost continuously"" throughout the meal rather than to their children.""If we're getting in the habit of always taking the devices out - a lull or a daily routine that's starting to be a bit boring - we can be missing quality interaction time with our kids,"" Dr. Jenny Radesky told Reuters Health.Of the 55 meals that were analyzed, 40 involved some mobile device. About 60 percent of the meals included a single adult and all meals were shared with one to three children. However, 16 of the adults used a mobile device throughout the meal, ""only putting it down briefly to engage in other activities,"" according to the researchers. Another eight adults became absorbed in their devices every now and then.There were 15 adults who didn't have their devices accessible, and three adults just left them on the table.The researchers write that face-to-face interactions with parents are crucial to the cognitive, language and emotional development of children.""When we eat, when we snuggle, when a parent puts a child to bed - these are important times when parent-child connectedness is important,"" Dr. Gene Beresin, executive director of the MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds, said according to ABC News. ""It sends a message to the child to pay attention to each other, to establish some intimacy.""Despite this evidence and advice, the moral of the story isn't to completely remove all mobile devices.""The conclusion I wouldn't draw from the study, is that we need to completely remove these devices when we are with our children,"" lead author Radesky said. ""But it does raise the issue that we need to create boundaries for these devices when we are with our children.""

13	Let’s admit it, we carry our phones, and sometimes even our tablets everywhere with us. They’re a huge convenience to us, we are able to stay connected to our friends and family members via social media, everywhere we go, we can surf the internet right from our phones, and carry an entire library’s worth of books in our purse. Technology is certainly a beautiful thing, and there is no doubting that it has made our lives easier. But are we spending too much time on our mobile devices?A new study released today in Pediatrics gives us a better idea of what kind of impact our mobile devices have on our closest relationships, especially the ones with our children. Researchers examined patterns of the use of mobile devices during meals in fast food restaurants. The study was designed by researchers from the Boston University Medical Center in order to generate a scientific hypotheses about mobile device use and the effects it has on caregiver-child relationships. As of right now, there has not been much research done on this topic.The team anonymously took to fast food restaurants to covertly observe a total of 55 interactions in a total of 15 neighborhoods within the Boston area. The majority of the groups they observed had between 1 and 3 children, of which most appeared to be school-age. The meal observation would last between 10 to 40 minutes. Over the course of the meal, the researchers would take detailed notes on the duration and frequency of use of a mobile device. They also monitored how many times the children would call for attention and how many times the caregiver would respond to the children. 15 of the 55 groups that were observed did not use any device during their mealtime, while the rest of the 40 groups’ usage ranged anywhere from brief interactions with their device to nearly continuous use throughout the entire meal, even eating and talking while staring at their device. Others would put the device down briefly to engage in other activities.But how did the children respond to their caregivers behavior? Some of the children were already engaged in conversation or activities with another child, or playing with a toy. Their behavior did not appear to be changed by their caregivers’ device usage, especially if the usage of the device was brief. However, when the caregivers were continuously absorbed in their device, some of the children did not bother to try and get the adult’s attention, while others began to show limit-testing and provocative behaviors, at which point the caregivers would use a scolding tone of voice with the child or seemed to be insensitive to the child’s needs. Some even used physical responses, like one caregiver even kicking the child under the table, and another repeatedly pushing the child’s hand away from their face when the child tried to lift their face away from the device. While most of the time these caregivers were physically near their children, they could not have been further apart, emotionally.It is clear that the impact of our mobile device use is effecting the relationships we keep, especially familial relationships. Overuse of mobile devices are sending a very grim message to children; that they are not worth their parent’s time, love or effort.Jenny Radesky, lead author of the study acknowledges that this topic is something that is “very complicated” to study, and that the research project is limited. Her intent in writing the study was to raise questions, rather than finding answers. Her goal was to “break the ice” on the subject and start the walk down the long road of fully researching this increasingly growing problem that affects more and more families every day.SOURCEJennifer is a stay-at-home mom who spends her days chasing around the never-ending ball of energy that is her son.

15	How to Live Better, LongerBehavior, Neuroscience & Your BrainTechnology & the Business of MedicineHealthcare, Policy & GovernanceBreaking News and TrendsScience is Stranger Than FictionCell phones have completely overrun our society. From higher rates of car crashes to apps for detecting eye diseases, they affect us both positively and negatively. Adding to the list of negatives, though, a new study finds that too many parents are using up valuable time at the dinner table on their phones, rather than communicating with their children sitting right in front of them.“We know from decades of research that face-t-face interactions are important for cognitive, language, and emotional development,” said study author Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, according to HealthDay. “Before mobile devices existed, mealtime would’ve been a time where we would’ve seen those interactions.”Studies have shown that kids learn best through live interactions with their parents and other adults. One study found that interaction, even through video chat applications like Skype, were better than educational videos at teaching kids language and its mechanics with regards to conversation. Another study found that fathers who interacted with their children more put them at a lesser risk of behavioral problems later on. Being on a cellphone takes away a lot from time that should be better spent, especially because children tend to have inquiring minds.For the study, researchers watched 55 random caregivers at fast food restaurants as they ate with one or more young children. They took notes about the caregivers’ behaviors, and found that 40 of the caregivers used their phones or other devices during the meal, with 16 of them using it throughout the entire meal. “The girl keeps eating, then gets up to cross the room to get more ketchup. Caregiver is not watching her do this; she is looking down at the phone…,” the notes said, according to NBC. “Still no conversation … Now girl’s head appears to be looking right at caregiver, and caregiver looks up but not at girl…”One child’s efforts to get his father’s attention led to being reprimanded for acting up — he was singing the parody of the song “Jingle Bells,” “Jingle bells, Batman smells.” Meanwhile some of those who “appeared to accept this lack of engagement … seemed like they’d given up,” Dr. Rahil Briggs, director of pediatric behavioral health services at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, told HealthDay.Although the effects of parental cell phone use on their children hasn’t been explored deeply, the looks that the researchers saw on the children’s faces showed that they were affected in some way. The study, however, didn’t look into how the children were treated once they got home, and children don’t always need constant face-to-face interaction, Gedeon Deák, a cognitive science professor at the University of California, San Diego told NBC. Nevertheless, it’s important for parents to find some kind of balance between cell phone use and spending time with their kids. Cell phones are “an essential tool,” Radesky said. “What we need to do is help build guidelines for the healthiest ways to use them. It’s important for parents to have ‘off’ time where they tune in only to their child.”Source: Radesky J, Kistin C, Zuckerman B, et al.

16	No doubt. People are addicted to their smartphones and parents are as guilty as anyone. You see them chatting on their cells while pushing their babies in strollers. You see them talking to their bosses on their headsets while playing in the sandbox with their kids at the park. You see them sending texts while chowing down on burgers and milk shakes with their children at fast-food joints. We’ve all assumed parents’ smartphone addictions can’t be good for children and now a new study confirms this to be true.The smart (Getty)A study published online today in the journal Pediatrics finds that smart phones are making us bad parents. This news isn’t surprising but might be hard to take for those moms and dads who are tethered to their cell phones and in the habit of constantly checking email.Researchers from the Boston Medical Center went undercover at 15 fast-food restaurants in the Boston area and surreptitiously observed 55 caregivers accompanied by one or more children. They took copious field notes and analyzed their findings to identify common trends around device use.Forty of the parents were on their smartphones at some point while dining with their children. About one-third were engaged with a device throughout the entire meal.Researchers noticed that parents who were tapping away on their phones tended to ignore their children or they reacted harshly to their kids’ behavior. Some children seemed unfazed by the lack of parental attention, while others were clearly bothered. The engagement between children and those parents who were glued to their phones was especially negative.In one situation, three boys loudly sang “Jingle Bells, Batman smells…” to get their father’s attention. In another, a mom never looked up from her phone while her daughter stole her brother’s chair and swung it around in the airA mother pushed away a young boy’s hand as he repeatedly tried to lift her face up from looking at a tablet screen. Another mom kicked her child’s foot under the table when he tried to divert her attention from her phone.Some parents calmed a rambunctious child with a digital device. A toddler who crawled under the table was drawn back to his seat with a tablet. In a few cases, the entire family was absorbed with their own gadget.Many studies have looked at the effects of unsafe smartphone use among drivers and pedestrians but few studies have analyzed the toll these devices have on parenting. Dr. Radesky, who is a fellow in developmental behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, thought these devices might be distracting parents from important face-to-face time with their children. She and her team devised a study that would look at families during a meal, a daily situation when parents and their children typically talk.Dr. Radesky hopes to use the study results to help the American Academy of Pediatrics develop guidelines for parents around smartphone use.“The conclusion I wouldn’t draw from the study, is that we need to completely remove these devices when we are with our children,” the study’s lead author Dr. Jenny Radesky told ABC News. “But it does raise the issue that we need to create boundaries for these devices when we are with our children.”[Time and ABC News]   	Health
17	"For once, it’s parents and not youngsters who are being told to get their noses out of their smartphones. The reason? Thumbing through one’s phone incessantly could damage the parent-child bond.A new study published in the journal Pediatrics found that adults absorbed in their mobile devices were more likely to harshly scold their children’s behavior.  Researchers from Boston Medical Center observed parents interacting with their children during meals in fast-food restaurants. They noted that one-third of the adults used their phones continuously during the meals, and 73 percent of them checked their devices at least once.When a parent who was glued to the phone was interrupted by a child, the parent was apt to react negatively, according to the study. One mother even kicked her child under the table after the child attempted to get her attention while she tapped away at her smartphone. Another mother ignored her child as he tried to lift her head from looking down at a tablet. Researchers believed the kids may have been acting out as a way to test limits or gain the parent’s attention.""What stood out was that in a subset of caregivers using the device almost through the entire meal, how negative their interactions could become with the kids,"" Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the center and lead author of the study, told Time. ""[There were] a lot of instances where there was very little interaction, harsh interaction or negative interaction between the adults and children.""She added: ""Caregivers who were highly absorbed in their devices seemed to have more negative or less engaged interactions with children.”Before we go pointing the finger at all parents who use their smartphones during meals, let’s keep in mind that most of us have trouble putting the mobile devices away. One British survey found that 66 percent of people are afraid to be separated from their cell phones. Another study by Time noted that 84 percent of respondents said they couldn’t go a single day without their cell phones, and 20 percent said they check their phone every 10 minutes. There’s even evidence that more and more people are using smartphones during sex.Still, researchers say their study of the effects of smartphone addiction on the parent-child dynamic is particularly important because it could have consequences for a child’s development.""We know from decades of research that face-to-face interactions are important for cognitive, language and emotional development,” Radesky told Health Day. “Before mobile devices existed, mealtime would've been a time where we would've seen those interactions.”Researchers say additional studies and further discussion about the use of technology around children are needed. Subscribe"	Health

20	" - You’ve seen it before: Parents using cell phones while their children vie for their attention. Now a new study suggests these behaviors can be seen often at mealtime -- an important time for child-caregiver interactions.			In the new study, published Monday in Pediatrics, researchers not only observed these behaviors, but extensively recorded and described aspects of caregiver cell phone use.Researchers observed 55 caregivers with young children at fast-food restaurants in the metropolitan Boston area. Out of the 55 observed, 40 caregivers (73%) used devices at some point during the meal. Nearly 30% used the device almost continuously throughout the meal, only briefly putting it down.“A lot of pediatric research literature showing that connections and interpersonal interactions during mealtimes are really beneficial to children’s health and development,” says lead author and pediatrician Dr. Jenny Radesky.The caregivers that were most absorbed in their cell phones, primarily focusing on the device rather than the child, were the ones continuously typing or making swiping finger motions on their devices. Phone calls seemed to be less absorbing, because parents often made eye contact with their children during the call and put the phones away after.“(Absorbed caregivers) seemed very irritated and flustered at trying to balance their attention between parenting and whatever they were doing on their device,” Radesky says. “Another major dynamic was that the child kept trying to make conversation and the caregiver would respond in a way that was delayed or didn’t seem attuned to what the child was saying.”Some children responded by “increasing bids for attention” while others would “accept the lack of engagement and entertain themselves,” the study showed.“If you are in a public place… your best chance of your child being well-behaved is for you to pay attention to them,” says Dr. Ari Brown, pediatrician and author of Baby 411.While cell phones often lead to “distracted parenting,” as Brown calls it, they can also create opportunities to share moments together, to be entertained together, and to learn together, she says. The study found that caregivers who used phones together with children were less focused on the device and more on the experience with the child.This is the first study to look at this topic and was not intended to draw any conclusions about how mobile device use affects relationships between caregivers and children.The authors hope to generate questions for future studies that dive into more specifics of caregiver cell phone use and care for their children. The long-term effects of such “present absence” should be considered moving forward.“When parents talk to their child less, their language development is affected,” Brown says. “Think long and hard about using For parents trying to manage their cell phone use and spend more time with their children, Rachel Stafford, New York Times best-selling author of Hands Free Mama, recommends starting small.“Create a daily ritual where time with your loved one is protected from all distractions and interruptions. That might be nightly tuck ins, breakfast time, or walking the dog,” Stafford says “You might have missed time with your loved ones, but there’s always today.”Article on CNN.com"	Health
21	NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Children trying to get their parents’ attention have some serious competition.You could call it “distracted parenting,” when mom and dad pay more attention to their smartphone than their kids, CBS 2’s Jericka Duncan reported Monday.Minde Christensen is a stay-at-home mom and admits her smartphone can be distracting.“As my kids are wandering around that I’ll often be checking Facebook or my email and there have been times that I haven’t known where my children are,” Christensen said.A new study in the journal Pediatrics took a look at the role smartphones play with parents and kids. Researchers observed 55 caregivers with young children at fast food restaurants and found that 40 of the caregivers used mobile devices during their meal – and 16 seemed completely absorbed.“They seemed to be more engaged with the device than with the children they were with,” said Dr. Jenny Radesky of Boston Medical Center.The children reacted two different ways — some accepted the behavior as normal, while others tried to get more attention.“They tried to start conversations. Maybe they acted more silly or acted out,” Dr. Radesky said.Radesky said when parents are on the phone, their children lose out.“Those moments of connection, or those face-to-face interactions, kids’ brains are wired to learn from those,” Radesky said.Christensen agreed, even though she said it’s easy to pull out her phone.“Sometimes I just have to put it away, put it in my pocket, push him on the swings and kind of really be engaged.

23	"By Brittany PattersonWe know Americans’ use of mobile gadgets has reached near ubiquitous status in our daily lives. Research shows our continued use has health effects on our skeletons, is changing they way we communicate, and even making walking less safe.But a new study published Monday in Pediatrics quantifies for the first time yet another side effect of our technological obsession: Many of us are engrossed with our devices even when eating with our children.Researchers anonymously watched 55 caregivers eating with one or more young children in fast food restaurants across different Boston neighborhoods and took copious notes. (They couldn’t call the caregivers “parents” because they were watching surreptitiously.) Researchers watched how often and for how long caregivers used devices during the meal — and if the children tried to get the caregiver’s attention. Their notes were independently analyzed and coded to identify common themes.Dr. Jenny Radesky led the team of researchers, from Boston Medical Center.“Like a lot of people I know, I was observing a lot of interesting behavior in public, parents using devices a lot and kids trying to get their attention,” Radesky said. “Their interactions were very fascinating to me.”The team found that 40 of the 55 interactions involved use of a mobile device and the interactions varied. Some caregivers  kept the device out, but on the table. Others spent the meal almost entirely engrossed in the screen. And there was everything in between. But overall the more engrossed the caregiver was with a device, the more likely he or she was to ignore the children. In some cases, researchers even observed parents getting physical with their little ones who vied for their attention. One adult woman kicked a child’s foot under the table and a second female caregiver pushed a young boy’s hands away when he repeatedly tried to lift her face up from her tablet.The more absorbed a caregiver was, the more likely they were not to react to their children’s questions, speak to their children, or make eye contact.Face-to-face interaction is often cited as an important component to child development because it is a foundation for learning language, learning how to regulate strong emotions, and developing empathy and social skills.Radesky, who is also a pediatrician and worked for a time in Seattle, one of the technology hubs of the United States, said she became increasingly concerned with the effects of technology on the development of these skills in children.“My concern is that it’s becoming such an obsessive habit that every time we have some downtime or a routine interaction we reach for our phones and we’re missing some fascinating interaction with our kids or maybe not even a fascinating one, but an interaction that their brains are wired to want from us,” she said.The children, researchers observed, reacted to their unresponsive parents in different ways, in some cases accepting the lack of engagement and entertaining themselves — or in other cases becoming more and more disruptive hoping to recapture their caregiver’s attention.As a parent herself with two young kids and a hyperactive email, Radesy said she is acutely aware that devices are woven into our daily lives. According to The Pew Research Internet Project, 91 percent of the American population owns a cell phone and nearly two-thirds of them use their device to go online.“It’s not the purpose of this study to say not to use devices around our kids, because there is some good to their use,” she said citing evidence that technology can be an effective tool for education. “But what is now perhaps becoming a cultural or family norm doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a good thing.Radesky said she hopes this study opens the door for continued research into the potential effects of device use and child development such as if device use relates to obesity.Kids sure love their microwave radiation!

Smartphones have been blamed for many things. Cancer, distracted driving, failing grades, lazy children, and now smartphones have gained the blame for “distracted parenting.”This study was published in the journal Pediatrics. Researchers from the Boston Medical Center conducted a study in which they followed families at 15 fast food restaurants, according to NewsDay. The researchers observed interactions and reactions from the children when their parents were paying attention to their phones. This study showed that 40 out of 55 families were completely absorbed in their smartphone while out at a family dinner. One third of the parents observed used their phones throughout the entire meal. The researchers noticed that while a parent was looking at their phone, the child was more likely to try and get their parent’s attention. This was done by making noise, even trying to lift their parent’s face from the tablet or smartphone. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, some parents even tried to calm their child by giving them a digital device. Researchers and experts say that parents should think of the information found in this study as a sign. The study’s lead author Dr. Jenny Radesky says that, “The conclusion I wouldn’t draw from the study, is that we need to completely remove these devices when we are with our children. But it does raise the issue that we need to create boundaries for these devices when we are with our children.”Comments are closed

27	"Parents pay more attention to their mobile devices than to their children during mealtimes, at least according to a new study from Boston Medical Center researchers.Researchers studied as small group of adults as they interacted with their young while eating at a fast food restaurant. Nearly half of the adults that had mobile devices, including cellphones or tablets, ""nearly continuously,"" paid more attention to the device than to the child eating.""If we're getting in the habit of always taking the devices out- a lull or a daily routine that's starting to be a bit boring- we can be missing quality interaction time with our kids,"" Dr. Jenny Radesky, the study's lead author, told Reuters.Radesky and her colleagues observed 55 caregivers that were eating with one or more young child at several Boston fast-food restaurants.""Forty caregivers used devices during their meal,"" the study authors wrote.""Absorption was conceptualized as the extent to which primary engagement was with the device, rather than the child"" and ""child response to caregiver use,"" the study authors wrote.Some of the kids tried to have fun by themselves, or misbehaved and tried to get the caregiver's attention. The caregiver would reprimand the child, then return to the mobile device.""Some caregivers weren't able to handle it and they lost their cool,"" Radesky told Reuters.The study was published in the journal Pediatrics.The goal was to find out how a caregiver's usage of a mobile device affects his or her relationship with the child, which has never been studied before, the researchers said.Mobile device usage is ""a ubiquitous part of American life,"" researchers wrote. By the end of this year alone, there will be more mobile devices than people on Earth, according to a mobile data forecast from Cisco.The potential danger lies in the loss of contact between caregiver and child. Radesky and her team wrote that a child's emotions, cognitive development and language skills grow with face-to-face interaction, Reuters reported.Radesky said the study was not meant to discourage caregivers from using devices.""As a mom what I take away from this study is- like any media behavior- that maybe this calls for a little bit of balance and how can I start to change some of my behaviors at home,"" Radesky told Reuters."

There were 55 interactions and each interaction involved a child under the age of 10.  They
 observed five different behaviours ranging from parents who didn’t use 
their phones at all during the meal, parents who put the phone on the 
table but didn’t use it, parents who used their phone intermittently,

However, this was not always the case and in some instances the children were able to amuse themselves  Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of the adults used their phone at least once during each meal. More than 15 per cent used their phones towards the end of the meal, while the children were still eating, and continued to use it until they left the restaurant. As well as playing up, a number of children became distracted when their parents were distracted and wanted to know why the parents were using their phones. The findings will be published in the April issue of the journal Pediatrics.This is the first study to examine how children behave when their adults are using their phones.  Previous studies have found that young children, especially newborns, use eye contact with their parents, in part, to form a bond and learn about the world. Language is also developed in a similar way. Limiting this face-to-face contact could cause problems with development and reduce the level of bond between a parent and a child - however, the researchers from Boston claim this study is just the beginning and more work needs to be done to make any conclusions about tech use in parents and child behaviour.

            By Amber SuttonThe study results, which were published in Pediatrics, showed that parents who used their smartphones during dinner were more likely to harshly reprimand their children for misbehavior.Researchers from Boston University Medical Center observed parents in fast food restaurants in July and August of last year to complete the survey. Overall, 55 interactions were recorded, 40 of which involved a parent or guardian on a smartphone, reports CBS News.USA Today reports as a parent became more absorbed in their device, researchers said they tended to respond harsher to a child's bad behavior, typically by responding in an escalating scolding tone.Of course, this is just a small look at the subject, and these results don't show a definite conclusion to how a parent's use of smartphone impacts a child's development, according to HealthDay.

As a parent, the widely accepted first rule to succeed is to show up, but new research suggests that continuous use of a smartphone in front of a child breaks that rule.According to LiveScience, researchers found that one in three parents stare at their smartphone while out to eat at a restaurant in the presence of their child. They have suggested that a child is more likely to misbehave when their parent is instead paying attention to their device.""Caregivers who were highly absorbed in their devices seemed to have more negative or less engaged interactions with children,"" said lead author Dr. Jenny Radesky, a pediatrics expert at Boston Medical Center, told LiveScience.Her team's research was published Monday and will appear in the April edition of the journal Pediatrics.With much attention being paid to smartphones and other advanced mobile devices falling into the hands of children younger and younger, this is a rare study that examines the same phenomenon in adults. The study's objective is to examine how technology and handheld devices affect parent-child interaction and child development.""Mobile device use is harder to measure than [use of] 'traditional media' like TV, because these devices can be used in so many different ways and are instantly accessible,"" Radesky said.The researchers chose dinner time as a study subject because it occurs regularly and encourages face-to-face interactions between parents and children, the Los Angeles Times reported.""We chose to observe caregivers and children during meals because this is a daily routine in which face-to-face caregiver-child interactions are considered beneficial,"" Radesky and her colleagues wrote. ""It has been estimated that 40% of American meals are eaten outside the home, so fast-food outings probably represent a substantial proportion of family meals.""Anita Kulick, President & CEO of Educating Communities for Parenting, wrote an op-ed for Philly.com that smartphones may be a godsend for adults with their plethora of capabilities, but are a major detriment to parenting. She argued that while an iPhone may be able to connect someone to someone else anywhere else in the world, it makes a parent mentally unavailable.For the study, the researchers examined 55 family interactions in 15 Boston-area neighborhoods in households with median incomes ranging from $45,000 to $110,000.While families varied in number of caregivers and number of children, only 15 of the 55 interactions did not involve a smartphone during dinner. Of the other 40, smartphone usage was as short as quickly reading a text to as long as continuous use for the duration of the meal.""When caregivers were continuously absorbed in the device, some children did not try to get the adult's attention, but many began to exhibit limit-testing or provocative behaviors. In this case, many caregivers used a scolding tone of voice, seemed insensitive to the child's expressed needs, or used physical responses,"" Kulick wrote. ""You don't have to be a child development expert or an anthropologist to see that this study exposes some serious issues concerning parents' overuse of mobile technology and its impact on their children. In some cases, parents were physically near their children, but emotionally miles apart.""Join the ConversationNov 28, 2017 PM ESTBerkeley College  named as the Military Times Best 2018 listNov 28, 2017 PM ESTPeking University ranks 14th as university with the best employment ability for graduatesNov 28, 2017 PM ESTTop 10 Best Colleges in the World Included many colleges and universities in CaliforniaJun 28, 2017 AM EDTNASA official says no alien has been found until today.Jun 28, 2017 AM EDTOver 2,000 computers in about a dozen countries were affected.Jun 28, 2017 AM EDTDo celebrities really affect marketing?Jun 26, 2017 AM EDTFor most students, going into the Top 10 schools is a dream come true.

40	"ÂŠ Goodshoot / ThinkstockMONDAY, March 10, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Mealtime is supposed to be  family time, but a new study suggests that ever-present smartphones are  impeding parent-child communication at the table.Researchers who observed more than 50 family-type groups eating out  found a significant number of adults were preoccupied with their  smartphones.""We know from decades of research that face-to-face interactions are  important for cognitive, language and emotional development. Before  mobile devices existed, mealtime would've been a time where we would've  seen those interactions,"" said study author Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow  in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. It's unclear how much of an impact parents' smartphone use will  ultimately have on a child's development, and whether that effect will  have a negative, positive or neutral impact, said the researchers.One basic thing that may be affected is child vocabulary, said Dr.  Rahil Briggs, director of pediatric behavioral health services at  Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. ""The single most powerful  predictor of a child's vocabulary is conversations with the child.  Dinnertime is an important time for those conversations, and if you're  absorbed with your phone, that's a lost opportunity.""Briggs added that social, emotional and conversational skills might  also be affected if parents spend too much time looking at their phones  and other media. ""What really concerned me was those children who appeared to accept  this lack of engagement. It seemed like they'd given up,"" noted Briggs,  who wasn't involved with the research. To capture a snapshot of how parents use their phones around their  children at mealtime, Radesky and her colleagues visited Boston-area  fast food restaurants and observed groups that included at least one  adult and one or more children who looked younger than 10. They took  detailed notes on how caregivers -- which likely included parents,  grandparents and babysitters -- used their smartphones and how children  responded. They conducted 55 observations last summer. Forty caregivers took out  their phones at some point during the meal. A few kept it on the table,  but didn't appear to use it. Another small group kept their phones in  their hands while doing other things. The largest group -- 16 caregivers -- seemed totally absorbed by  their phones, using them continuously, even eating and talking while  looking at the phone. In most cases, it appeared the caregivers were  using the phones' keyboards or making swiping motions on the phones  rather than making phone calls.Another nine caregivers used their devices intermittently, and then  put the phone away. The researchers said these caregivers appeared to  balance use of the device and paying attention to the child or children.While the adults used their phones, some school-aged children were  busy eating, talking to another child or playing with the toy that came  with their meal, and didn't seem concerned that the caregiver was on a  device, especially if it was for a short period of time. When caregivers were completely absorbed with their phones, some  children just seemed to accept it. However, many other children started  acting up in an attempt to garner the caregivers' attention.Some of these caregivers appeared to ignore the child's behavior for a  bit and then scolded them, sometimes without even looking up from the  phone.""Children are going to get X amount of your attention every day. Your  best bet is to give that attention in a positive way, or they may start  to seek it in a negative way,"" said Briggs.This is an emerging and important field of study, she added. ""We're  just learning how to think about exposure to media in small children,  and now parents are being distracted by their phones. We can't turn a  blind eye to this present absence,"" she said.Radesky and Briggs agreed that smartphone use isn't all bad. Sharing  apps and games with kids can be a way to connect. And smartphones  certainly won't be going away anytime soon.""They're an essential tool. What we need to do is help build  guidelines for the healthiest ways to use them,"" said Radesky. ""It's  important for parents to have 'off' time where they tune in only to  their child.""Briggs supports a balanced approach. ""My take on tech use for parents and children is everything in moderation,"" she said."	Health

Radesky, MD, of Boston Medical Center, and colleagues.""Although detailed analysis of interpersonal interactions was beyond the scope of this study, we did find it striking that during caregiver absorption with devices, some children appeared to accept the lack of engagement and entertained themselves, whereas others showed increasing bids for attention that were often answered with negative parent responses,"" they wrote in Pediatrics.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises physicians to discuss screen time, but that is usually in the context of the patient using the screen, pointed out Ari Brown, MD, a pediatrician at 411 Pediatrics in Austin, Texas. But the AAP policy statement on media use under age 2 does state that ""background media,"" or screen time intended for the parent and not the child, can also have detrimental effects on the child, she added.""The broader conversation should also go over the parent or caretaker's screen time,"" Brown told MedPage Today.""It's time for parents to be aware that their own screen use needs to be limited when their child is around. It only takes a minute with a caretaker's eyes and attention elsewhere for a little kid to get into trouble  --  [it's] a safety risk,"" Brown said. Radesky and colleagues spent time in fast-food restaurants in 15 neighborhoods in Boston during July and August 2013, and watched a total of 55 caregivers eat with children ranging in age from infants to elementary school age.""This method of direct, nonparticipant observation is common in the field of anthropology,"" Radesky's group wrote. ""The purpose of this approach is to identify cultural patterns and generate hypotheses for additional investigation.""Median incomes for the neighborhoods ranged from $45,604 to $108,686. Two caregivers were present for 41.8% of the observations, and the rest involved one caregiver. Almost half of the families had only one child present. About 44% of the caregivers were estimated to be in their 30s. The length of the meals observed ranged from 10 minutes to about 40 minutes.Of the 55 caregivers observed, 40 engaged with a mobile device during the meal. Radesky and colleagues defined ""absorption"" as ""primary focus of the caregiver's attention and engagement was with the device rather than the child."" The researchers calculated absorption based on frequency, duration, and modality of use, against attempts to get attention from a child, and the responses to those attempts from the caregiver.Continuous engagement with the device was observed in 16 caregivers, which included both sole caregivers and those with another adult present, men and women, and individuals of all age groups.Continuous use was typically in the form of typing or swiping the screen. Phone calls did constitute use, but caregivers were more likely to make eye contact with the child during a phone call than when they were engaged with the device screen.In the case of one absorbed caregiver, the child's bid for attention was met with a kick under the table. With another, the child was trying to pull the caregiver's face away from the screen, and the caregiver physically pushed the child's hands away from her face.""These findings warrant additional study but are an important first step in the study of how device technology affects the daily interactions that are so important to child development,"" the authors stated.Areas to explore include how caregivers conceptualize their mobile device use and the impact of ""present absence,"" or when a person is physically present but his or her thoughts are elsewhere, the group suggested.Brown noted that distracted parenting may be ""dangerous"" as distracted driving. ""When the caretaker has his or her eyes on a screen of any kind, there is less talk time and interaction, and over time, it can take a toll on fostering a child's development,"" she said.Although this study was in young children, Brown added that mobile device absorption by caregivers in front of teens is also a problem. ""Teens need attention from their parents as much as young children do ... it is hard to expect a teen to avoid texting and driving, or being addicted to their smartphone if they watch their parents doing these things. It is an implicit endorsement.""The study was funded by The Joel and Barbara Alpert Endowment for the Children of the City and Boston University School of Medicine.The authors reported no conflicts of interest.last updated 03.10.2014The material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider.© 2018 MedPage Today, LLC.

42	" Experience us with dark themeBoston Medical Center has conducted a study examining parents' mobile phone use while out at a restaurant eating with their children. The results suggest that the focus on cellular devices is inhibiting healthy family interactions with children.Known as the first study to analyze how adults use their mobile phones and how their children react to this use, lead author Dr. Jenny Radesky concluded that the children either acted out, accepted the lack of attention and conversation, or entertained themselves.There were five degrees of cell phone usage among the parents: those who never took the device out; those who placed it on the table but didn't use it; adults who had brief periods of use; continuous use at the end of a meal; and near constant use throughout the meal. About 73% of the adults in the study used their device at some point during the meal.The researchers examined the participants in real-life settings, observing parents and children 10 and under in fast-food restaurants. The participants did not know they were being watched, as an observer was taking notes nearby. A majority of the parents seemed to be more involved with their phones than their children, the researchers noted.""When we eat, when we snuggle, when a parent puts a child to bed - these are important times when parent-child connectedness is important,"" said Dr. Gene Beresin, the Executive Director of the MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds, in this ABC News article. ""It sends a message to the child to pay attention to each other, to establish some intimacy.""The use of mobile phones and other easily accessible technologies, such as iPads, can significantly affect healthy family relationships. These 'instantly accessible devices', as Dr. Radesky refers to them, are still difficult to measure usage of because they can be utilized in a variety of ways as opposed to say, television watching or radio listening.Dr. Radesky believes it is important for parents to engage with their children during such familial interactions. In this Live Science article she lists ways for parents to further engage with their children in order to properly manage their time if they have a busy life.TagsParents, Smartphone, technologyJoin the Conversation"	Health
43	"A latest study paper says mobile phones change the behavior and interaction between children and caregivers.For the study, the researchers secretly observed the caregivers and the children at fast-food restaurants.

The researchers noted down the frequent usage of phones by the parents, children's calls for attention and their parents' response.The study result showed that parents were mostly occupied with their mobile phones and some just responded to their children with eyes glued to their devices.""We chose to observe caregivers and children during meals because this is a daily routine in which face-to-face caregiver-child interactions are considered beneficial,"" wrote Dr. Jenny Radesky, a pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, reports The Los Angeles Times.""It has been estimated that 40% of American meals are eaten outside the home, so fast-food outings probably represent a substantial proportion of family meals,"" Radesky and her colleagues wrote.The researchers also found that the parents who were engrossed in their devices reacted harshly to their children's misbehavior.The children, on the other hand, ate their meals, talked to other children or played with toys and did not appear to change their behavior based on their parents' mobile phone use, especially if the use was for a brief time, reports Philly.com.The researchers found that the parents were mostly engaged in scrolling through information and not talking on the phone. They looked at their children even while attending calls.""Caregiver is looking at the phone, nodding a little while the child talks but not looking back at her or responding with words,"" one researcher wrote in their observation notes, reports the LA Times. ""Caregiver doesn't appear to be listening but says a few words in response every once in a while.""The researchers said that further study was required to elaborate the evidence as the current study was conducted on small number of people."

Many studies have tied smartphone use to sleeping problems, sleep deprivation and obesity. Now, in a new study, researchers are blaming smartphones for distracting parents from actual parenting at the dinner table.""We know from decades of research that face-to-face interactions are important for cognitive, language and emotional development. Before mobile devices existed, mealtime would've been a time where we would've seen those interactions,"" said study author Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center according to Philly.

For this study, the researchers examined a total of 55 groups of people who were eating at fast food restaurants throughout the Boston-area in Massachusetts. The groups were made up of at least one adult and at least one child who appeared to be younger than 10. The researchers observed the interaction between the adult and the child, including whenever the caregiver used a smartphone.Radesky's team found that 40 of the caregivers had taken their phone out at some time throughout the meal. A few of them had placed the phones on the tables but did not check them. Nine caregivers had checked their phones intermittingly. Another small group of caregivers held onto their phones while performing other tasks. The last group made up of 16 caregivers, however, used their phones constantly throughout the meal. These adults were focused on their devices while eating and talking.""What stood out was that in a subset of caregivers using the device almost through the entire meal, how negative their interactions could become with the kids,"" Radesky stated according to TIME.When the researchers analyzed the children, they found that many of the children of caregivers who rarely used their smartphones were able to entertain themselves. These kids were busy eating, playing with a toy or talking to another child or other children at their table. Children of caregivers who were absorbed in their phones, however, acted differently. The researchers noted that some of the kids appeared to act up in order to seek attention. These moments were initially ignored by the caregivers, followed by scolding in some of the cases.""Children are going to get X amount of your attention every day. Your best bet is to give that attention in a positive way, or they may start to seek it in a negative way,"" said Dr. Rahil Briggs, director of pediatric behavioral health services at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. ""We're just learning how to think about exposure to media in small children, and now parents are being distracted by their phones. We can't turn a blind eye to this present absence.""The researchers concluded that caregivers, regardless of their relationship to the child, should try to pay more attention to the child, especially during mealtime when meaningful conversations can occur. Radesky is currently working with the American Academy of Pediatrics to draft guidelines for parental smartphone use in front of children.The study was published in Pediatrics.Tagssmartphone, devices, Children, Conversation, Parenting, Technology, dinner, discussionsYou have already subscribed.

49	"Many people agree that focusing on a smartphone or tablet is a bad idea when you're supposed to be driving a car, but what about when you're parenting a child?As mobile devices become increasingly absorbing and pervasive, social commentators and researchers worry what effects they're having on interactions between children and distracted caregivers.In a paper published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, Boston researchers described what they called the first-ever investigation into the topic.They did so by secretly watching subjects at fast-food restaurants and recording their observations in notebooks or laptop computers outfitted with security screens so that their notes couldn't be seen.As it turns out, parents were so preoccupied with either their smartphones or their children that nobody caught on to what the researchers were doing.""We chose to observe caregivers and children during meals because this is a daily routine in which face-to-face caregiver-child interactions are considered beneficial,"" wrote Dr. Jenny Radesky, a pediatrician at Boston Medical Center.""It has been estimated that 40% of American meals are eaten outside the home, so fast-food outings probably represent a substantial proportion of family meals,"" Radesky and her colleagues wrote.Among other observations, researchers found that caregivers who were the most highly absorbed in their technology often responded harshly to child misbehavior.For example, one woman kicked a child's foot under the table, and another pushed a young boy's hands away when he was trying repeatedly to lift her face up from looking at a tablet screen.They found also that the highest level of caretaker absorption in an electronic device involved typing or scrolling through information, and not talking on the phone. When they were on the phone, they still made eye contact with their children.While some caregivers tried to use the devices to settle down unruly children, by playing a video for instance, others were so engrossed that they responded either angrily or robotically to their children.""Caregiver is looking at the phone, nodding a little while the child talks but not looking back at her or responding with words,"" one researcher wrote in their observation notes. ""Caregiver doesn't appear to be listening but says a few words in response every once in a while.""In another instance involving a father and his sons, a researcher wrote, ""Oldest boy starts singing ""jingle bells, Batman smells,"" and the others try to join but don't know the words ... Dad tells them to stop in a firm voice. Then he looks back to the phone ...""The researchers observed a total of 55 caregivers who were eating with one or more children. Of the caregivers observed, 40 used a mobile device at some point. All were observed in the Boston area.Radesky and her colleagues acknowledged that the sampling was small, but said it was intended to be the starting point for future, more elaborate studies. ""We did find it striking that during caregiver absorption with devices, some children appeared to accept the lack of engagement and entertained themselves, whereas others showed increasing bids for attention that were often answered with negative parent responses,"" the authors wrote.ALSO:Teenage pregnancy, birth, abortion rates all falling, report saysClimate change could worsen ozone levels across the U.S., study saysStudy examines achievement gap between Asian American, white students"	Health
50	"NBC -- The scenario plays out in restaurants everywhere: Mother or father looks at the smartphone or tablet, swiping, scrolling, reading, while son or daughter sits across the table. Or maybe a child's acting up, and instead of engaging, a parent hands over a tablet to distract the child with a game of Fruit Ninja.Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, and the mother of two small children, wanted to find out how common it is for parents to use mobile devices around their kids.""When I talk about it with siblings or friends, everyone struggles with it,"" Radesky said. ""We want some guidance and balance. We need to stay connected with email, work and friends, and still be present with our kids.""In a small pilot study released today in the journal Pediatrics, Radesky and her team report an answer: Distraction by device is very common indeed.The researchers surreptitiously watched 55 caregivers, usually a parent, eating and interacting with one or more children, from infants to 10-year-olds, in fast-food restaurants around the Boston area. Of the 55, 40 used a mobile device during the meal. Sixteen of these adults used the mobile device throughout the meal.Three adults gave a device to a child to keep the youngster occupied, but mostly the grown-ups were absorbed by screens. One adult with a little girl picked up her phone immediately upon sitting down and used it throughout the entire meal.""The girl keeps eating, then gets up to cross the room to get more ketchup. Caregiver is not watching her do this; she is looking down at the phone…,"" the field notes showed. ""Still no conversation … Now girl's head appears to be looking right at caregiver, and caregiver looks up but not at girl…""""We need to stay connected with email, work and friends, and still be present with our kids.""Some children responded with escalating bids for attention. ""Oldest boy starts singing ‘Jingle bells, Batman smells.'"" A father with his phone hushes him. ""The boys start singing ‘Jingle bells, Batman smells' again, and dad looks up and tells them to stop in a firm voice. Then he looks back to phone.""There has not yet been a comprehensive study on how parents' distraction by digital devices may impact children. But previous research has shown that even newborns are primed to gaze into a mother's eyes seeking social information. This is partly how bonds are formed. Very young children learn about their world largely through face-to-face interactions, vocalizations and touching with parents. They also develop language skills this way.Gedeon Deák, professor in the department of cognitive science at the University of California, San Diego, who studies human development and parent-child interaction, pointed out that children in many cultures grow up without constant face-to-face eye gazing and vocalization between parent and child, and yet ""they don't become sociopaths.""In extreme cases of neglect, with very little interaction between parents or other caregivers and peers, children can develop a variety of pathologies. But observing isolated caregiver-child interactions in a fast-food restaurant doesn't tell you very much about how they might interact at home, Deák said, and children don't need constant face-to-face time.On the other hand, he wondered how parent distraction and device interruption may affect the development of subtler skills in children, such as empathy and ability to read the vocal, eye and facial cues of others.""These are subtle aspects that are acquired late and slowly over years,"" he said. ""One question I have is how children understand the impact of these interruptions to look at a phone? How do they understand what it means for the conversation?""MIT professor Sherry Turkle, author of ""Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other,"" sees real danger. When she has observed families at home she sees that same kind of device distraction of parents as Radesky's team found.""I have quotes from college students depicting childhoods when they could not get parents' attention during meals,"" she told NBC News. ""What's troubling is that parents do not respond appropriately to children"" seeking attention ""and their own distraction from the children. That's the real story in this paper, the vicious little secret that starts the pathology we should worry about.""One thing that is clear, said Dr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York Presbyterian Hospital, is that eating meals with parents has been linked to a variety of benefits. Children who have regular sit-down meals with family are less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol or get pregnant as teenagers. They earn better grades. These benefits don't accrue just because parents and children are munching carrots at the same time; they happen because the family is communicating.Children who constantly see their parents playing with smartphones at the dinner table can feel neglected, insecure or not worth your time, Saltz said. ""You're going to miss a lot of those benefits of eating meals together.""While the science of device distraction may be just getting underway, Saltz is already convinced. ""Staring at your phone during a meal with your child is not a good thing.""On Thursday, Channel 3 learned that the Marion County Sheriff's Office vehicle stolen by Halfacre did not crash into a storefront.On Thursday, Channel 3 learned that the Marion County Sheriff's Office vehicle stolen by Halfacre did not crash into a storefront.Burger King's latest social experiment is showing the fast-food company is in full support of net neutrality.Burger King's latest social experiment is showing the fast-food company is in full support of net neutrality.Today a jury from Nashville will deliberate and possibly deliver a verdict in the trial of Benjamin Brewer.Today a jury from Nashville will deliberate and possibly deliver a verdict in the trial of Benjamin Brewer.A crash Thursday evening on SR-153 claimed the life of one of the vehicles' drivers.A crash Thursday evening on SR-153 claimed the life of one of the vehicles' drivers.Burnette called off search efforts for Dewayne Halfacre late Wednesday evening.

52	Last summer, CNN made media waves by running Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s one-hour documentary WEED, where he followed a child named Charlotte and her family on their quest to quell her seizures. Their journey brought them, and Dr. Gupta, to medical marijuana.It’s a journey Gupta continues to pursue, with his new documentary, WEED 2: Cannabis Madness.When the first WEED aired, Dr. Gupta apologized, sincerely repentant for having poo-pooed the medicinal benefits of cannabis.Today, he’s still apologetic. “You have to go for the truth,” Dr. Gupta tells The Daily Beast. “I made the mistake [of being anti-cannabis], and I was wrong.”And so WEED 2 continues his repentance, examining the science of the plant. This time he follows Vivian Wilson, a two-year-old girl suffering from 75 seizures a day, and her family’s struggle to find medical marijuana that eases them.It’s stories like Vivian’s that have inspired Dr. Gupta’s quest to discover the science behind the madness surrounding cannabis. “I am not backing down on medical marijuana,” he writes in a recent CNN op-ed. “I am doubling down.”A big part of WEED 2 is spent confronting the traditionally held anti-pot beliefs that he, as a doctor, used to have, and that are frequently brought up as the opposing viewpoint in media, such as marijuana’s impact on the developing brain, and the belief that marijuana can cause psychosis in young people.WEED 2 shows Vivian as she has a seizure, and is administered her traditional medication. She goes from bright and happy, to seizure, to zombie after the meds take effect. Existing epilepsy and seizure drugs, Dr. Gupta explains to The Daily Beast, have only been studied on adults and are used off-label on children. While some might argue that we don’t know the long-term effects of marijuana on a child, the same is true for the legal drugs we are already giving them for diseases like epilepsy.Gupta also says it’s “unclear” if marijuana causes the psychosis, or if, perhaps, young people already suffering from some sort of psychiatric problem are using marijuana to self-medicate. He stresses there needs to be more studies—but under U.S. law, he points out and examines in WEED 2, those studies are nearly impossible to conduct.The documentary explores disparities in U.S. government research on cannabis, and dives into revolutionary discoveries in other countries, including an exclusive look inside GW Pharmaceuticals, the UK company making cannabis into a prescription drug.Gupta compares the current reefer madness to the madness people had when transplanting organs was a new (and scary) medical practice. He tells The Daily Beast that people thought transplanting organs “was sacrilege.” The prohibition on cannabis and medical research seems to be the result of the same type of zealous fear. Cannabis prohibition, he says, “defies logic, from a scientific standpoint. There are other issues that drove [marijuana prohibition], but science was not one of them.”The Federal government treats cannabis as a “Schedule I” controlled substance—meaning it’s dangerous and has no medical use. Gupta points out that even methamphetamine and cocaine are recognized for their therapeutic value as “Schedule II” drugs.Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).“There is nothing accurate about the scheduling of marijuana,” he says.WEED 2 also moves full force into Colorado, where “cannabis refugees” are moving—not for themselves, but for their sick children. The doc shows dozens of families from Ohio, Alabama, and New Jersey who have made a huge life change, leaving friends and families behind, to seek out hope and healing for their children when Western medicine has fallen short.Gupta’s new doc shines a light on the Gordian knot of U.S. bureaucracy, pitting states against the Federal government, science against politics, and agency against agency.But what can be done in the interim, while the knot is being undone?Gupta is careful to stay away from lobbying and politics (though the first WEED has been quite influential in that regard), but he tells The Daily Beast that the Federal government could permit “compassionate care” to allow some of the obstacles to medical marijuana treatment “to be immediately broken down” so families wouldn’t have to uproot their lives by moving to Colorado to treat their sick kids.In addition, Gupta says there is much more research to be done. “You’d want this to go through a real process so you can understand what dose to take, and it’s treated like a real medicine.” Gupta said patients are resorting to trial and error, and they are forced to discover proper dosage on their own. Pause for a moment to consider having to figure out the correct dose of antibiotic or chemotherapy to take, on your own, for your child.If the documentary has one message, it’s that there is a science to the benefits of marijuana, and “It’s been there a long time,” says Gupta.When asked about medical marijuana prisoners, such as the case of patient Jerry Duval who is serving a 10-year sentence in Federal prison, Gupta responded: “When we take pride in the United States, it’s because things like that don’t happen in this country. But when someone is taking their medicine, recommended by a doctor, [and is incarcerated for it]… we have arrived at a place where politics trumps science, and that takes us back to the dark ages.”“It’s important to me that people understand how [cannabis] works,” he says of WEED 2. “I think most people will feel educated and smarter” after seeing it.WEED 2: Cannabis Madness: Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports premieres on CNN Tuesday, March 11 at 10 pm ET.

54	"Medical marijuana is not only doing well in public opinion surveys, but it could get an unexpected and unintended boost from its most high-profile opponent: Gov. Rick Scott.In an ironic twist, Scott's re-election campaign is set to spark such a mammoth TV ad war that it threatens to reduce the supply of available commercial advertising time, drive up the price of commercials and, therefore, make it tougher for outgunned antidrug crusaders to get out their message.""In an environment such as that, message-penetration can be challenging for anyone who doesn't have a lot of money,"" said Kyle Roberts, president of Virginia-based Smart Media Group, one of the nation's premier political ad-buying firms.The estimated $150 million that could be spent — $100 million from Scott and Republicans; $50 million from Democrat Charlie Crist — ""can cause a lot of voter confusion when it comes to other issues on the ballot,"" Roberts said.Medical marijuana is so popular in Florida that 78 percent of likely voters in Republican-controlled state Senate districts back the idea, according to a recent state GOP poll obtained by the Miami Herald.The survey echoes two others last month that found support for medical marijuana ranging from 64 percent to 70 percent — results consistent with every major Florida public poll released in the past year. Opponents of medical marijuana have one major advantage, however: It takes 60 percent voter approval — a high bar — to pass a constitutional amendment in Florida. So far, 20 states and Washington, D.C., have decriminalized marijuana, most for medical reasons.The Republican state Senate district poll, conducted last month by the Tarrance Group, found that 47 percent of likely voters favored outright legalization and 48 percent opposed legalization. And voters strongly backed lighter prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.In a nod to the popularity of the issue — and his own struggles in public opinion surveys — Scott hasn't crusaded against the proposed amendment. He said he's opposed to the medical marijuana initiative because he's against illegal drugs. However, he hasn't explained why he would oppose legalized marijuana if it's shown to have real medical benefits.Despite the trends in favor of marijuana decriminalization in one form or another, some surveys show, the argument that medical marijuana leads to complete legalization can be a potent tool to defeat the proposed amendment.But to get their message out effectively, opponents need to advertise on TV in Florida due to the state's large size and diverse media markets. And ads are expensive.It can cost a political candidate nearly $2 million a week to run enough statewide ads so that the average viewer sees them 10 times. For political committees, the cost of such a media buy can be about double what it costs candidates, who get the lowest-priced rates.Also, due to the broad array of TV choices and channels, voters are tougher to reach and persuade nowadays, requiring ever-more sophisticated efforts to identify the right way and time to reach them.Add it all together — the lack of ad time, the higher costs and the popular polling for medical-marijuana — and antidrug crusaders know they face a tough campaign.But they're still going to try, according to Lana Beck, spokeswoman with St. Petersburg-based Drug Free America Foundation Inc. and Save Our Society From Drugs, the lead organizations opposed to the amendment along with law-enforcement agencies.""We will be educating at the grass roots level,"" Beck said.John Morgan hopes the opposition stays that way.""If this is a word-of-mouth campaign, a grass roots effort, we win,"" said Morgan, an Orlando trial lawyer funding and leading the effort through his group People United for Medical Marijuana.Morgan has a secret weapon: the $20 million in TV ad time he reserves annually for his Morgan & Morgan firm, which employs Crist. Morgan said he's prepared to swap out some of his firm's air time for ads for medical marijuana should he need to. For years, the GOP-led Legislature has blocked and even refused to hear bills on the topic.But this year, Republican lawmakers have backed a bipartisan bill that would legalize a strain of marijuana for people with severe epilepsy. But it doesn't address other so-called debilitating ailments — such as cancer, AIDS or glaucoma — targeted by the constitutional amendment.The Senate poll indicated support for Charlotte's Web stood at 79 percent in favor, 18 percent opposed — mirroring support for the broader medical marijuana effort. Compared with a similar GOP Senate poll in April, support shifted a net 24 percentage points in favor of Charlotte's Web.Voters by 65-28 percent favored reducing prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and, by 78-15 percent, they supported prison diversion programs for those convicted of nonviolent crimes.Some Democrats, such as state Sen. Dwight Bullard of Miami, want to legalize marijuana outright, as Washington state and Colorado did.That bill has a slim chance of passing in the Legislature. Even Morgan, a Democrat, opposes the Democratic legalization effort because, he said, it could be used as a political weapon by opponents who say the medical marijuana amendment is a Trojan horse for recreational pot use."

55	"Going beyond the headlinesThe best advisors aren't brilliant; they're appropriateJoin the NASDAQ Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!
I'd like to preface this issue by saying today's essay might
  prove uncomfortable for some.
At StreetAuthority, our job is to present you with the very
  best investing opportunities. To ignore an opportunity just
  because it might be morally objectionable would be doing you --
  as well as the rest of our subscribers -- a grave injustice.
With those disclaimers in mind, today I want to tell you about
  the current investment opportunities in the United States'
  burgeoning marijuana industry.
As you may know, 20 states have already made cannabis legal
  for medicinal purposes, while several others have recently added
  a medical marijuana provision to their statewide ballots. Voters
  in both Colorado and Washington state have even gone so far as to
  legalize the drug for recreational use.
As a result, legal marijuana operations like Cannabis Science
  (
  CBIS

  ) -- a purveyor of some of the country's finest grown hemp (or so
  I've been told) -- have been popping up in ""green"" states all
  over the country.
These dispensaries -- or ""compassion clubs,"" as they're
  sometimes called -- have created a very interesting
  phenomenon...
That's because according to federal law, the possession and
  distribution of marijuana is still considered a crime. That means
  if the government wanted to, it could raid each and every one of
  these businesses, seize their assets, and haul the owners off to
  jail.
But they don't -- because, despite what many people think,
  U.S. officials aren't that stupid.
They've seen what happens when the government tries to force
  unwanted regulation down people's throats (think 1933 and the
  repeal of the Volstead Act, which ended Prohibition). That's why
  the feds have basically said they won't prosecute anyone who buys
  or sells marijuana in a state that has legally allowed it.
But make no mistake... this dichotomy won't last long. You
  can't have two legal codes -- which are supposed to operate in
  unison -- in direct conflict with each other. Something has to
  give.
As a result, right now Colorado (and soon Washington) is
  serving as one giant experiment for the full-scale legalization
  of marijuana in the U.S.
That is, Colorado and Washington will show us whether
  marijuana -- with all its surrounding controversy -- can be
  legally consumed without invoking public outcry, or if we need to
  put an end to the legalization talk once and for all.
Our guess is that the former scenario will likely play out.
  Here's why...
As recently as the 1980s, public opposition to marijuana was
  as high as 80%. Anti-pot movies like the 1936 film ""Reefer
  Madness"" led children and young adults to believe the use of
  marijuana would result in a life of social deviance (the film
  showed regular marijuana users committing suicide, conducting
  hit-and-run ""accidents"" as well as performing other clandestine
  activities).
In the past few years, we've seen that opinion begin to
  reverse. While there are a host of explanations for this (like
  new studies showing that consuming cannabis can cause pain relief
  in chronic illnesses like cancer, and the maturation of the baby
  boomers and younger generations, who generally tend to have more
  accepting views of the drug than their parents, to name a few),
  the important thing here is that America's perception of the
  plant is changing, and quickly...
According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, 52% of
  Americans are now on board with legalizing marijuana. As today's
  younger generation matures, that number is likely to climb.
Again, at this point I'd like to reiterate that whether you're
  one of the 52% who agrees with legalization -- or part of the 48%
  who oppose it -- is irrelevant. We certainly understand if you
  don't want to participate in the marijuana trade, but to ignore
  the legalization story is to deny the fact that right now, the
  marijuana market could be setting up one of the biggest
  investment opportunities of the next few years.
If legalized, pharmaceutical companies... tobacco companies...
  even some alcohol companies are going to want a piece of this
  relatively unexplored market. When that happens, there will be a
  massive scramble to acquire companies with established marijuana
  operations -- especially those that have already proven to be
  profitable.
Andy Obermueller, Chief Investment Strategist for
  
Game-Changing Stocks


  , talks about this opportunity in the February 11 issue of his
  premium newsletter:

The State of Legal Marijuana Markets report, released in
    early January by ArcView Market Research, estimates legal
    cannabis hit $1.43 billion in sales in 2013 and that it will
    grow 64% to $2.34 billion in 2014.
To put that in context, that's a rate of growth faster than
    smartphones achieved. ArcView said more than 590,000 Americans
    will have bought pot legally from a retail storefront by the
    end of this year.
That is just the beginning.
The illegal drug business is worth an estimated $400 billion
    a year in the United States alone. Marijuana offenses account
    for 48.3% of all drug arrests, according to an analysis of FBI
    data published in U.S. News & World Report. So presuming
    all marijuana sales become legal in the next 20 years, you can
    see the incredible growth potential -- some 30% a year in
    compound annual growth.

To take advantage, Andy recommends buying stock in the
  companies selling the technology needed to make large-scale
  commercial marijuana production a reality. As he goes on to
  say...

The fact is, pot is easy to grow. It grows in the wild all
    over the United States. Proper cultivation is the game-changer:
    Add good light, plentiful water and good plant nutrition, and
    serious growers can produce a massive quantity in very little
    space. Ultimately, this is not an agricultural problem but a
    security question: How does a grower secure millions of
    dollars' worth of grass in a field somewhere? The likely answer
    is to grow the plant indoors, under secure and carefully
    controlled conditions.
The companies that are able to establish themselves as the
    leading providers of premium-quality marijuana and derivative
    products will be wildly successful as more state legislatures
    give grass the nod.

Of course, we understand if you have reservations about
  directly investing in marijuana producers. After all, these are
  still relatively unproven businesses in a relatively unknown
  market. While there will undoubtedly be some big winners in this
  space, there's also going to be a lot of losers as the industry
  grows and consolidates.
But that said, we think it's foolish to overlook the
  investment opportunity in the marijuana industry. Whether we like
  it or not, ""reefer madness"" could be here to stay.

I'd like to preface this issue by saying today's essay might
  prove uncomfortable for some.At StreetAuthority, our job is to present you with the very
  best investing opportunities. To ignore an opportunity just
  because it might be morally objectionable would be doing you --
  as well as the rest of our subscribers -- a grave injustice.With those disclaimers in mind, today I want to tell you about
  the current investment opportunities in the United States'
  burgeoning marijuana industry.As you may know, 20 states have already made cannabis legal
  for medicinal purposes, while several others have recently added
  a medical marijuana provision to their statewide ballots. Voters
  in both Colorado and Washington state have even gone so far as to
  legalize the drug for recreational use.As a result, legal marijuana operations like Cannabis Science
  (
  CBIS

  ) -- a purveyor of some of the country's finest grown hemp (or so
  I've been told) -- have been popping up in ""green"" states all
  over the country.These dispensaries -- or ""compassion clubs,"" as they're
  sometimes called -- have created a very interesting
  phenomenon...That's because according to federal law, the possession and
  distribution of marijuana is still considered a crime. That means
  if the government wanted to, it could raid each and every one of
  these businesses, seize their assets, and haul the owners off to
  jail.But they don't -- because, despite what many people think,
  U.S. officials aren't that stupid.They've seen what happens when the government tries to force
  unwanted regulation down people's throats (think 1933 and the
  repeal of the Volstead Act, which ended Prohibition). That's why
  the feds have basically said they won't prosecute anyone who buys
  or sells marijuana in a state that has legally allowed it.But make no mistake... this dichotomy won't last long. You
  can't have two legal codes -- which are supposed to operate in
  unison -- in direct conflict with each other. Something has to
  give.As a result, right now Colorado (and soon Washington) is
  serving as one giant experiment for the full-scale legalization
  of marijuana in the U.S.That is, Colorado and Washington will show us whether
  marijuana -- with all its surrounding controversy -- can be
  legally consumed without invoking public outcry, or if we need to
  put an end to the legalization talk once and for all.Our guess is that the former scenario will likely play out.

60	MJNA has kept its usual steady stream of press releases coming, with no earthshaking announcements in it, mostly informing about activities and sponsorships conducted through HempMedsPX, MJNA and CannaVest's marketing and distribution company. The excitement surrounding marijuana stocks has definitely not died down, seeing how the majority of the popular tickers are still heavily traded. It's just that the wild price swings from the first days of 2014 have come to an end and prices are mostly moving without any major hiccups.MJNA supporters are excited about a recent piece of media coverage delivered by Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, who said he was not backing down but instead 'doubling down' on medical marijuana for legitimate patients. A full documentary by Dr. Gupta will air tomorrow and it remains to be seen whether this will affect MJNA's stock.MJNA longs seem to expect that Dr. Gupta will put the spotlight on MJNA and highlight it in his coverage. This is not too likely considering his original short piece actually highlights another company based in the UK - GW Pharmaceuticals - a NASDAQ-listed entity who is also focused on CBD-rich medicinal products and is pushing for prescription drugs produced from the marijuana plant.MJNA is currently trading over the $0.30 mark, steady into the early session, 3% in the green.Type the characters that you see in the box (5 characters).

CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says for many patients there's another good yet equally controversial option: medical marijuana.Dr. Gupta told Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" Monday: ""Ninety-four percent of the studies in this country that I reviewed looked specifically for harm, not for benefit. So you get a distorted picture and that's part of the problem, but I think that starts to have an impact on the way people actually think about this substance as well. Very different than in other countries.

Lola / CNN VCMRemember when they use to call the pills ""Tranquillizers""? Basically it's the same dope the Dr. writes that prescription for.

The government has no right to tell you what you can raise or grow in your back yard. Want chickens, you better check with your local and state laws 1st or they can and will drop in on you, arrest you, fine you and take away your chickens, and as for Roosters, don't go there. Just keep thinking, the government is smarter and wiser than me, the government is smarter and wiser than me. Now your getting the picture.Last year the NIDA authorized a KY based pharmaceutical company to produce a hash oil tincture skin patch to be tested as a ""withdrawel"" treatment for alcoholics and opiate addicts.

Cathy Klein is a Jacksonville mom who says having access to medical marijuana for her son who has uncontrollable seizures is a no-brainer for her.
""I have a nine-year-old son with epilepsy and no matter where we go or what we do, we haven't been able to control his seizures.""


She says she hopes a recent bill filed by a South Florida senator to legalize the recreational use of marijuana won't distract from a constitional amendment on the November ballot. which only seeks to legalize marijuana for medical conditions.

""There are people who are confusing this with recreational use, and time and time again I've said no this is strictly medical.""

67	"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that it had approved a nerve-stimulating device to prevent migraines that is worn as a band across the forehead.WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that it had approved a nerve-stimulating device to prevent migraines that is worn as a band across the forehead. The battery-powered device, to be positioned above the eyes, sends an electric current to the skin and underlying tissue via a self-adhesive electrode to stimulate the trigeminal nerve that is associated with migraines. Manufactured by Belgium-based CEFALY Technology SPRL, the prescription-only device is intended for use once a day for 20 minutes. The FDA said it was the first medical device to be approved as a preventive treatment for the severe headaches. “This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks,” said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. About 10 percent of people worldwide suffer from migraines, according to the National Institutes of Health. Characterized by intense pain in one area of the head accompanied by nausea or vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound, a migraine can last from 4 to 72 hours if untreated. Drugs to treat migraines called triptans, which include generic forms of GlaxoSmithKline’s Imitrex, have cardiovascular side effects that make them inappropriate for many patients. The CEFALY device is for patients 18 or older. The FDA said in a clinical study of 67 patients in Belgium that those who used the device had significantly fewer migraines per month and used less medication than those who used a placebo device. The device did not reduce the intensity of migraines that occurred.WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that it had approved a nerve-stimulating device to prevent migraines that is worn as a band across the forehead.The battery-powered device, to be positioned above the eyes, sends an electric current to the skin and underlying tissue via a self-adhesive electrode to stimulate the trigeminal nerve that is associated with migraines.Manufactured by Belgium-based CEFALY Technology SPRL, the prescription-only device is intended for use once a day for 20 minutes.The FDA said it was the first medical device to be approved as a preventive treatment for the severe headaches.“This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks,” said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.About 10 percent of people worldwide suffer from migraines, according to the National Institutes of Health.

forehead. The user attaches it with a self-adhesive electrode, just above the eyes. The device 

delivers a low electric current through the skin and may cause a tingling or massaging 

sensation. The current stimulates the trigeminal nerve, which has been associated with migraine 

headaches.The device, which is manufactured by STX-Med in Herstal, Liege, Belgium, and available on 

prescription for patients aged 18 and over, should only be used once a day for 20 minutes, says 

the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).According to the National Institutes of Health, migraine headaches affect about 10% of people 

worldwide and are more common in women than men. The debilitating pain, which can last from 4 up 

to 72 hours, is felt as intense throbbing in one part of the head and is often accompanied by 

nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA's Center for Devices 

and Radiological Health, says:""Cefaly provides an alternative to medication for migraine prevention. This may help patients 

who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating 

attacks.""The FDA reviewed a study conducted in Belgium involving 67 people of who were having at least 

two migraine attacks a month and who ceased taking migraine medication for the 3 months 

leading up to the start of the trial.The results showed that compared with patients using a dummy device, those using Cefaly 

reported significantly fewer days per month with migraine headaches and using less medication. 

However, Cefaly did not completely prevent migraine attacks and did not reduce their intensity 

when they occurred.The FDA also reviewed a patient satisfaction survey of 2,313 Cefaly users in France and 

Belgium that found 53% were satisfied with the treatment and would buy it for further use.No serious adverse effects were reported by users in either study. The most common complaints 

that arose in the user survey included not liking the sensation of the treatment, not wanting to 

continue using it, feeling sleepy during treatment and having a headache afterwards.In December 2013, the FDA approved the first medical device for the 

treatment of migraine headaches preceded with aura. The Cerena Transcranial Magnetic 

Stimulator, which is also available on prescription only, is used after the pain of migraine preceded 

with aura has started.

71	" Experience us with dark themeThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of a Belgium-made medical device to prevent migraine headaches, earlier this week.The first medical device 'Cefaly' manufactured by STX-Med, Belgium, is similar to a plastic headband that is meant to be worn across the forehead and on the ears. This device is the first transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device (TENS) that is mainly authorized for use before migraine attacks.""Cefaly provides an alternative to medication for migraine prevention,"" said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a news release.  ""This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks.""The prescribed product is defined as a small, portable, battery-powered device that is recommended for patients above 18 years of age and older. The device is meant to be positioned at the center of the forehead with the help of a self adhesive electrode and should be used for just 20 minutes a day.On using the device, a small dose of electric current is applied to the skin and the underlying body tissue to stimulate the branches of the trigeminal nerve that is linked to migraine attacks. The agency cautions that the user may experience a slight tingling or massaging sensation.The federal agency examined the product through the premarket review pathway.  To test the safety and effectiveness of the device, they examined the data of a clinical study that was conducted on 67 people from Belgium. These individuals experienced more than two migraine headache attacks in a month and had not been treated three months before the use of Cefaly. They also examined the data of a patient satisfaction study that was done on 2,313 Cefaly users in France and Belgium.The first study on 67 individuals revealed that those who used Cefaly experienced fewer days with migraines per months and also used less medication to prevent the attacks. The device not only helped prevent migraine, but also lowered the intensity of migraine whenever it occurred.The other patient satisfaction study showed that the 53 percent of the users continued to use the device as they were satisfied with the treatment. The participants reported feeling a bit drowsy during the treatment session and experienced headaches after the treatment session.  Other than that, there were no adverse side effects.According to the statistics of the National Institutes of Health, migraine headache affects nearly 10 percent of the population worldwide and is three times more prevalent in females than males. Migraine headache is defined as an intense pulsating pain in a certain area of the head and generally causing nausea, vomiting or extreme sensitivity to light and sound. A migraine attack is known to last between four and 72 hours, if left untreated.          )TagsFDA, Migraine, Headache, CefalyJoin the Conversation"	Health

Cefaly is currently recommended for people of age 18 or above. The device should be used only once per day for 20 minutes, FDA said in a statement. Cefaly is manufactured by STX-Med in Herstal, Liege, Belgium.Safety and efficacy for the device was evaluated via a study conducted on 67 people living in Belgium. The participants had two migraine attacks a month and weren't on any medications to prevent headaches. Researchers also looked at data from 2,313 Cefaly users in France and Belgium to assess patient satisfaction.Data from the patient satisfaction study showed that over half (53 percent) of the participants were satisfied with the treatment and were willing to buy the device. Common problems of using the device were sleepiness during treatment and headache after treatment session.Cefaly is also the first transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device, which can be used before the migraine attack. Join the ConversationYou have already subscribed.

74	The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday approved the first medical device for preventing migraine headaches. The device, called Cefaly, works by stimulating nerves beneath the forehead that trigger migraine headaches.Made by a Belgian company, Cephaly Technology, Cefaly is a small, portable and battery powered nerve-stimulating device that looks like a plastic headband.Just like a tiara, this prescription device is worn across the forehead and atop the ears. Cefaly is positioned in the center of the forehead with a self-adhesive electrode. This small electrode applies an electric current to stimulate the migraine-inducing trigeminal nerve.The device uses the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) technology to emit an electric impulse that is transmitted to the skin and underlying body tissues to stimulate branches of the trigeminal nerve. The technology triggers the pain center of the brain evoking it to produce more endorphins to relieve the migraine.“Cefaly provides an alternative to medication for migraine prevention,” said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks.”The FDA’s approval for the device is based on a study of 67 people in Belgium and a patient satisfaction study of 2,313 Cefaly users in France and Belgium.  The 67-person study showed that those who previously suffered more than two migraine attacks a month reported significantly fewer days with migraines per month after using Cefaly compared to those who used a placebo. These patients also reported a reduced need for migraine medication compared to placebo group.In the 2,313- migraine patients study, about 53 percent of the patients said they were satisfied with the Cefaly headband and wanted to purchase it for future use.However no serious adverse events took place during either study, some participants reported sleepiness while wearing the device and migraine pain and headaches after the treatment session.The FDA, an American health watchdog within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has indicated Cefaly for patients aged 18 years and older and to be used not more than for 20 minutes once a day.

NEW YORK – It’s time to suit up: Men’s Wearhouse is buying Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion. Men’s Wearhouse Inc. will pay $65 per share, a 5 percent premium to Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc.’s closing price Monday of $61.83. The agreement ends a monthslong back-and-forth that began in October when Jos. A. Bank offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion. Men’s Wearhouse scoffed at that offer and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion. By early March, Men’s Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 per share if some conditions were met. The combined company will be the fourth-biggest U.S. men’s clothing retailer with more than 1,700 U.S. stores and about $3.5 billion in sales. The transaction is expected to close by the third quarter.  WASHINGTON – The chairman of the nation’s transportation accident investigations board is leaving to become the president and CEO of the National Safety Council. Deborah Hersman said in a blog Tuesday that her nearly 10 years at the National Transportation Safety Board have been “a great ride,” but she is moving on to the second “dream job” of her career. The 43-year-old Hersman was on-scene for more than 20 accident investigations, including the crash of an Asiana Airlines jet in San Francisco last July. She is particularly known for championing protections for children, including on planes. Hersman said she came to Washington two decades ago believing “government can do important work on behalf of the citizens of this great country.”  DETROIT – A person briefed on the matter says the Justice Department is investigating whether General Motors broke any laws with its slow response to a deadly problem with ignition switches on certain small cars. The probe is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation is not public. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately return calls. GM would not comment. GM already is facing investigations by Senate and House committees and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Last month GM announced the recall of 1.6 million older compact cars worldwide to replace ignition switches that can shut off the motor unexpectedly. GM says the problem is linked to 13 deaths.

76	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given green signal to marketing of first transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device as a preventative treatment for migraine headaches. The Cefaly Anti-migraine Device, manufactured by STX-Med in Herstal, Liege, Belgium, is the first device that has received marketing approval for treating migraine headaches. The device is small, portable, battery-powered and fitted with self-adhesive electrode which provides low intensity electric current to patients, underlying body tissues to stimulate branches of the trigeminal nerve associated with migraine headaches. This CE-marked and ISO certified medical device allows the brain to produce more endorphins to relieve the migraine by stimulating the pain center of the brain. The device is recommended only for people above 18 years of age and should be used once a day for not more than 20 minutes. The first TENS technology based device is already being marketed in Europe for 295 Euros and in Canada for $300. Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said that the device will help those patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing their disease. The National Institutes of Health has revealed that about 10% of people are suffering with migraine across the world with three times higher rate among women compared to men.After conducting study on 67 volunteers, who experienced migraine attacks for more than twice a month, researchers ensured safety and effectiveness of the device. They found 53% of patients were satisfied who underwent treatment with the Cefaly device compared to patients with placebo device.Intense pain in one portion of head with nausea or vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound are symptoms of migraine which can lasts for four to 72 hours if left untreated.

""This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks.""Approval for marketing of the device was given after the FDA reviewed the device through the de novo premarket review method. The review pathway is generally used to analyze low to moderate-risk medical devices that are not substantially equivalent to an already legally marketed device.Data from a clinical study conducted in Belgium involving 67 individuals was used to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device. All the individuals in the study experienced more than two migraine headache attacks a month and had not taken any medications to prevent migraines for three months prior to using Cefaly.Researchers found that the individuals who used Cefaly experienced significantly fewer days with migraines per month and used less migraine attack medication than those who used a placebo device. The device did not completely prevent migraines and did not reduce the intensity of migraines that did occur.Another study was conducted on 2,313 Cefaly users in France and Belgium top evaluate patient satisfaction among the device users. The FDA found that more than 53 percent of patients were satisfied with Cefaly treatment. They were also willing to purchase the device for daily usage.Some of the complaints received from Cefaly users included awkward feeling while using the device, sleepiness during the treatment session, and headache after the treatment session.The device is a small, portable, battery-powered, prescription that resembles a plastic headband worn across the forehead and atop the ears. It needs to be placed at the center of the forehead, just above the eyes. Cefaly then applied an electric current to the skin to stimulate branches of the trigeminal nerve.The FDA warned that users may feel a tingling or massaging sensation where the electrode is applied. Cefaly is recommended for patients 18 years of age and older and should only be used once each day for 20 minutes.Statistics show that more than 37 million Americans suffer from migraines. Some migraine studies estimate that 13 percent of adults in the U.S. population have migraines, and 2-3 million migraine suffers are chronic. Almost 5 million in the U.S. experience at least one migraine attack per month, while more than 11 million people blame migraines for causing moderate to severe disability.)"	Health

General Surgery News ReportGuidelines Extend Thrombectomy Window to 24 HoursDoc-to-Doc: Bringing 'Medicine The Musical' to the New York StageA headband delivering electrical nerve stimulation can prevent onset of migraine headaches and can be marketed for that purpose in the U.S., the FDA said Tuesday.Called Cefaly, the Belgian-made device is the first to win FDA approval for migraine prevention and is also the first transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) system OK'd for any type of pain prevention, as opposed to acute treatment, the agency said.The device is battery-powered and worn around the head, with the actual TENS stimulator centered on the forehead just above the eyes. It delivers a small, steady current to trigeminal nerve branches. Patients will be instructed to use the device once daily for a maximum of 20 minutes. It is approved for adults only.Approval was based primarily on the PREMICE trial, in which 67 adult patients were randomized to wear either the Cefaly device or a nonfunctional sham. When turned on, the device typically causes a tingling sensation, but the trial investigators sought to maintain blinding by not asking participants what it felt like and by trying to keep them from talking with each other.Patients assigned to the real device showed a decline from baseline of about two headache days per month, compared with no change in the control group. A responder analysis showed that 38% of patients receiving stimulation had at least a 50% reduction in monthly headache days, compared with 12% of the control group.The Cefaly device was previously approved in Europe and Canada. The device's manufacturer, STX-Med of Herstal, Belgium, submitted results of a patient satisfaction survey conducted among more than 2,000 users in Europe, indicating that most regular users believed they had experienced ""very significant improvement"" and only 4% reported adverse effects.Across the entire respondent group, including those who only used the device infrequently or not at all, 54% reported substantial improvement.Complaints about the device included dislike of the tingling sensation, sleepiness during the treatment sessions, and headache following the sessions, the FDA said. None of the reported adverse effects were considered serious.Numerous TENS devices are already marketed for pain treatment.last updated 03.11.2014The material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider.© 2018 MedPage Today, LLC.

86	"The Food and Drug Administration has approved the marketing of the first neurostimulation device to prevent migraine headaches.Image courtesy of STX-MedThe Cefaly stimulator, which looks like a space age tiara, is a battery-powered device worn over the forehead like a headband. It delivers transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation through an electrode to the nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve, which has been associated with migraine headaches.Users may feel a tingling or massaging sensation where the electrode is applied.A recent study on 67 migraine patients found that wearing the Cefaly device for 20 minutes a day reduced the number of migraines just as effectively as migraine drugs or other types of migraine therapy. The patients’ use of migraine drugs also declined significantly.“Cefaly provides an alternative to medication for migraine prevention,” said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.“This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks.”The FDA cautioned the device does not completely prevent migraines and does not reduce their intensity.“The use of the Cefaly device as preventive therapy for migraine is based on a small but reasonably designed clinical trial performed by widely respected investigators in Belgium. The trial showed benefits that were comparable to those of other migraine preventive therapies — that is to say statistically significant but not spectacular reduction in the frequency of migraine days,” said Andrew Charles, MD, who runs the Headache Research and Treatment Programs at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine.“Early experience of our patients who obtained these devices from Canada indicates that the stimulation may be uncomfortable, but otherwise there do not seem to be any serious adverse effects,” Charles said in an email to National Pain Report.“My overall impression is that it is an approach that is worthy of further study. I can’t enthusiastically recommend it to patients at this time because of the limited evidence, the cost, and the time commitment required. On the other hand, if patients want to try it despite these caveats, I tell them to go ahead.”About 31 million adult Americans suffer from migraine. It affects three times as many women as men. In addition to headache pain and nausea, migraine can also cause vomiting, blurriness or visual disturbances, and sensitivity to light and sound.The Cefaly stimulator is made by the STX-Med company in Belgium. The company says the Cefaly device will be available in early April to migraine patients in the U.S. by prescription-only. It can be ordered at www.cefaly.us. The cost is $295 plus $29 shipping.A company produced video of the stimulator can be seen here:Another recent study of the Cefaly device found that over half of the migraine sufferers who tried it were so satisfied at the conclusion of a 40-day study that they decided to purchase the device.Over 2,300 migraine sufferers volunteered to try the device in a study published online in the Journal of Headache and Pain. The participants lived in Belgium, France or Switzerland; three countries where they could rent or buy the Cefaly stimulator over the Internet without a medical prescription.At the conclusion of the study, over 54% of the participants were satisfied with the treatment and were willing to purchase the device. The remaining 46% of the Cefaly renters were not satisfied and returned it – although a compliance check found that many had not used the device for the recommended time and some never even turned it on.Side effects such as fatigue, insomnia, and pain were reported by about 4% of the patients.In December, 2013 the FDA approved the marketing of the first transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device for the relief of pain caused by migraine preceded by an aura. Studies show the device is effective about a third of the time.The Cerena TMS is a handheld prescription device meant to be used after the onset of migraine pain. The device is placed at the back of the head to release a pulse of magnetic energy to the occipital cortex in the brain, which may stop or lessen the pain associated with migraine headaches.I’m glad to hear that the fda is paying some attention to devices for pain, and hopefully the device is affordable.
I know there is a “migraine zapper” that is used during a migraine as abortive treatment, but I am unfamiliar with the research."	Health

It’s not a scene from Star Trek and she’s not predicting the future.  What you see here is the first ever approved nerve-stimulating headband proven to prevent migraine headaches drug free.  Applause, but do so quietly! I hope those suffering from chronic migraines are rejoicing with silent fist pumps.The Migraine HeadbandImage courtesy of the dailymail.comThe word migraine derives from the Greek word hemikrania, “pain on one side of the head,” which is exactly what a migraine is.  Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light.  The pain is pulsating in nature, lasting anywhere from 2 to 72 hours!Migraines are a slow torture leaving many people trapped in dark rooms for hours. I hope you are not getting a headache from these excruciating details! The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it approved a nerve-stimulating headband as the first medical device to prevent migraine headaches.Agency officials said the device provides a new option for patients who cannot tolerate migraine medications.The Cefaly device is a battery-powered plastic band worn across the forehead. Using an adhesive electrode, the band emits a low electrical current to stimulate nerves associated with migraine pain. Users may feel a tingling sensation on the skin where the electrode is applied. The device is designed to be used no more than 20 minutes a day by patients 18 years and older.A 67-person study reviewed by the FDA showed patients using the device experienced fewer migraines per month than patients using a placebo device. The Cefaly headband did not completely eliminate migraine headaches or reduce the intensity of migraines that occurred.About 53 percent of 2,313 patients in a separate study said they were satisfied with the device and were willing to purchase it for future use.No serious adverse events were connected with the device.Cephaly is manufactured by Cephaly Technology of Belgium. The facts of this article were contributed by the Associated Press.The First Ever Migraine Headband Approved by the FDA"	Health

90	"PRESS RELEASEToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed marketing of the first device as a preventative treatment for migraine headaches. This is also the first transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device specifically authorized for use prior to the onset of pain.“Cefaly provides an alternative to medication for migraine prevention,” said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks.”Migraine headaches are characterized by intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head, accompanied by nausea or vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. A migraine can last from four to 72 hours when left untreated. According to the National Institutes of Health, these debilitating headaches affect approximately 10 percent of people worldwide and are three times more common in women than men.Cefaly is a small, portable, battery-powered, prescription device that resembles a plastic headband worn across the forehead and atop the ears. The user positions the device in the center of the forehead, just above the eyes, using a self-adhesive electrode. The device applies an electric current to the skin and underlying body tissues to stimulate branches of the trigeminal nerve, which has been associated with migraine headaches. The user may feel a tingling or massaging sensation where the electrode is applied. Cefaly is indicated for patients 18 years of age and older and should only be used once per day for 20 minutes.The FDA reviewed the data for Cefaly through the de novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for generally low- to moderate-risk medical devices that are not substantially equivalent to an already legally marketed device.The agency evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the device based on data from a clinical study conducted in Belgium involving 67 individuals who experienced more than two migraine headache attacks a month and who had not taken any medications to prevent migraines for three months prior to using Cefaly, as well as a patient satisfaction study of 2,313 Cefaly users in France and Belgium.The 67-person study showed that those who used Cefaly experienced significantly fewer days with migraines per month and used less migraine attack medication than those who used a placebo device. The device did not completely prevent migraines and did not reduce the intensity of migraines that did occur.The patient satisfaction study showed that a little more than 53 percent of patients were satisfied with Cefaly treatment and willing to buy the device for continued use. The most commonly reported complaints were dislike of the feeling and not wanting to continue using the device, sleepiness during the treatment session, and headache after the treatment session.No serious adverse events occurred during either study.Cephaly is manufactured by Cephaly Technology in Herstal, Liege, Belgium.The Dispatch - The generic Dispatch designation, used primarily for press releases or syndicated content, but may be used for guest author requesting a generic nomenclature[…]          […][…]          […]

91	"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againJust approved by the FDA, the device directs an electric current to the skin and underlying body tissue, stimulating a nerve associated with migraines.If you're among the roughly 10 percent of people who suffer from migraines, there's a new device on the market that could help prevent those debilitating headaches in the first place.Made by Cefaly Technology in Belgium, the device, simply called Cefaly,  is an electronic headband that sits over the ears and across the  forehead, just above the eyes. A self-adhesive electrode sends an  electric current to the skin and the tissue just beneath it to stimulate  a nerve (the trigeminal) that Cefaly says has been associated with migraines.Though the Food and Drug Administration just approved the device today,  to be used by prescription only and for no more than 20 minutes a day,  it's already available in other countries -- including Canada, where it  costs $300.The FDA says it approved Cefaly because of a clinical trial in  Belgium showing that, of the 67 participants who suffered through  migraines at least twice a month and hadn't taken meds for the headaches  in the three months leading up to the study, those who used Cefaly  spent ""significantly fewer"" days dealing with migraines than those using  a placebo device.Cefaly Technology also points to a study it conducted involving 2,300  users in Belgium and France, in which it found that 53 percent of  participants reported being satisfied enough to buy one. And while a  coin toss may not seem terribly impressive, and some users complained of  sleepiness during the treatments and headaches after, it's no small  feat that more than half the participants liked it enough to want to buy  it.Perhaps the best finding is that no serious side effects have yet to be associated with the headband.""This device is a promising step forward in treating migraine  headaches, as it addresses an important part of what we believe triggers  and maintains a migraine attack,"" Dr. Myrna Cardiel, a clinical  associate professor of neurology at NYU Langone Medical Center and NYU  School of Medicine, told HealthDay. She added that the 53 percent  positive rating is on par with ""most oral migraine preventive  medications.""Cefaly Technology should be coming out with more purchasing details  soon.

92	Reuters Staff2 Min ReadMarch 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it approved a nerve-stimulating device to prevent migraines that is worn as a band across the forehead. The battery-powered device, which should be positioned above the eyes, sends an electric current to the skin and underlying tissue via a self-adhesive electrode to stimulate the trigeminal nerve that is associated with migraines. Manufactured by Belgium-based CEFALY Technology SPRL, the prescription-only device is intended for use once per day for 20 minutes. FDA said it was the first medical device to be approved as a preventive treatment for the severe headaches. “This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks,” said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. About 10 percent of people worldwide suffer from migraines, according to the National Institutes of Health. Characterized by intense pain in one area of the head accompanied by nausea or vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound, a migraine can last from four to 72 hours if untreated. Drugs to treat migraines called triptans, which include generic forms of GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s Imitrex (sumatriptan), have cardiovascular side effects that make them inappropriate for many patients and for long-term use. The CEFALY device is for patients 18 and older. FDA said in a clinical study of 67 patients in Belgium, those who used the device had significantly fewer migraines per month and used less medication than those who used a placebo device. The device did not reduce the intensity of migraines that occurred.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2018 Reuters.

93	Daily DoseThe US Food and Drug Administration gave the thumbs-up on Tuesday for the first device to prevent migraines in those who have the headaches on a regular basis. It’s likely safe but how well it works remains questionable since it was only tested in 67 people before it was approved.Cefaly, the name of the new device, “provides an alternative to medication for migraine prevention,” Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement. “This may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks.” It’s a small, portable, battery-powered, device that resembles a plastic headband worn across the forehead and on top of the ears that delivers electrical impulses to stimulate the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to be involved in the onset of pain. The device is indicated for those 18 years of age and older, and should be used no more than once a day for 20 minutes at a time, according to the FDA.To approve the device, the FDA looked at data from a small clinical study conducted in Belgium involving 67 people who experienced more than two migraine headache attacks a month and who had not taken any drugs to prevent migraines for three months before entering the study. Those who used Cefaly experienced significantly fewer days per month with migraines and used lower doses of painkillers to relieve their headaches compared to those who used a placebo device. But Cefaly didn’t prevent migraines completely.A patient satisfacton survey involving 2,313 Cefaly French and Belgian users that the Belgium-based manufacturer provided to the FDA found that about 53 percent of users were satisfied with Cefaly treatment and willing to buy the device for continued use. The most commonly reported complaints were dislike of the tingling sensation caused by the device, sleepiness during the treatment session, and headache after the treatment session. No serious side effects were reported during either study, according to the FDA. The device retails for the equivalent of $225 on the Canadian Costco website.© 2018 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC	Health

                                            (Newser)
                                        –
                                        After a social media campaign—and an avalanche of bad publicity—a drug company has done a U-turn and agreed to give a dying 7-year-old boy an experimental drug that could save his life. The FDA allows ""compassionate use""of unapproved drugs in such cases, but the Chimerix pharmaceutical company had insisted that giving the drug to Josh Hardy, who developed a bone marrow disorder after cancer treatment, would delay efforts to get it to market, CNN reports.
                                    
                                        Chimerix president Kenneth Moch says Josh will be the first patient in a pilot trial for the drug. ""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make,"" says Moch, who tells the Fredericksburg Lance-Star that he and his employees have received death threats amid a flood of pleas to help the Virginia boy. Josh is expected to receive the drug within 48 hours, though his mother fears he is running out of time. ""Even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him,"" she tells Fox News. ""But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery.""

Family and supporters of a 7-year-old boy dying from a rare bone marrow disorder were ecstatic Wednesday, after a drug company reversed its decision to deny him an experimental medicine that could save his life.""We’re just looking forward to the great success of the drug and the great success of the company to help other people, just tremendously excited,"" Aimee Hardy, mother of Josh Hardy, of Fredericksburg, Va., told Fox & Friends Wednesday morning. ""As hard as we were as a group on the company, we’re going to push Josh to continue to do his best so that he can make that full recovery."" Hardy spoke after pharmaceutical company Chimerix said Tuesday night it will begin a pilot trial for the drug brincidofovir, with Josh set to be the program’s first patient beginning immediately. Chimerix faced intense media scrutiny after it reportedly denied the medication to Josh, who developed the bone marrow disorder as a result of his cancer treatments late last year.At one point, CEO Kenneth I. Moch had been accused of hanging up in a phone call from a representative from a charity that had offered to pay for the medication.However, Moch said in a statement Tuesday night that the company would provide the much-needed drug.""This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need -- for everyone,"" Moch said. ""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.""Through a grassroots campaign launched by Josh’s mother, Chimerix had received hundreds of phone calls and emails in support of Josh, and the hashtag #savejosh had been trending on Twitter. Supporters even chartered buses so they could protest at the company’s headquarters.Although support for Josh is strong, Hardy’s mother, Aimee Hardy, has said her son is running out of time.""He’s still kind of weak, but I really am optimistic about the potential of this drug and I really feel like within a couple weeks we’re going to see a turnaround and get him in the right direction,"" she told the Fox News morning show. ""It was a tremendous gift.""Dr. Robert Hariri, the CEO of the biotechnology company Celgene, told FoxNews.com on Tuesday that colleagues in the industry ""look to a company like Chimerix to provide an example of being heroic in these situations for the best interest of society.""""We all run into problems where potentially life-saving therapies which are in development and under investigation are called upon by people who have no other choices, and who will die whether they receive the experimental therapy or not,"" he said. ""And we’re often facing the very complicated decisions on whether to potentially jeopardize the development of a drug or product because there’s need for compassionate use.”View AllThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

102	"A Durham-based drug company has recently grabbed national attention as it has declined to donate its potential lifesaving drug to a critically ill 7-year-old boy.Chimerix, a drug company that has none of its products available in the market, has been developing a virus-killing drug for the past 13 years, which is desperately required by the family of an ailing boy, Josh Hardy. Josh has been fighting from the fatal adenovirus after undergoing a bone-marrow transplant.The drug - Brincidofovir (CMX001) is not expected to win approval for public use until 2016 and Chimerix has not confirmed as to how much the drug might cost per dose, according to a report in Sacramento Bee.Between 2009 and 2012, Chimerix has distributed the drug to as many as 430 patients. But since then it have stopped its compassionate care program as the drug has reached advanced stages of testing and development.""Getting the drug approved - to where it would be widely available and covered by insurance - must be a drug developer's priority, even if it means turning down requests from people who need the drug. This is an ethical dilemma of substance. We are heartstricken about this child,"" said Kenneth Moch, Chimerix CEO.The Hardy family, who was one of the trending topics on Twitter on Monday, intends to telecast a protest at the headquarters of the drug company with an aim to break the company's corporate will.""This is the first time people have tried to use this kind of pressure. If we were to make this drug available for Josh Hardy, then others could make the same request. Could we say 'no' to them? Wouldn't they start a similar campaign?"" said Moch.The family is requesting Chimerix to continue with their established compassionate care program through which pharmaceutical companies used to distribute under developing medications to critically ill patients who have no other option left for treatment. However, the treatment carries risk as these medicines may lead to severe side effects or may be ineffective.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority to permit such an emergency in less than a day, but to qualify the grant, the patient has to suffer a life threatening disease with no treatment options.""Compassionate use involves unidentified risk and may create a false sense of hope in patients,"" according to the standards set by the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical firm. ""Compassionate use also can negatively impact the operations of new or ongoing clinical studies and subsequently delay the approval of a new medication."" He added.Brincidofovir is available only to limited number of patients. Patients who have previously undergone clinical trials on the drug were only the ones suffering from pox viruses or newborns infected with herpes simplex virus, the drug company clarified.Josh's infection raised another obstacle with the use of the drug Brincidofovir, as the antiviral drug was developed to prevent infection and not treat them. On that ground, it is not clear whether the drug would help Josh recover, explained Moch.Agreeing to public appeals could undermine the growth of experimental drugs and hamper the health care system that favors some over others, according to Arthur Caplan, Head of the Medical Ethics Division, NYU Langone Medical Center.(Edited by Anu James)"	Health

be given a new lease on life through an experimental drug   previously denied to

A Durham drug maker announced Tuesday evening that it will provide critical
drugs for a dying 7-year-old boy after his family put pressure on the company
to do so, largely through social media.  - Advertisement -

Supporters of a dying 7-year-old had planned to travel to Durham Thursday to
convince drug maker Chimerix to release an experimental drug that could save
the boy.
""Josh's Army"", numbering in the tens of thousands, responded to his
dilemma last week with angry tweets and notes on Facebook, and Chimerix's
executives have gotten death threats. They screamed for ""compassionate
use.""CNN
Here's the way it [compassionate use] works:   According
to the Food and Drug Administration, if someone has a serious or
immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available
treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they're
still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA.
The All Or Nothing Dillemma
Chimerix, the producer of the experimental drug brincidofovir, at first denied
the drug because it was not yet approved by the FDA for Josh's kind of virus.
That's when people started screaming ""compassionate use"" at Chimerix.
But the company said that if they gave it to Josh, they would have to give it
to the hundreds of others waiting for it - at $50,000 each - a sum that would
significantly halt the research on the drug. Chimerix is not a large company -
it employs only about 50 people. Not all drug companies are big, bad conglomerates, so Chimerix worked out a deal with the FDA.     - Advertisement -

For the Chimerix/FDA solution, read HERE. 
Let's hope that the combined efforts of Josh, his parents, Facebook,
change.org, the FDA and, yes, Chimerix produce the results everyone is hoping
for.

104	 WASHINGTON — Josh Hardy, the Fredericksburg first-grader who is battling a possibly life-threatening virus, will receive the drug that may save him.  The Free-Lance Star reports that Hardy, who is at the St. Jude Children’s Research Center in Memphis, Tenn., will be given the drug to fight the adenovirus he developed after a bone-marrow transplant as a cancer treatment.  The drug that might save him, called Brincindofovir, has not been approved by the FDA, but the drug-maker Chimerix, after consulting with the agency, has set up a new clinical trial.  “We have been working aggressively and intimately with the FDA for a long period of time,” Kenneth Moch, the president and CEO of Chimerix, told The Free Lance-Star on Tuesday.  Moch told the Free-Lance Star that the company had already been negotiating with the FDA, but couldn’t tell anyone because they didn’t want to raise hopes.  Josh’s grandmother Mae Staton told NBC Washington she was ecstatic when she heard the news.  “We were all so excited. I screamed when I heard the news from my daughter,” Staton told NBC Washington.   Staton says the drug is the last hope for Josh.  “[The doctors] said without this drug, that Josh could not survive,” she told NBC Washington.  Aimee Hardy, Josh’s mom, let the supporters know about the good news on her Facebook page.  “Glory to GOD. They are releasing the drug to Josh!!!!!” Amy wrote, according to the paper.  Josh may get the drug as early as Wednesday.  Watch the NBC Washington report below:    Follow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.Need a break? Play a quick game of solitaire or Sudoku.

105	"Last week, a North Carolina drug company told the parents of a dying seven-year-old that they couldn't sell him a potentially life-saving treatment because doing so would slow their efforts to get the drug to market.Seven-year-old Josh Hardy had already beat cancer three times, before he caught a virus in January that put him in heart and kidney failure, vomiting blood multiple times a day.His doctors said an unapproved anti-viral drug called brincidofovir could save his life. But when Josh's parents petitioned the manufacturer, Chimerix, for a compassionate care exception, they were shot downWhen asked how he will feel if Josh dies — and he's in critical condition, so sadly that could happen soon — the president of the company that makes the drug doesn't hesitate to answer.""Horrible,"" said Kenneth Moch. He would feel horrible and heartbroken.But still, he said there's no way he's going to change his mind. There's no way he's going to give Josh this drug.The FDA's compassionate care exceptionMoch told CNN that Chimerix wouldn't help Josh because of the high cost—approximately $50,000—and because it would ""divert manpower"" from the 50-odd employee company. But when a representative from the Max Cure Foundation offered to cover the costAn NYU bioethicist said that companies can also be resistant to compassionate care exceptions because they can skew the drug trials:It's not just the $50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish, Caplan said, but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug. Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug.But the bad press eventually outweighed those concerns, and the company found a workaround: today Chimerix announced Josh will be the first patient in a new clinical trial""I'm happy for Josh and I'm happy for many patients,"" Moch told CNN. ""We've come up with a way of helping not just Josh, but helping other patients in need, and there are many.""[image via Facebook"	Health

  Josh Hardy has been battling various forms of cancer since he was
  only nine months old. Whether it was in his kidneys, thymus,
  lungs, or bone marrow, the boy managed to overcome the disease
  every time.

  After a bone marrow transplant severely damaged what remained of
  his immune system, though, doctors discovered in February that a
  viral infection currently spreading through his body is putting
  his life in danger. As noted by CNN, he is currently in critical
  condition and vomits blood multiple times every hour.

  The attending doctor told Todd Hardy, Josh's father, there is one
  drug that “will cure and save” the boy, currently being
  developed by North Carolina-based Chimerix. Despite “multiple
  requests” made by St. Jude’s Children Research Hospital in
  Memphis, Tennessee, however, the company has declined the provide
  the medication.
""Our son will die without this drug,"" Todd Hardy told
  CNN. ""We're begging them to give it to us.""
  When asked why the company won’t supply the antiviral called
  brincidofovir, Chimerix President and CEO Kenneth Moch said that
  if it did for one patient, it would have to do it for all the
  others who request it.
""We have have great compassion for this family,"" Moch
  said to USA Today. ""But this is not just about a single
  boy.""""If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this
  would be a very different question,"" he added to CNN.
  ""But it's yes to all or no to all.""
  The Hardys' plight inspired Internet users from all over the
  world to use social media to pressure the company to change its
  stance. In a statement Tuesday, Chimerix revealed, the pressure
  worked - Josh will be one of 20 patients to receive an
  experimental clinical trial of the drug. While the Food and Drug
  Administration has yet to approve the drug, the agency did grant
  Chimerix permission to carryout the trial.

  Josh's family is staying with him at St. Jude Children's Research
  Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. From there they thanked
  supporters via Facebook.

  ""You did it. You Saved Josh. Thank you Chimerix and Josh's
  Army,"" they wrote.

  Under the “compassionate use” procedures outlined by the Food and Drug Administration,
  if traditional treatments have failed to cure a patient, they can
  request experimental drugs from companies even if the government
  has not yet approved them. Many companies accommodate the
  request, but oftentimes pharmaceuticals – such as Chimerix –
  decline to fulfill such applications.

  According to CNN, Moch said Chimerix would have had to pay out
  $50,000 per compassionate use request it fulfills due to the fact
  that insurance doesn’t cover unapproved drugs. At the same time,
  he added that diverting resources to expanding its compassionate
  use coverage would simply delay the drug’s official approval,
  thereby hurting many other patients by slowing its arrival on the
  market.

  In the statement Tuesday announcing Josh would be given the drug
  Moch said, ""Being unable to fulfill requests for
  compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of
  us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each
  individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and
  value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical
  study of brincidofovir.""

  Chimerix has provided brincidofovir to 430 compassionate use
  patients in the past, but initially said that in the case of Josh
  Hardy, the boy does not meet the requirements for any of its
  ongoing test trials.The statement advised that while being
  administered the drug is a positive step, there is still a long
  way to go.

  ""This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by
  the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has
  not yet been established for use in children,"" it continued.
  ""It is also important to understand that this remains a
  critical and complex medical situation.""

110	"(WMC-TV) - In some pictures, 7-year-old Josh Hardy boasts a big smile in sports jerseys, but the last three months in the intensive care unit at St. Jude Children's Hospital has replaced the eye black with tubes and gauze.  A company's decision Tuesday to provide drug access could be a game changer in the fight for Josh's life. Initially, Chimerix refused to give brincidofovir—a drug that might cure Josh's adenovirus infection—because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had yet to approve it. ""They have given us excuses about challenging them financially, but we really don't care what excuses there are. They have something that can help our son, and we as parents are going to do everything we can possible do to help him. The thing is he's had  a very challenged life,"" said mother Aimee Hardy Monday.  Josh has been fighting life-threatening illnesses since he was 9 months old, when he battled a rare kidney cancer called malignant rhabdoid tumor. Shortly after Josh was cured of the tumor, doctors discovered a pre-leukemia like cancer that required a bone marrow transplant; receiving treatment sent him to the ICU in January. Aimee says her son's current infection—actively targeting his heart and kidney—would continue to move throughout his body without the drug. Josh gained national attention after the family's determination to gain a dosage. In a news release, Chimerix announced they reached a deal with the FDA for the immediate initiation of a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients. ""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections,"" said Chimerix president and CEO Kenneth I. Moch. Chimerix credited Josh's story for the acceleration of their discussion with the FDA concerning adenovirus patients. Aimee said the FDA may not approve the drug before 2016, which would have not been acceptable for her son.St. Jude calls the drug experimental because it is not approved. The safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children, according to a statement. They will administer it under a new treatment protocol as approved by a committee. The hospital received the drug Wednesday. A post on the #SaveJosh Facebook page thanked thousands of followers for support in addition to the employees and board members of Chimerix. Copyright 2014 WMC-TV.

111	"A small biotechnology company agreed Tuesday evening to make an experimental drug available to a gravely ill Virginia boy who contracted an infection while he was being treated for cancer. Though the company, Chimerix, first said it could not help 7-year-old Josh Hardy without others expecting the same treatment, it reversed course in a statement released Tuesday night.Josh, of Fredericksburg, developed adenovirus, a bone marrow disorder, following years of cancer treatments. He will be the first patient to get the drug, brincidofovir, Fox News reported. Chimerix endured a storm of outrage after it first reportedly denied him the medication.  According to Fox News, it was rumored that CEO Kenneth I. Moch hung up on phone call with a representative from a charity who offered to pay for the medication. But on Tuesday, Moch said the company would supply Josh with the much-needed medicine.""This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need -- for everyone,"" Moch said. ""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.""Josh’s mother, Aimee Hardy, has been credited with starting the campaign to get her son the help he needs. Chimerix reportedly received hundreds of emails and phone calls in support of Josh, with the hashtag #savejosh becoming a trending topic on Twitter.Though the immediate news for Josh is positive, Aimee explained he doesn’t have much time. “It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him,” Hardy told Fox News. “But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery.”According to CNN, Josh was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer when he was 9 months old. Over the years, Josh would go on to be diagnosed with cancer in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time he beat it. But the bone marrow transplant didn’t leave Josh with much of an immune system and he soon contracted a virus.His doctors at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis said in a statement Josh should receive the drug within 48 hours, but it’s unclear if it will be effective for children. ""St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients. We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome,” the hospital said, according to CNN. ""We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.""Follow me on Twitter @mariamzzarellaSubscribe"	Health

113	"A 7-year-old boy who has beaten cancer four times but whose weakened immune system is being threatened by a rare virus will start receiving an experimental treatment within 48 hours  after the drug's manufacturer reached an agreement with federal officials for a pilot trial to begin immediately.The boy, Josh Hardy, will be the first patient to be enrolled Wednesday in the new study of the drug, brincidofovir, the Durham, N.C.-based company, Chimerix, announced late Tuesday. Earlier the company had said it could not release the drug to Josh  outside of clinical trials. The boy's family had been pleading with the  company to change its mind. ""Josh Hardy's story brought to public attention the often-devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix regarding the need for additional clinical development to assess brincidofovir's potential in adenovirus infection,"" Kenneth I. Moch, Chimerix's president and CEO, said in a statement.Chimerix had said earlier that it could not comply with a compassionate-use request  for several reasons, including the fact that many other sick children  had filed such requests.Moch had also said that prescribing the drug outside of Phase 3  clinical trials underway to determine its safety and efficacy might  derail that process. While it is not certain that the drug will help Josh, his family and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis have said it might be the boy's only hope.  ""This virus has really done a number on his little body, he's bleeding internally and he's in a lot of pain,"" his grandmother Mae Staton told the CBS affiliate WTVR in Richmond, Va. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital said it had been notified by Chimerix that it would receive brincidofovir within the next 48 hours to treat Josh's adenovirus.""This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children,"" the hospital said in a statement.The drug will be administered under a new treatment protocol as approved by a committee charged with compliance to federal and institutional regulations for clinical research, it said.""It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,"" it said.  Josh, who is from Fredericksburg, Va., was diagnosed with cancer in his kidneys while he was 9 months old, said Staton, and he has defeated it three more times since. Last November, doctors determined he needed a bone marrow transplant due to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. It is a tough-to-treat disease of the blood and bone marrow that occurs following chemotherapy or radiation that prevents blood stem cells from maturing into healthy cells, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The bone marrow transplant took place in January at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.Josh was in a coma for 16 days after, his grandmother said, and once he came out of it, he developed a gastrointestinal adenovirus, which is a family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from respiratory infections to fever, diarrhea, pink eye, bladder infections and rashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.People with weakened immune system are at higher risk from getting sick from an adenovirus infection. According to a March 5 letter from Dr. Victor Santana, associate director for clinical research at St. Jude -- which was posted on the ""SaveJosh"" Facebook page -- conventional treatments have not fought off the virus, and the boy's life is in danger. He wrote that St. Jude approached Chimerix  on Feb. 12 with a compassionate-use application for brincidofovir, but the request was denied. Afterwards, the hospital tried standard treatment but it led to kidney failure and Josh needed dialysis.Santana expressed concern that after having fought childhood cancer for so long, Josh might succumb to the virus that was increasing in his body.In the statement issued late Tuesday, Moch said: ""This 20-patient  open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative  antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone. Being  unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and  not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make.""

	A pharmaceutical company says they will begin a potentially life-saving drug trial for a dying 7-year-old Virginia boy after first denying his family’s desperate request.
	Chimerix’s decision Tuesday means that Josh Hardy will be the first enrolled in the previously unapproved medication's trial that, according to his mother, will give him a shot at life.
	His treatment with Brincidofovir, to fight off a viral infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant, will begin Wednesday the firm announced.
	Josh's mother, Aimee Hardy of Fredericksburg, had strenuously campaigned for the North Carolina firm to supply her son with the drug she argued would clear up his condition within two weeks.
	As Tuesday’s decision shows, both Chimerix and the Food and Drug Administration didn’t miss hearing her cries.
	“Josh Hardy's story brought to public attention the often-devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix regarding the need for additional clinical development to assess brincidofovir's potential in adenovirus infection,” the firm said in a release.
	""This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone,"" said Kenneth I. Moch, President & CEO of Chimerix.
	""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.""
	Previously, the firm gave patients access through its ""compassionate use"" program.
	But bosses decided two years ago to discontinue the scheme because it was too expensive, despite being handed $72 million in federal funding.
	Since then they started focusing their efforts on gaining FDA approval, said Moch.
	""As we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials, we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning FDA approval,"" Moch said.
	Moch told CNN he would feel ""horrible"" and ""heartbroken"" if Josh died. But he said that giving Josh the drug would also mean having to give it to other patients, which would further drain company cash and delay the FDA approval process.
	Josh, diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007, has fought the deadly disease four times. 
	In remission from 2011, he discovered in Nov. 2013 that he had a bone marrow disorder due to earlier treatments.
	After undergoing a bone marrow transplant at St. Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., he then developed the adenovirus infection.
	Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, reports Fox and Friends.
	Asking supporters to call, email or tweet @Chimerix with the hashtag #savejosh, Hardy had said she wouldn't stop her fight.
	""I feel that it's just an excuse and we need them to totally change their stance, not only for us but for hundreds or even thousands of people that need [this drug],"" she told Fox News.
	""To me, [it's] almost a crime to not make it available to everyone who needs it,"" she added.

Now, a viral infection has invaded his tiny body and left him fighting for his life again.

The drug, made by the company Chimerix, has not yet been approved by the FDA, but has been proven to clear up adenovirus in children within just two weeks.[hl_ndn videoid=”25692186″]However, Chimerix has denied the Hardy family’s request for Josh to receive the drug claiming that it would be too expensive and would slow down their quest for FDA approval. According to the company’s president Kenneth Moch, allowing Josh the drugs he needs would set the company back by $50,000.Aimee and Todd refuse to let their little boy lose his life because of Chimerix’s denial, and instead have started an online campaign hoping to change the company’s mind. #SaveJosh now has over 19,000 likes on Facebook and has garnered the attention of multiple high-profile media outlets.

Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body.Now he’s in critical condition in an intensive care unit as the virus ravages his body.His doctors at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis had also been pushing for the company to provide the drug.In a statement Tuesday, the hospital said it expected to receive the medication within 48 hours, but noted that its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established for use in children.“It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,” the hospital said.“St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients. We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.”An FDA policy known as “compassionate use” allows someone with a serious or life-threatening disease to ask a drug company for an experimental drug.Though it’s called compassionate use, sometimes it feels anything but compassionate.Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013.But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as Chimerix did at first to Josh Hardy.Chimerix President Kenneth Moch previously told CNN he wouldn’t back down from his decision not to give Josh the drug.In the company’s statement Tuesday, he said he hopes the new study will help other patients as well.“This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix’s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need — for everyone,” he said. “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.”Filed in: News The company is not denying Josh the drug because it’s evil or because of money – it’s denying because providing the drug would likely delay FDA approval by months or years. The federal government Chimirex $72M to run a CLINICAL TRIAL — which does NOT require it (or any other pharmaceutical company) to distribute an unapproved drug on a “compassionate use” basis.Do you know WHY there are stringent laws/regulations governing clinical trials? Because 1) it ensures that drugs are safe before doctors are allowed to prescribe them and 2) stops horrors like the infamous Tuskegee Experiment from EVER happening again.  The laws/regs are NEEDED.Last but not least, there are multiple stages to a clinical trial – in this particular case, the FDA has deemed it safe (Phase 1), effective relative to placebo (Phase 2) and is in the process of confirming it to be safe/effective (Phase 3).  The drug was NOT designed to fight the type of infection little Josh is battling, so if he got the drug and had an adverse reaction for any reason (e.g. so sick that he died anyways, reacts badly with the other drugs he’s taken, etc), Chimirex is required to report it to the FDA, which will delay FDA approval by months or years while the reason for the adverse effect is investigated.My heart goes out to Josh and his family – but the drug company is making the RIGHT call by refusing to give him the drug.They got it!!!!

122	This week the story of 7-Year-Old Memphis boy Josh Hardy exploded all over the internet after it was revealed he was dying from an infection of adenovirus spreading in his body.  The family’s only hope was a drug brincidofovir, that was still in clinical trials and not approved by the FDA to be used openly.Josh was 9 months old when he was first diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But after a bone marrow transplant Josh’s immune system weakened and last year doctors detected an infection of adenovirus spreading in his body.They gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys.Doctors at the St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital had been part of the study of this particular drug and assured the family that if the intravenous dosage had failed, the one given orally could be given without damaging the kidneys. They proceeded to ask the manufacturers Chimerix Inc. to use the experimental drug.Twice the doctors at St. Jude’s requested that Josh be granted permission to use the drug, and both times the company turned them down stating that they were not “in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources.”The internet went crazy.  Concerned members of ‘Josh’s Army’ responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to “open their hearts,” asking the executives how they can sleep at night.Others have begun sending mails to board members. Chimerix executives say they have also received death threats.The company stood firm noting that they were “going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone.”But in  a turn of events Chimerix, Inc. today announced through a press release that it has reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the immediate initiation of a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients. FDA has committed to work expeditiously with Chimerix on the design of a pivotal Phase 3 study that would be a continuation of this pilot study. Josh Hardy’s story brought to public attention the often-devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix regarding the need for additional clinical development to assess brincidofovir’s potential in adenovirus infection. This study is expected to begin with Josh Hardy as the first patient enrolled on Wednesday, March 12, 2014.“This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix’s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need – for everyone,” said Kenneth I. Moch, President & CEO of Chimerix. “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.”“We are pleased to be providing access to brincidofovir in a manner consistent with our focus on progressing clinical development toward a potential regulatory approval that would make it widely available to patients who might benefit from its use,” said Hervé Momméja-Marin, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Research of Chimerix. “We are grateful to the FDA for their continuous guidance and assistance in expediting brincidofovir’s development path forward.”We pray that this will be the answer this family is looking for to heal their son. He has fought for too long and we hope this is the medicine that allows him to join his family at home.They thanked their fans on Facebook this evening saying,The world has heard you and because of you Josh and many others will have the opportunity to receive CMX001 (Brincidofovir) the life saving antiviral drug made by Chimerix. There are too many people to thank individually, everyone’s actions, thoughts and prayers have made a difference.SAHM of 2 boys and founder of GrowingYourBaby.com, World Traveled Family and The World We Share.

So the Hardys have started several online petitions to change the company’s mind.""Having survived four diagnoses of cancer, it would be an absolute travesty for him to meet his demise from a virus,"" his mother, Aimee Hardy, told ABCNews.com. ""Especially knowing there is a medicine in someone’s hands that can rid of this virus.""Josh received his first cancer diagnosis when he was just a baby: Aggressive rhabdoid tumors in both kidneys, Hardy said. He went through surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, but the cancer returned in his thalamus gland and then his lung.Then, after nearly four years of being cancer-free, Josh received bad news in November 2013, Hardy said. He had myelodysplastic syndrome –- the same precancerous bone marrow disorder that ABC News anchor Robin Roberts was diagnosed with in 2012. This can be caused by cancer treatments.Josh underwent a bone marrow transplant to remedy the disorder, but he developed graft versus host disease -- meaning the new cells started to attack his body, Hardy said.Read more of this story from Good Morning America here. © 2018 Cox Media Group.By using this website, you accept the terms of our Visitor Agreement and Privacy Policy, and understand your options regarding Ad Choices.This station is part of Cox Media Group Television.Learn about careers at Cox Media Group."

129	"FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (CBSDC) — A drug company has decided to let a 7-year-old boy who is suffering from a rare life-threatening disease be treated with an experimental drug, despite initially denying the family the drug.The decision from Chimerix came from public backlash for denying the drug to Josh Hardy, who is currently suffering from gastrointestinal adenovirus and who has also battled kidney cancer four times since he was 9 months old.Mae Staton, grandmother to Josh Hardy, initially told WTVR-TV that Chimerix wouldn’t supply the Hardy family with the drug brincidofovir, despite doctors believing it can help the child suffering from the deadly disease.“This virus has really done a number on his little body, he’s bleeding internally and he’s in a lot of pain,” Staton told WTVR.He contracted the virus after getting a bone marrow transplant in January at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital when a checkup last November found blood irregularity, which turned out to be a rare disease known as secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. He was in a coma for 16 days following the transplant.After coming out of the coma, he developed the deadly gastrointestinal adenovirus.“He’s a tough little fella,” Staton told WTVR.In a statement released Tuesday, Chimerix announced that Josh will be the first patient enrolled in a pilot trial for treatment.“This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix’s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need – for everyone,” Ken Moch, CEO of Chimerix, said in a statement. “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.”The Save Josh Facebook page thanked everyone who supported them.“You did it. You saved Josh. Thank you Chimerix and Josh’s Army,” the post stated.Josh will be enrolled in the trial Wednesday.(TM and Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

130	A Fredericksburg family that has been fighting for the release of a drug that has the potential to save their son's life found out tonight that drug would be made available immediately. The family of Josh Hardy, a young man suffering from cancer, has been fighting for the release of brincidofovir, a drug that should help the 7-year-old recover from adenovirus. Josh came down with the virus after a recent bone marrow transplant. He is currently being treated at St. Jude's Medical Center in Memphis. The family has been lobbying Chimerix to release the drug which is currently being studied in preparation for a full release. Tonight on the family's facebook page they announced that Chimerix had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to release the drug to Josh as part of a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients.We will have more on the announcement tonight on NBC12 News at 11.Copyright 2014 WWBT NBC12.

131	UPDATE — 9:07 p.m. ET: The drug company has reportedly reversed their decision and will now provide the much-needed medicine to 7-year-old Josh Hardy.[blackbirdpie url=”https://twitter.com/foxnewsalert/status/443553465596669952″]—He’s survived four battles with kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant.But now 7-year-old Josh Hardy’s life might be in jeopardy once again. This time, because a drug company has denied him access to medication that holds a potential cure for a deadly virus — even after a charity offered to pay for it.After living two years cancer-free, doctors discovered Hardy had a bone marrow transplant in Nov. 2013 during a bone scan. He subsequently underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in Jan. 2014. Following the procedure, however, the 7-year-old boy developed adenovirus — an infection that can be fatal when it strikes individuals with compromised immune systems, according to Fox News.“Normally, Josh’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,” Hardy’s mother, Aimee, wrote on her son’s CaringBridge.org page. “The challenge is his immune system can’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.”According to Fox News, doctors at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital recommended the 7-year-old be treated with the antiviral drug Brincidofovir — a drug that has yet to receive FDA approval.In the past, however, the company that makes the drug, Chimerix, has allowed access to the medicine for certain patients. Now, despite receiving $72 million in federal funding, the drug company says “they cannot afford it.”“As we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials, we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning FDA approval,” Kenneth Moch, the CEO of Chimerix, told Fox News.Moch added to CNN that helping Josh might actually hurt others, since his small 50-person company would be forced to redirect resources to his one particular case, instead of focusing on gaining FDA approval. He said he felt “horrible” about the situation, but estimated it would cost roughly $50,000 to treat the child.After hearing of the financial issue, a pediatric cancer charity — the Max Cure Foundation — offered to pay for the costs associated with the treatment. A representative for the charity said that Moch still refused and even hung up the phone on him.“I spoke to Mr. Moch yesterday by phone. I told him that we had the $50,000 that I thought he was claiming he needed to supply the drug,” Richard Plotkin, vice chair of the Max Cure Foundation, told Fox News. “He then told me it isn’t about money. He told me it’s all about ethics. I said, ‘Fine, tell me why you will not give [it to] this little boy.’ If he does not get the drug, he will die this week, I’m told. He said he cannot make an exception.”Undeterred, the Hardy parents have turned to social media, in a bid to persuade the drug company to give their son access to the drug.“Our son will die without this drug,” Todd Hardy, Josh’s father, told CNN. “We’re begging them to give it to us.”A “Save Josh” Facebook page has attracted widespread attention, garnering nearly 20,000 likes. Thousands of others have sent tweets to the company, encouraging them to allow access.[blackbirdpie url=”https://twitter.com/_ryanmj/status/443512256563650560″][blackbirdpie url=”https://twitter.com/RovinMom/status/443510565471019009″][blackbirdpie url=”https://twitter.com/kidrauhl_nyc/status/443500351325761536″]At the time of publication, the drug company continued to stand firm on their original position.“If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,” Moch told CNN. “But it’s yes to all or no to all.”—Follow Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) on Twitter[related]Approved posts to MyVoice will be live on the site within a few hours.

133	"UPDATE:  Chimerix has notified St. Jude that it will send the drug that could save 7-year-old Josh Hardy’s life. The company will send brincidofovir within the next 48 hours.St. Jude said in a statement:This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children.  For this reason, it  will be administered under a new treatment protocol as approved by a committee charged with compliance to federal and institutional regulations for clinical research (IRB).  It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation.St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients.  We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts. Previous coverage (Memphis) A 7-year-old St. Jude patient in the intensive care unit battles a virus destroying his heart and kidney.There’s medicine that will likely cure Josh Hardy, but until Tuesday the drug company refused to give it to him, saying that helping Josh would hurt others.Since Josh was 9 months old, he has beat cancer four times.When he got a bone marrow transplant last year, Josh faced another battle – he caught an adenovirus that spread through his body.“He had the bone marrow cells administered January 10. On January 14, we went to the ICU, and we have been there since. He had heart failure, kidney failure and major lung issues,” said his mom Aimee, who remains strong and continues to pray for a miracle.Aimee Hardy said there’s only one experimental drug that’s not approved by the FDA that can likely save him, and St. Jude doctors have requested it several times. The North Carolina drug company, Chimerix, won’t give it to him saying if they help Josh, they won’t be able to get the drug to market in 2016 and save more lives.“They have the opportunity to be a real life superhero for a little 7-year-old, and they’re not they are focused on going to market,” said Aimee Hardy.She said Josh is depressed and worried what’s to come. The only thing he’s looking forward to is his eighth birthday on March 31st.Read more on Josh’s story. For more information: https://www.facebook.com/SaveJoshHardyThe family also started a petition on change.org: http://www.change.org/petitions/chimerix-release-brincidofovir-for-compassionate-use-to-treat-the-adenovirus-plaguing-7-year-old-josh-hardy-right-nowFiled in: News Do you have a story you want KFOR to investigate?

134	"Chimerix, a small and unprofitable biotechnology company, will make an experimental drug available to a young Virginia boy who is suffering from an infection he contracted while being treated for cancer.Chimerix originally said it could not ethically provide the drug to one patient without opening the floodgates to others, presenting it with a huge operational burden that might prevent the drug, brincidofovir, from ever reaching patients. The story of the boy, Joshua Hardy, was shared on CNN, USA Today, The Huffington Post, and generated a large volume of posts on the social networking site Twitter under the hashtag #savejosh. This evening, Chimerix, based in Durham, North Carolina, issued a press release saying that it was going to start a new, 20-patient clinical trial for the treatment of adenovirus (the virus brincidofovir treats) in immunocompromised patients. The first immunocompromised patient, dosed tomorrow morning, will be Josh Hardy.""This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix’s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone,"" said Chimerix Chief Executive Kenneth I. Moch in his company's press release. “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.”Update: In an interview, Moch said that the trial was being planned as the starting phase of a larger study that could eventually lead to the approval of the drug for patients like Hardy. """"The plan and stategy here is a pathway that could lead to approval,"" he says. ""If you look back at everything that we said publicly, it had to be about the many. As much as we cared about a specific individual, it had to be equitable and it had to be associated with the [needs of the] many and that's what we've accomplished here.""
The decision on Chimerix's part could become precedent-setting for the pharmaceutical industry. Usually companies don't make their products available in compassionate use for precisely the reasons Chimerix had stated, as well as others, according to Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. They fear that when a sick patient gets sicker, their drug will be blamed, potentially leading regulators to halt their clinical studies. They worry that patients won't enter clinical trials because with compassionate use, they won't get placebo. Production problems can mean there isn't enough drug to go around. And startup companies that have no profits and a handful of employees say they can't handle the burden of sifting through patients to figure out who should get a medicine and who should not.Just last year, a larger biotechnology firm, Biomarin, came under pressure from an ovarian cancer patient who wanted its drug. The company did not relent, and Sloan died in January. Last year, The New York Times Magazine published a long feature on how dying patients get access to cancer drugs, citing examples where 
 
Novartis
, 
 
Bristol-Myers Squibb
, and 
 
AstraZeneca
 were asked to make medicines available. Sometimes patients got them, and sometimes they didn't.One issue raised by Caplan in a phone conversation yesterday is that it's not ethical to just give a medicine to the person who has the saddest story, or the biggest social media presence. When I emailed him about this announcement, he wrote back that it was a good thing that the FDA and Chimerix had found a way to thread the needle between compassionate use and a clinical trial. But he worried about the consequences.“The fact that this flood of public sentiment pushed this to happen shows that we are now firmly in the age of patient appeals through old and social media,” Caplan wrote me. In a column he writes for MSNBC, he'd written: 'Save Josh, but what about the rest?' A 67-year-old would still be out of luck, and that's not necessarily a fair way to make experimental medicines that may not even work available. He calls for Congress to create a fund to pay for getting experimental medicines to patients, and to change the law to make it easier for that to happen.Tomorrow morning, it's going to be time to think very hard about how our system of getting experimental drugs to patients is broken, and how we fix it. But tonight it's good to know that Josh Hardy will get a medicine that may kill the virus that is spreading in his body. Here's hoping and praying that the drug does what it's supposed to do and that Josh gets to go home."	Health
135	"(CNN) — The Chimerix pharmaceutical company says it will give ailing 7-year-old Josh Hardy a drug that could help him survive as part of a pilot trial.The company said in a statement Tuesday that it had reached an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration to begin a pilot trial with the drug, brincidofovir, and provide it to Hardy as part of that study.The study is expected to start on Wednesday, the statement said.The company had previously denied calls from the 7-year-old’s family to give him the drug, arguing that spending the time to help Josh and others like him will slow down efforts to get the drug on the market.The child’s family and supporters, in online and media campaigns, had been pushing the company to change its mind.The child’s journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body.Now he’s in critical condition in an intensive care unit in Memphis as the virus ravages his body.Editor’s note: The video on this page was produced by our affiliate WREG in Memphis before news broke that Chimerix will supply the experimental drug.

 has encountered this question before regarding Brincidofovir, the drug that the boy’s family seeks to help fight a life-threatening viral infection.On its site, Chimerix says it has received “hundreds” of requests for “compassionate use” of the drug, a situation that it says requires the company to work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It has offered up the drug for patients who have requested it in the past, but only in conjunction with ongoing tests, which are in a lull right now.“Making an experimental drug available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail the approval of that drug,” the company’s Website says. “Providing Brincidofovir in any of these situations, where there is currently limited evidence to suggest that our experimental medicine would be helpful, could very likely place the entire development program at risk.”The company even has an email address set aside for compassionate use requests of Brincidofovir: compassionateuserequest@chimerix.com.Further, it points to a paper from the trade group Biotechnology Industry Organization, which outlines the history of cases like those involving Josh. In its April 2010 paper, the group agrees that early access to program could create a conflict between the needs of a few against those of large patient populations and their need to have the drug approved swiftly.The paper says:  “A patient’s right to treatment based on his or her autonomous decision-making ability does not supersede a company’s ethical responsibility to develop and market safe and effective products as fast as possible.”Spokespersons from Chimerix or Biotechnology Industry Organization did not respond to requests for comment.To recap, Josh has survived four bouts with cancer, but his weakened immune system contracted a life-threatening virus after he underwent a bone-marrow transplant. His parents are pleading with Chimerix to provide Brincidofovir to their boy but the company is reluctant because it has received hundreds of requests for compassionate use of the drug, which would delay development and approval for it. Chimerix says it’s unlikely to gain approval before 2016.Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.Follow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.More health-care news from MarketWatch:President finds a new way to tout Obamacare — trading comic insultsChimerix under pressure to provide dying boy with experimental drugLa Jolla Pharmaceutical shares surge on test resultsHealth Exchange guides investors to the crucial market intelligence they need to keep up with the health care industry, which makes up one-sixth of the U.S. economy.

                    Durham, N.C. — Chimerix, the Durham-based drug company working on experimental medicine that could save the life of a seven-year-old Virginia child, was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to administer the drug to the boy, the company announced Tuesday evening.Seven-year-old Josh Hardy is in the intensive care unit at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., where relatives say he’s trying to fight off a virus contracted while undergoing cancer treatment.Josh’s mother, Aimee, asked the company for a “compassionate dose” of brincidofovir, but the company originally denied the request because doing so could slow down the process of getting the drug to the market, they said.""I know you have your reasons, but this is my child and I don't care what your reasons are,"" she said.Brincidofovir has been in development for nearly 14 years and has ""the potential to become the first broad-spectrum  antiviral for the prevention and treatment of clinically significant  infections and diseases caused by DNA viruses,"" the company said.Chimerix President and CEO Kenneth Moch told WRAL it was ""heartbreaking"" to say no to the initial request.""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating,  and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make,"" he said in a statement.Josh's request became a national story in the media and online. A Facebook page dedicated to his request  has over 21,000 likes.""Thank you to every member of Josh’s Army,""  read a post Tuesday night. ""The world has heard you and because of you  Josh and many others will have the opportunity to receive CMX001  (Brincidofovir) the life saving antiviral drug made by Chimerix.""The post had more than 1,000 likes about 22 minutes after it was posted.The drug was shipped to Memphis and Josh could receive his first dose as soon as Wednesday, said Moch, who added that the company has been working with the FDA all along to find a way to get the drug to Josh and others like him.""Obviously the social media helped accelerate the discussion, but we were in that process already,"" Moch said.The boy's mother and family expressed their thanks to everyone who took part in the social media campaign.""It is completely unbelievable what has transpired since last Thursday,"" she said in a statement. ""(It's) nothing short of a miracle. We are so thankful that Chimerix was able to release the medicine for Josh. The truth of the matter is he is still in the ICU, and we would like to focus on him making a full recovery.""Josh will be the first patient in a pilot trial of the medicine.The FDA allows someone with an immediate life-threatening illness to ask for permission to use experimental drugs that have not yet received the agency’s approval. Last year, the FDA approved 974 such requests, according to CNN.Copyright 2014 by Capitol Broadcasting Company. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.This story is closed for comments.It wasn't the media storm that made this happen, it was the drug company itself. He is NOT get a compassionate dose. They created a new clinical trial to include him and had to get FDA approval for the new trial, so it wouldn't delay the approval process to bring the drug to the market. If the FDA said no, he wouldn't be getting the drug at all.  I'm glad it worked out this way and hope the drug saves that little boy's life.I am aware of the difference between gross and net profits, and while the business may be different from years ago, I am also aware that large profits are still being made.I was so glad to hear this, yesterday evening!  Great news.  Hope it helps.Just wanted to add big kudos for St Jude's Hospital. Fantastic institution that has helped so many children and their families!

                    Yeah if there is nothing nothing gets done and nothing happens right? Maybe there will be more nothing that will explode causing something and that can save the boyMy husband got cancer and was treated with *experimental drugs*....he was the 10 patient at the time that had the rare form of cancer.  The doctors gave him a very slim chance of surviving it.  He had chemo and radiation.  This was 21 years ago.  He lost 95 lbs and looked like *death warmed over*.  Thanks to the *experimental drugs* which allowed him to live.  I hope and pray that this little one will also survive and be blessed with a wonderful and long life.  It is sad that it took so much publicity to get the drugs that might save this child's life.  THANK GOD someone helped him.

                    Very good point.  I wonder how long before this comment has to get pulled.[bbut the drug companies are still reaping large rewards as well. Billions and millions certainly seems like a huge profit to me.][/b]  Know the difference between ""gross profit "" and ""net profit""? Yes, there are several companies that have hit a home run on a particular drug, but most of that money goes back into developing tomorrow's new miracle drug.  The overwhelming majority of drugs in development never see the light of day.  The cost to develop a new drug is astronomical. The success rate is very low. I have been involved with ""big pharma"" for over 20 years. The profits now vs then are vastly different.  Why do you think there have been so many mergers and layoffs over the past few years?LoveMyPirates- Again, I disagree. Yes, there are generics, but there are plenty of new drugs coming out based on the same medication, but with a ""tweak"" here and there to put it back on the market as a brand name medication. Consumers are becoming more aware, but also convinced they need a medication (with no generic equivalent)  because their doctor said so.   Yes, I am sure big energy is big money, but the drug companies are still reaping large rewards as well. Billions and millions certainly seems like a huge profit to me.

                    While I agree with most of your points, you've grossly underestimated a cost of bringing a new drug to market.  Now the average is $5 billion from start to finish for a drug that's approved, and for every drug that's approved, there are many that aren't.  The money lost from drugs that are never approved is in the BILLIONS of dollars.  Kind of scary when you think about it.  The cost of bringing a drug to market is a lot of the reason that these drugs are so expensive once they get there.  It's ridiculous!  ©2018  Capitol Broadcasting Company, Inc."	Health
139	"On Tuesday morning, Chimerix CEO Kenneth Moch was at the center of a media storm, maintaining that there was no way the biotech could responsibly provide its experimental antiviral to a dying child named Josh Hardy, a drug the boy's parents vowed was all that could save the child's life. By Tuesday night, though, Moch had found a way to give the treatment to the 7-year-old after all, as part of the clinical development program for the drug.According to Moch, the FDA has agreed to let Chimerix ($CMRX) immediately launch a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients. Hardy will be the first patient provided the therapy on Wednesday morning. And the company says that regulators have agreed to help design a pivotal Phase III study that could be launched as a continuation of this pilot.A battery of national media groups like CNN, Fox and USA Today churned up a blizzard of stories about Hardy's plight, putting Moch--and his protests that the company couldn't provide the drug under a compassionate use program without triggering hundreds more such demands--under intense scrutiny. But instead of throwing in the towel and simply handing over the therapy, he went for the ""pilot"" compromise to put an end to the controversy.""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make,"" Moch said in a statement. ""It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections,"" Moch says.Moch remains in a tight spot. The company, which is publicly traded, has said it can't commit to a charitable program to give the drug away to desperate patients because it couldn't afford the cost. But the media storm was a public relations disaster, making the company look indifferent to a child's last hope of staying alive. Satisfying its financial responsibilities to stay focused on R&D and gaining public trust about its priorities takes some finesse.  Biotechs, of course, don't design drug studies and recruit patients this way. The boy is extremely sick and may not respond, raising questions about what Chimerix is developing. And what happens when the next compassionate use case hits the headlines? There is a limit to the number of pilot studies that can be launched. But as long as the focus is on this boy and his fate, none of that matters so much. - here's the releaseEditor's Corner: The dying child vs. the biotech: Everybody loses

140	"After multiple news stories, there has been a sudden turn of events that could impact the life of a young boy, as a pharmaceutical company, under new treatment protocols, will be able to make a medicine unapproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration available to him.We first reported on seven-year-old Josh Hardy, on Monday. He has been cancer free for two years, but he's still fighting for his life just shy of his eighth birthday.Despite beating cancer four times, now a rare virus has taken advantage of his compromised immune system, during a life-saving bone marrow transplant.Doctors say beating the virus will require one particular drug called brincidofovir (brenz-a-dof-a-veer). The company Chimerix, which makes the drug, originally said it can't be released outside of controlled clinical trials. On Tuesday, the North Carolina based company Chimerix notified St. Jude that it will send the drug that could save Hardy’s life.The company will send Brincidofovir within the next 48 hours.In a press release Chimerix explained that it reached an agreement with the FDA for the immediate initiation of a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients.""Josh Hardy's story brought to public attention the often-devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix regarding the need for additional clinical development to assess brincidofovir's potential in adenovirus infection,"" the company wrote.The study is expected to begin with Hardy as the first patient enrolled on Wednesday, March 12, 2014.St. Jude, the Memphis hospital where Hardy is being treated, released a statement: This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children. For this reason, it  will be administered under a new treatment protocol as approved by a committee charged with compliance to federal and institutional regulations for clinical research (IRB).  It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation.St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients.  We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.Filed in: News Topics: Chimerix, Josh Hardy Miracles never cease! That CEO would not have been able to sleep if that little boy died. Let’s hope it isn’t too late!And let’s also hope there are no adverse side effects to a drug that is still being experimented onWhy not?  This is what we parents and families of kids with cancer face ALL THE TIME — Initial sympathy and then nothing.  People running for the hills because they can’t deal with what we have to deal with.Please don’t think that you are immune, because you are not.  Imagine how you would feel if this were YOUR grandson.  Fortunately, we have many friends who are much more compassionate and active.Gosh, snogale.  Way to be compassionate!  Please amend your “Don’t plan to have any, any time soon” to “Won’t have any kids.”You really should have gone to school today.I went to school today and had a good and productive day and then I got home and read this amazing news!  Be happy for this young boy and his parents.  Good news!  You should really try to happy for someone, even if it’s not for yourself.He has one, being a troll.  If it makes him/her happy..well, what can ya do?Great news!I don’t know the exact details of the companies original decision, but it appears the possible hangup may have been because it wasn’t approved by the FDA in any way shape or form for anything other than clinical trials. Now the FDA has given them permission. The company and owners may have faced criminal charges for distributing a drug only approved for clinical trials, not to mention possible litigation. While it’s easy to have a gut reaction of anger against the company, in the end it’s the Government Regulations that appear to have held this one back. It seems all they needed was a thumbs up from a Judge, FDA, someone in the Government to authorize this. Had the drug been released and the Government pressed criminal charges, would everyone have been there to stand by the owner during a criminal proceeding? I bet not.Don’t worry about “snogale”.  I’ve had his ignorant and hurtful comments removed.  God bless this family, the FDA, Chimerix, and St. Jude.   I pray he is restored to full health and life soon!Comments are closed.

                    Durham, N.C. — The family of a critically ill Virginia child is putting pressure on a Durham biotech company that is developing a drug they believe could save his life.Seven-year-old Josh Hardy is in the intensive care unit at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., where relatives say he’s trying to fight off a virus contracted while undergoing treatment for cancer.Josh’s mother, Aimee Hardy, has said an experimental drug being developed by Durham-based Chimerix could be her son’s best chance for survival.They have asked the company for what is known as a “compassionate dose” of brincidofovir, but Chimerix has denied the request because doing so could slow down the process of getting the medicine to market.“Making an experimental drug, which currently has limited clinical evidence, available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail our ability make brincidofovir available as soon as possible to the thousands of patients each year who might benefit from it,” Chimerix Chief Executive Ken Moch said in a statement. “ This is why we are focused on demonstrating the safety and efficacy of brincidofovir in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial.”The Food and Drug Administration allows someone with an immediate life-threatening illness to ask for permission to use experimental drugs that have not yet received the agency’s approval. Last year, the FDA agreed to 974 such uses, according to CNN.Moch said the company has received hundreds of requests over the past few years for compassionate use of brincidofovir. The company also pointed to industry-established ethical guidelines that state a patient’s right to treatment does not come before a company’s responsibility “to develop and market safe and effective products as fast as possible.”The Hardy family is undaunted, and they’ve taken their plea around the country. The story has gained a wider audience in recent days following reports by CNN, CBS, Fox News, Huffington Post and USA Today. A Facebook page created for the cause less than a week ago has more than 18,000 “Likes.”""Our son will die without this drug,"" Todd Hardy, Josh's father, said to CNN. ""We're begging them to give it to us.""Copyright 2014 by Capitol Broadcasting Company. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.This story is closed for comments. but meanwhile the adults have to make the real ethical decisions. The hard decisions. TRI1234:Ethical decisions?? don't you mean economic decisions, protecting the investors?? What kind of ethics would deny a 7 year old child a chance to live??I hope he can beat the virus and the cancer but giving him this experimental drug that they have not yet proven to have no serious side effects will not guarente him a healthy life.Shame on Chimerix.  This drug could potentially save this little boys life. Slowing or derailing the ability to make the drug is hogwash.  What if it was a child that belonged to one of the so-called ""decision makers?""  Bet they wouldn't be denied......The charity offered to pay for one photogenic kid with media savvy parents.  Who pays for the next kid?  Who takes responsibility for for the kids who can't get insurance coverage for the drug because approval isn't completed? Pretending this is simpler than it is might make you feel like your halo is on tight, but meanwhile the adults have to make the real ethical decisions.  The hard decisions.If, as the company states, there have been limited clinical trials of the medication--did not reveal how successful or unsuccessful those trials were.  The child, if he receives the medication may well die--but at least the medication will give him a chance.  Without it, the company is condemning this little boy to death.  They have to be lower than whale snot on the bottom of the ocean not to give the boy the chance to live.If you read other articles you will see this greedy drug company HAD ALREADY GIVEN the drug to other people but said it was TOO EXPENSIVE to continue giving it away. A charity has stepped in and said they will pay the $50,000 for this child's treatment. The boy is in ICU in very critical condition and St. Jude Hospital recommended this treatment for their son. Fox News just reported the CEO of the drug company hanging up on the charity offering to pay for the treatment. This is greed defined because it's really about them being afraid to be sued. Good for me, the company is in Durham and I now have a protest I will happily attend.If it wasn't for government bureaucrats, unpredictable government regulations, unpredictable government enforcement of laws (think Eric Holder and his ilk) and lawyers that chase people and convince people to sue, sue, sue THIS would NOT be an issue.We live in a world where everyone wants to legislate safety and stupidity.  We also live in a world where more and more people feel entitled to what others have worked for and EARNED.  When an entitled person gets what they want and has bad results they file lawsuits and or spread BAD publicity.No good deed go unpunished and IF this company were to hand over this drug the unintended consequences would be devastating.  I would NOT do it.Who accepts liability if the company backs down, the drug is administered to Josh, and he (God forbid) dies within 24 hours?  The parents, who were so insistent and took this to the media, or the company, who was reticent for good reason?This may sound harsh but after hearing this on the news with a bit more info, it seems this little boy is very, very sick having survived 3 times. I so understand the parents desire    and no words will give them comfort but it's just not an easy thing regardless. I can so see both sides of this.

142	"A drug company is facing flak for refusing to donate a potentially lifesaving albeit experimental drug to a dying kid. Chimerix, a drug company based in Durham, North Carolina, is receiving unwanted national attention for refusing to donate an antiviral drug called brincidofovir to seven-year old Josh Hardy.Josh was diagnosed with kidney cancer when he was just nine-months old. He also had cancer in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow but he survived all of them. A bone marrow transplant, however, left him with a weak immune system and this raised a concern when doctors found adenovirus spreading throughout his body. Adenovirus is an acute infection that can be fatal for people with a compromised immune system.""Normally, Josh's immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,"" Josh's mother Aimee Hardy wrote on CaringBridge.org. ""The challenge is his immune system can't be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance.""Doctors recommended that Josh receive the oral form of the antiviral drug brincidofovir as it was found effective in clearing up adenovirus in children in as little as one to two weeks. The problem, however, is that drug has not yet been approved by the FDA so the doctors would have to ask for the drug from the company that makes it, Chimerix, Inc. The drug company, however, didn't grant the request.Chimerix used to give brincidofovir to patients who needed the medication in the past but it already stopped the practice. In a statement posted on its website, the company pointed out the implications of making the drug accessible while still in its experimental phase.""Making an experimental drug available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail the approval of that drug,"" Chimerix said. ""Providing brincidofovir in any of these situations, where there is currently limited evidence to suggest that our experimental medicine would be helpful, could very likely place the entire development program at risk.  The successful completion of SUPPRESS is the primary focus and mission of our small company.""In an effort to convince Chimerix to allow Josh to receive the experimental drug under a so-called compassionate use program, in which a seriously ill patient is granted access to an unapproved drug, the Hardy family launched a campaign asking people to help them persuade the company to provide Josh the much needed drug.""Our son will die without this drug,"" said Josh's father, Todd Hardy. ""We're begging them to give it to us.""Chimerix, however, apparently stands firm on its decision. ""We've had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death, and the answer has been no,"" said Chimerix executive Mommeja-Marin.Sign up for our email newsletter today.Tech Times' biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.By clicking on 'Submit' button above, you confirm that you accept Tech Times Terms & ConditionsMedicineAncientEarth/EnvironmentVideo GamesVideo Games

143	"A drug maker decided late Tuesday to send a drug to St. Jude which could save the life of 7-year-old Josh Hardy.The Hardys say the company will send brincidofovir to the hospital Wednesday evening.Aimee Hardy didn't want to leave her son's bedside, but said in a statement:""Please know that we truly appreciate the help you have given us, and we are forever grateful for everyone that took part in the social media campaign. It is completely unbelievable what has transpired since last Thursday. Nothing short of a miracle. We are so thankful that Chimerix was able to release the medicine for Josh. The truth of the matter is he is still in the ICU, and we would like to focus on him making a full recovery.""St. Jude said in a statement:This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children.  For this reason, it  will be administered under a new treatment protocol as approved by a committee charged with compliance to federal and institutional regulations for clinical research (IRB).  It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation.St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients.  We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.(Memphis) A 7-year-old St. Jude patient is in the intensive care unit as a virus destroys his heart and kidney.There's medicine that will likely cure Josh Hardy, but the drug company refuses to give it to him, saying that helping Josh would hurt others.Since Josh was 9 months old, he has beat cancer four times.When he got a bone marrow transplant last year, Josh faced another battle - he caught an adenovirus that spread through his body.""He had the bone marrow cells administered January 10. On January 14, we went to the ICU, and we have been there since. He had heart failure, kidney failure and major lung issues,"" said his mom Aimee, who remains strong and continues to pray for a miracle.Aimee Hardy said there's only one experimental drug that's not approved by the FDA that can likely save him, and St. Jude doctors have requested it several times.The North Carolina drug company, Chimerix, won't give it to him saying if they help Josh, they won't be able to get the drug to market in 2016 and save more lives.""They have the opportunity to be a real life superhero for a little 7-year-old, and they're not they are focused on going to market,"" said Aimee Hardy.She said Josh is depressed and worried what's to come. The only thing he's looking forward to is his eighth birthday on March 31st.""I asked, 'Buddy, what do you want for your birthday?' and he's like, 'To be out of the hospital, to drink whatever I want when I want, and I want and to walk on my own.' The things we all take for granted,"" she said.Josh loves basketball. His favorite player is Lebron James. His dream is to go to the Memphis Grizzlies game on April 9 against Miami Heat.You can keep up with the Josh Hardy on Facebook.The family also started a petition on change.org.Filed in: News Topics: drug, josh hardy, St. Jude THANK GOD …I have been following this story all day and prayed this company would change it’s stance.  I will continue to pray for this little fighter.God is AWESOME. …..get well soon sweet baby.I quote from St Jude’s statememt ..”We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts”… What about Prayers? He’s only 7. He needs GOD and Prayers at this time. Thoughts don’t heal but GOD and Prayer do.I have personally seen God heal, when all the doctors and specialists give up. I pray that God will heal this child, if it is his will.Not everyone believes in fairy tales. What this child needs is medicine and I’m happy he’s going to get it!Prayers for Josh and his family!So much for over the nite deliveryyea they can do overnight..not only over night but express overnightThe dad said his son life is in the president of the drug company hands…no his life is not GOD has thee ulitimate say so not manbull manure…your god may have a hand in it but it’s big pharma that will kill this boy…greed and money, money and greed.I know that not only myself prayed for Josh, his family, and all those involved in making the decision to help the sick child. God is real, he hear our prayer and answerss them. He may not come when we want he but he’s always on time. To God be the Glory.If God has all the power in this, why did God let this child get sick?I think the way they rationalize that is they’ll say God let this child get terminally ill so that once modern medicine has helped him to get better, they can say “O! See the Grace of God and the Wonder of what He has accomplished through our Prayer!” Meantime they’ll still be busy saying vaccinations are the Devil’s work, dinosaur fossils were planted by Satan to make us question our faith, and other complete denials of what science has accomplished for mankind.@ Carlie:  Why do you come to these sites? Is it to be a troll and just stir the pot of dissension? This is about a dying child and grieving parents, not about you and your pathetic negative outlook. If they believe God has a hand in this, just let it be. Take your sarcastic remarks elsewhere.Rhetorical question?@ Jones:  Rhetorical question?Extremely selfish. In sending this medicine, the drug company is now faced with an even bigger problem. Should this drug fail to deliver the desired results and the boy dies, the company will have to report this in their findings, thus making it harder to get FDA approval. That is why the company stated that in helping him, it will hurt others. Will any of you offer this small start-up the money they will lose out on, in attempting to get FDA approval for the masses? I understand, and please don’t bother saying, “Well, what if it was your kid?” If it was my kid and I was faced with this predicament, as so many of you have brought God into this, maybe this would be His will. Thy will be done.Small start-up?? Chimerix is trading at $24.98 with a market capitalization of more than $550 million. Their IPO last year brought almost $120 million directly to their bank account and shares were 1.7% today on this news.@ Carlie:  And your point is what, exactly? That you can find the stock values for the day?@ Nunya:  Selfish? You don’t even know what all has happened here to make this drug available. You are totally off base with you negative, hateful, ignorant remarks. You are also wrong about why this will make it harder to get FDA approval. That is not why they originally denied the request. Read the first article and then make your comments. You may not sound so arrogantly stupid then. And, you didn’t answer your own question “if this were my kid.” And, in case you didn’t know, the $50,000 that the company said they needed to offset the cost to Josh was raised by a non-profit organization. There is a lot more I could explain to you about this, but I really don’t think you care. Your mind was made up without all the facts, idiot troll that you sound like. What the hell is your point?Who cares about a market this is a very beautiful little boy life that needs help if that medicines will make him better give it too God please help this little angle prayers coming your way@ Sonya:  I couldn’t have said it better. Just glad to see a few positive people on this forum. I don’t understand why the negative naysayers even come here and post the way trolls do.My prayers for this little boy..may God be with him during this difficult time!So many of these comments are ridiculous. If you go to these sites to press an agenda, go away. All that needs to be said here is that we hope this boy gets better and we wish all of the strength and love and caring of the world to him and his family to get thru this. They need positive thoughts and support from everyone. If you believe in God, whoever your God may be, pray for him to recover. If you don’t, then hope for him to recover. Either way sends positive thoughts. If you don’t believe in God, do you believe it hurts for others to pray for him? I don’t see how it could hurt. Anything to lift spirits always helps. For those who believe, stop trying to condemn others for their statements just because they don’t meet your approval. St. Jude is a wonderful place. I can’t think of a better place. To come here and see what they are doing and then complain because they asked for thoughts and not prayers seems very petty to me. If you want to add that request for prayers, that’s what the comments are for, but let’s try to keep it positive people. We may never all agree on everything, but I believe we all agree that this boy is fighting a battle that goes beyond what most people could imagine at his age. Lets make sure not to add more battles and just agree to hope he gets better. Be kind to people. Love thy neighbor.This is why I donate to St. Jude as often as I can afford to. What they do for children and their families, I can’t imagine anything more admirable.Well said Felicia, Well said!Comments are closed.Click here to reach us by email or phone

145	Josh Hardy before he underwent a bone marrow transplant in December 2013. (Hardy Family)The parents of 7-year-old cancer survivor Josh Hardy are speaking to the media and urging people to demand that a North Carolina pharmaceutical company provide their son with a potentially life-saving antiviral medication. The family has rallied thousands of people across the country to sign petitions, send Tweets and make phone calls begging Durham-based Chimerax to provide their son with the experimental drug Brincidofovir.After a bone-marrow transplant, Josh’s immune system was ravaged and he developed a viral infection. Now, he’s fighting for his life in a hospital bed at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. His doctor says the medication developed by Chimerix would allow the boy to survive.Brincidofovir is in early development stages and unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA will allow patients who are in life-threatening situations and who tried other medications to ask a pharmaceutical company for an experimental drug. In many cases, companies say yes. “The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013,” according to CNN.But Chimerix president and CEO Kenneth Moch is denying the Hardys’ requesti. Moch says he receives many compassionate use requests, and if he fulfilled Josh’s request he’d have to help others like him, slowing down the drug’s approval process. Moch says the drug is in trials and on track to eventually become available to many people.“We have have great compassion for this family,” Moch says. “But this is not just about a single boy.”The Hardys and their team of supporters aren’t taking no for an answer. They’ve started a Change.org petition and launched a Save Josh Facebook page that has over 18,000 fans.The outpouring and compassion for this child is incredible and Josh’s Mother and Father are the driving force behind it all andAt 9 months old, Josh was diagnosed with a rare cancer that effects only 15 kids a year. As a result of his treatments, he developed a bone marrow disorder and last year he underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. These treatments led to more complications and in January he was admitted to the ICU for heart failure. Five days later he was put on a ventilator. Just when Josh was improving, his body became plagued by an adenovirus and doctors treated him with a medicine that damaged his kidneys. Doctors recommended switching to Brincidofovir, an antiviral drug manufactured by Chimerix that is still in trial form. Other children treated with the drug had their adenovirus clear up within two weeks.Chimerix has denied the Hardy family’s compassionate use request for Brincidofovir because the drug is in phase-three clinical development. Early in the drug’s development, the company responded to these types of requests but two years ago the CEO decided that his 54-person company needed to stop focusing its efforts on compassionate use requests, which typically cost them $50,000 a patient, and move forward full force on earning FDA approval.According to CNN:From 2009 to 2012, the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients, Moch said, but at least at that time, the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along. But currently doctors don’t really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don’t help get the drug to market.Moch says the drug will likely be available in 2016.Moch’s reasoning is logical, but when you’re a parent of a child whose life is on the line, none of this matters. A writer over at the Huffington Post explains why parents will do anything to help their children:Knowing all sides of this case, and even as a biased parent whose daughter lost her life to cancer, when you have the ability to save a child’s life, you do it, no matter what. To me, and many people out there, the answer is simple, if you can afford it or not, if you have to go against your principles or not, whether there are consequences to reputation or not, you do whatever is necessary to save the life of a child.

147	"In an intensive care unit in Memphis, a virus ravages the body of a 7-year-old who’s in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil. In a cabinet in Durham, North Carolina, there’s a drug that could likely help Josh Hardy, but the drug company won’t give it to him. They’re adamant that spending the time to help Josh and others like him will slow down their efforts to get this drug on the market. Helping Josh, they say, means hurting others. When asked how he will feel if Josh dies — and he’s in critical condition, so sadly that could happen soon — the president of the company that makes the drug doesn’t hesitate to answer. “Horrible,” said Kenneth Moch. He would feel horrible and heartbroken. But still, he said there’s no way he’s going to change his mind. There’s no way he’s going to give Josh this drug. ‘We’re begging them’ It’s called “compassionate use,” but sometimes it feels anything but compassionate. Here’s the way it works: According to the Food and Drug Administration, if someone has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they’re still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA. Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013. But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as they did to Josh Hardy. “Our son will die without this drug,” said Todd Hardy, Josh’s father. “We’re begging them to give it to us.” So now, like many families, the Hardys have turned to the media, Facebook, and change.org to pressure the drug company to change its mind. Countless members of “Josh’s army” have responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to “open their hearts,” asking the executives how they can sleep at night. “Everyone is watching,” one tweeter warned the company. Others have tweeted out the e-mail addresses of the company’s board members. Chimerix executives say they’ve received physical threats. Moch, the company president, has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken, but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144-long character debate. At its very simplest, this is it: Chimerix is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone. The company would have to dish out $50,000 per compassionate-use patient, since insurance doesn’t usually pay for experimental drugs, Moch said. And perhaps even more important than the money, it would divert manpower in this 50-person company, since they’d have to handle the requests and then get the patient’s records and follow up with them, as required by the FDA. “If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,” he said. “But it’s yes to all or no to all.” From 2009 to 2012, the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients, Moch said, but at least at that time, the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along. But currently doctors don’t really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don’t help get the drug to market. Beat cancer four times Josh’s journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it. But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body. They gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys. His doctors at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital said not to give up hope. Since they’d been part of the brincidofovir studies, they’d seen how in sometimes just a week or two, the the oral form of the drug could get rid of an adenovirus without damaging the kidneys. Now all they had to do was ask the company that makes brincidofovir: Chimerix, Inc. On February 12, the St. Jude’s doctors called a Chimerix executive, Dr. Marion Morrison, and asked for permission to use brincidofovir. She said no. On March 5, the doctors asked again. Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive, Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company was not “in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources.” ‘He holds our son’s life in his hands’ Moch wants you to know that he has children of his own, and if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh, he’d be doing the same thing as Todd and Aimee Hardy. “There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they’re going through,” he said. Art Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center, said he feels for both the Hardys and for Moch. “We can’t ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out,” he said. It’s not just the $50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish, Caplan said, but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug. Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug. Perhaps there’s another way to handle compassionate use requests, Caplan suggests. Perhaps a company like Chimerix could agree to give the drug only to the very most dire cases, and put a cap on the number of patients they help. “They might want to open the door a little more broadly,” he said. “They might want to show a little compassion.” But right now, Chimerix stands firm that their compassionate use program is almost completely over. “We’ve had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death, and the answer has been no,” said Mommeja-Marin, the Chimerix executive. But that’s not good enough for the Hardys. “He holds our son’s life in his hands,” Todd Hardy said. “This is just beyond belief to me.”Filed in: News Comments are closed.Where do you want to be at kickoff?

								compassionate use							
3.11.14 6:05 PM EST  By Laura Northrup@lnorthrupcompassionate use drugs chimerix brincidofovir antivirals childrenMost people would be appalled to hear that a pharmaceutical company is withholding a potentially life-saving drug from a dying 7-year-old child. The drug isn’t on the market yet, but could be administered under a “compassionate use” exception from the Food and Drug Administration. The situation is a lot more complex than “big mean company keeps drug away from little kid.” Update: Chimerix and the FDA found a way to let Josh Hardy access the drug.  The 7-year-old is currently being treated at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. He’s been seriously ill since he was an infant, eventually going into remission from cancer that began in his kidneys and spread to other parts of his body. He has received a bone marrow transplant, and is critically ill from a virus that people who aren’t on anti-rejection drugs would fight off easily. The drug that he needs to defeat the virus without further destroying his kidneys is the oral form of an antiviral called brincidofovir. The problem is that oral brincidofovir, made by a company called Chimerix, isn’t supposed to go on the market until 2016.Drugs that are still considered “experimental” can go to patients who will die without them: during earlier phases of testing the drug, Chimerix granted hundreds of exceptions. They ended that program, and say that they will not make any more exceptions. One company executive told CNN that even employees’ own family members who could benefit from the drug can’t get it. The company claims that evaluating compassionate use cases and manufacturing the drug for those patients wouldn’t be an effective use of company resources. Chimerix only has fifty employees. They estimate that it costs $50,000 to provide it to one patient, since insurance generally doesn’t cover experimental treatments. Spending staff hours and money on compassionate use cases means that time and money can’t be spent getting the product on the market. The argument from Chimerix effectively is, “If we give the drug to Josh, we’ll have to consider every other patient who could benefit, too.” If the company makes one exception due to a social media campaign, would hundreds of other such campaigns follow? Bioethicist Art Caplan tells CNN that a compromise is possible: the company could consider taking on a limited number of compassionate use cases each year, or limiting them to the most dire cases. Update, 9:30 PM: Chimerix and the FDA have found a way to let the drug be used in this case: they announced a new clinical trial that will begin tomorrow and enroll Josh Hardy as the first subject. The trial will let the company use the drug on future patients with compromised immune systems who are infected with adenoviruses. Company denies drug to dying child [CNN]

150	Josh Hardy, 7, is clinging to life in a hospital room even though medication to help him recover from a curable virus exists. Chimerix, the pharmaceutical company that produces the medicine the young cancer patient needs, put a $50,000 price tag on the life-saving treatment.The family did not have the funds to pay for the expensive medication. Josh’s fate appeared to improve when a charity stepped in and offered to donate the tens of thousands of dollars needed to buy Chimerix, but the drug maker refused to hand over the medication. His doctor’s and family fear that he will not live out the week.Throughout his young life, Josh Hardy has spent many weeks in the hospital. The little boy survived heart failure and four bouts of kidney cancer, according to Fox News. In late November, Josh developed a bone marrow disorder as a result of his ongoing cancer treatments.He underwent both a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. Even though the treatments were a success, Hardy developed the adenovirus. The condition is an acute infection that can be deadly for patients with a compromised immune system.St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital doctors want Josh to be given Brincidofovir – and antiviral drug that has reportedly been proven to eradicate the adenovirus in children in about two weeks. But the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved Brincidofovir, and have reportedly been preventing the young cancer patient from receiving the potentially life-saving medication.Aimee Hardy, Josh’s mother, directly appealed to Chimerix CEO Kenneth Moch, appealing to grant her son emergency access to Brincidofovir. The drug maker has reportedly granted “hundreds” of patient’s emergency access to the medication during the past several years, but now Moch has stopped the practice.According to the Chimerix CEO, the pharmaceutical company “cannot afford” to keep giving away the medication. The Max Cure Foundation, a research organization focusing on rare pediatric cancers, offered to pay Kenneth Moch’s company for the drug multiple times, but they will not budge. When a representative from the foundation asked Moch to picture Josh Hardy as his own son or grandson, the pharmaceutical CEO hung up on the cancer charity officer Richard Plotkin.Plotkin had this to say about his conversation with the Chimerix CEO:“I spoke to Mr. Moch yesterday by phone. I told him that we had the $50,000 that I thought he was claiming he needed to supply the drug. He then told me it isn’t about money. He told me it’s all about ethics. I said, ‘Fine, tell me why you will not give [it to] this little boy.’ If he does not get the drug, he will die this week, I’m told. He said he cannot make an exception.”The “Save Josh” campaign was launched by the boy’s mother online, a hashtag by the same name has been trending on Twitter. Supporters have chartered buses to travel to the Chimreix headquarters to protest the company’s decision to withhold the life-saving drug.[Images Via: Facebook]All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.

152	"MEMPHIS, TN — In an intensive care unit in Memphis, a virus ravages the body of a 7-year-old who’s in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil.In a cabinet in Durham, North Carolina, there’s a drug that could likely help Josh Hardy, but the drug company won’t give it to him. They’re adamant that spending the time to help Josh and others like him will slow down their efforts to get this drug on the market.Helping Josh, they say, means hurting others.When asked how he will feel if Josh dies — and he’s in critical condition, so sadly that could happen soon — the president of the company that makes the drug doesn’t hesitate to answer.“Horrible,” said Kenneth Moch. He would feel horrible and heartbroken.But still, he said there’s no way he’s going to change his mind. There’s no way he’s going to give Josh this drug.‘We’re begging them’It’s called “compassionate use,” but sometimes it feels anything but compassionate.Here’s the way it works: According to the Food and Drug Administration, if someone has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they’re still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA.Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013.But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as they did to Josh Hardy.“Our son will die without this drug,” said Todd Hardy, Josh’s father. “We’re begging them to give it to us.”So now, like many families, the Hardys have turned to the media, Facebook, and change.org to pressure the drug company to change its mind.Countless members of “Josh’s army” have responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to “open their hearts,” asking the executives how they can sleep at night.“Everyone is watching,” one tweeter warned the company. Others have tweeted out the e-mail addresses of the company’s board members. Chimerix executives say they’ve received physical threats.Moch, the company president, has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken, but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144-long character debate.At its very simplest, this is it: Chimerix is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone.The company would have to dish out $50,000 per compassionate-use patient, since insurance doesn’t usually pay for experimental drugs, Moch said. And perhaps even more important than the money, it would divert manpower in this 50-person company, since they’d have to handle the requests and then get the patient’s records and follow up with them, as required by the FDA.“If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,” he said. “But it’s yes to all or no to all.”From 2009 to 2012, the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients, Moch said, but at least at that time, the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along. But currently doctors don’t really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don’t help get the drug to market.Beat cancer four times Josh’s journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body.They gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys.His doctors at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital said not to give up hope. Since they’d been part of the brincidofovir studies, they’d seen how in sometimes just a week or two, the the oral form of the drug could get rid of an adenovirus without damaging the kidneys. Now all they had to do was ask the company that makes brincidofovir: Chimerix, Inc.On February 12, the St. Jude’s doctors called a Chimerix executive, Dr. Marion Morrison, and asked for permission to use brincidofovir. She said no.On March 5, the doctors asked again. Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive, Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company was not “in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources.”‘He holds our son’s life in his hands’Moch wants you to know that he has children of his own, and if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh, he’d be doing the same thing as Todd and Aimee Hardy.“There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they’re going through,” he said.Art Caplan, a bioethicist, said he feels for both the Hardys and for Moch.“We can’t ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out,” he said.It’s not just the $50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish, Caplan said, but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug. Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug.Perhaps there’s another way to handle compassionate use requests, Caplan suggests. Perhaps a company like Chimerix could agree to give the drug only to the very most dire cases, and put a cap on the number of patients they help.“They might want to open the door a little more broadly,” he said. “They might want to show a little compassion.”But right now, Chimerix stands firm that their compassionate use program is almost completely over.“We’ve had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death, and the answer has been no,” said Mommeja-Marin, the Chimerix executive.But that’s not good enough for the Hardys.“He holds our son’s life in his hands,” Todd Hardy said. “This is just beyond belief to me.”By Elizabeth Cohen, Senior Medical CorrespondentCNN’s John Bonifield, Nadia Kounang and intern Arianna Yanes contributed to this report. Filed in: News The company is not denying Josh the drug because it’s evil or because of money – it’s denying because providing the drug would likely delay FDA approval by months or years. The federal government Chimirex $72M to run a CLINICAL TRIAL — which does NOT require it (or any other pharmaceutical company) to distribute an unapproved drug on a “compassionate use” basis.Do you know WHY there are stringent laws/regulations governing clinical trials? Because 1) it ensures that drugs are safe before doctors are allowed to prescribe them and 2) stops horrors like the infamous Tuskegee Experiment from EVER happening again.  The laws/regs are NEEDED.Last but not least, there are multiple stages to a clinical trial – in this particular case, the FDA has deemed it safe (Phase 1), effective relative to placebo (Phase 2) and is in the process of confirming it to be safe/effective (Phase 3).  The drug was NOT designed to fight the type of infection little Josh is battling, so if he got the drug and had an adverse reaction for any reason (e.g. so sick that he died anyways, reacts badly with the other drugs he’s taken, etc), Chimirex is required to report it to the FDA, which will delay FDA approval by months or years while the reason for the adverse effect is investigated.My heart goes out to Josh and his family – but the drug company is making the RIGHT call by refusing to give him the drug.Comments are closed.Watch our newscasts from the comfort of your phone or computer 24/7.

	                        	 ((Chimerix/Aimee Hardy))
	                        
	                    A pediatric cancer charity is offering to pay for 7-year-old cancer survivor Josh Hardy to receive lifesaving medication that could cure him of a potentially deadly virus.But Chimerix, the pharmaceutical company that produces the medication, is still refusing to give Josh the treatment he so desperately needs.  In fact, a representative for the charity said he tried speaking with Chimerix CEO Kenneth Moch about Josh's case - but Moch hung up on him.Over the course of his childhood, Josh has survived four bouts of kidney cancer and even suffered from heart failure.  Then, in November 2013, he developed a bone marrow disorder as a result of his cancer treatments and underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Though his treatments were a success, Josh subsequently developed adenovirus – an acute infection that can be deadly in people with compromised immune systems.Doctors at St. Jude recommended that Josh be treated with Brincidofovir – an antiviral drug that has been proven to clear up adenovirus in children within two weeks.  However, the drug has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), preventing Josh’s family from gaining access to the medication.Josh’s mother, Aimee Hardy, has appealed to Moch to grant Josh emergency access to the medication, but the company is refusing to make an exception.  According to Fox News’ Peter Johnson Jr., Chimerix has given hundreds of patients emergency access to Brincidofovir in the past, but Moch said the company has since stopped this practice because “they cannot afford it.”Now, the Max Cure Foundation, a charity dedicated to researching rare pediatric cancers, has offered to pay for the cost of the drug – but Chimerix still won’t budge.“I spoke to Mr. Moch yesterday by phone.  I told him that we had the $50,000 that I thought he was claiming he needed to supply the drug,” Richard Plotkin, vice chair of the Max Cure Foundation, told Johnson Jr. on Fox and Friends.  “He then told me it isn’t about money.  He told me it’s all about ethics.  I said, ‘Fine, tell me why you will not give [it to] this little boy.’ If he does not get the drug, he will die this week, I’m told.  He said he cannot make an exception.”Through a grassroots campaign launched by Josh’s mother, Chimerix has received hundreds of phone calls and emails in support of Josh, and the hashtag #savejosh has been trending on Twitter.  Supporters have even started chartering buses so they can protest at the company’s headquarters.Although support for Josh is strong, Hardy says her son is running out of time.“It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him,” Hardy told Fox News. “But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery.”Plotkin asked Moch if he would react differently if Josh was his child or grandchild, but Plotkin said Moch refused to answer and hung up the phone.“As a result, it appears the final plea is to the board of directors at Chimerix…I ask the board to close their eyes, and as you close your eyes, assume there’s a little boy lying in a hospital bed who says to his father, ‘Daddy, am I going to die? And if I’m going to die, who will take care of me in heaven?’” Plotkin said. “And then I want you to assume that this little boy is your child or grandchild. And members of the board of directors, I have no doubt how you would respond to that.”View AllThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

155	"A North Carolina pharmaceutical company is being bombarded by appeals on behalf of a critically ill 7-year-old boy who needs an experimental drug made by the firm.His family and doctors say he needs brincidofovir, a medication being tested by Chimerix, a small Durham, N.C., drug company. The drug has been proven to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, Fox News.com reported.But the company has turned down the family's request to supply the drug. So Josh's parents, Todd and Aimee Hardy of Fredericksburg, Va., have appeared on television news shows and taken to social media, asking viewers to contact Chimerix on their son's behalf. Their Joshua Hardy page on Caringbridge.com has received nearly 121,000 visits and the family's Save Josh Hardy Facebook page had more than 16,000 ""likes"" as of mid-morning Tuesday.The Hardys are asking supporters to call Chimerix at 919-806-1074;  e-mail compassionateuserequest@chimerix.com or tweet @chimerix using the hashtag #savejosh, Fox said. A petition also has been started at change.org.""I want to be by his bedside, holding his hand, telling him, 'It's going to be OK,' but because of this unwillingness to release this drug, I have to leave him and come talk to you and it infuriates me,"" Aimee Hardy told Fox and Friends interviewer Peter Johnson Jr. during a broadcast Monday.""Our son will die without this drug,"" Todd Hardy told CNN. ""We're begging them to give it to us.""Aimee Hardy also spoke with CNN:
Josh has been battling serious illness much of his life, surviving kidney cancer and heart failure, according to Fox News. He contracted the adenovirus in January after receiving chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant to treat a bone marrow disorder. Although brincidofovir (pronounced brin-sih-DOH-fo-vir) hasn't received Food and Drug Administration approval, Chimerix (KY-mir-ix) could supply it under ""compassionate use,"" a policy under which experimental drugs can be used if a patient's life is threatened and other treatments have failed, CNN said.The company has turned down the request, despite ""thousands"" of emails, calls and other communications it has received on Josh's behalf, Chimerix President Kenneth Moch told USA Today. If he granted the Hardys' request, he said, he'd have to say yes to many other patients in the same straits. That would drain Chimerix of the resources the company needs to complete a formal study, win FDA approval and eventually help many others, he said.""We have have great compassion for this family,"" Moch said. ""But this is not just about a single boy.""The company receives many compassionate use requests for brincidofovir, Moch said. It can only grant them for people who took it in a previous trial and for newborns being treated for herpes simplex virus, the subject of a new trial of the drug. Chimerix also would supply it in case of a bioterrorist-caused smallpox outbreak, he said.Josh doesn't meet those criteria and the company currently is not studying brincidofovir's application to children with his infection. Moch said.Medical ethicist Arthur Caplan, who teaches at New York University Langone Medical Center, said he sympathizes with the Hardys and Chimerix. While the family is seeking treatment for their child, fulfilling compassion care requests drains small drug companies of staff time and money they need to bring a medicine to market, he said. It also exposes the company to risk should a patient be harmed by taking an experimental drug outside a clinical trial, Caplan told USA Today.Do you think Chimerix is justified in withholding brincidofovir or should it release it to treat Josh Hardy?

156	"How to Live Better, LongerBehavior, Neuroscience & Your BrainTechnology & the Business of MedicineHealthcare, Policy & GovernanceBreaking News and TrendsScience is Stranger Than FictionA 7-year-old boy from Virginia is fighting for his life from his St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital bed in Tennessee, shortly after beating cancer four times since the age of 1. The four-time kidney cancer survivor, Josh Hardy, developed a viral infection — adenovirus — after undergoing a bone marrow transplant in November 2013 for myelodysplastic syndrome, a precancerous bone marrow disorder. After complete heart failure and kidney failure followed the transplant, the need for antiviral medicine became apparent — a life-saving drug a North Carolina pharmaceutical company, Chimerex, is not willing to give.   Josh Hardy surrounded by his family at the hospital, and outside. SaveJoshHardy/Facebook.com  ""Having survived four diagnoses of cancer, it would be an absolute travesty for him to meet his demise from a virus,"" said his mother, Aimee Hardy, to ABC News. ""Especially knowing there is a medicine in someone’s hands that can rid of this virus."" The drug, brincidofovir, manufactured by Chimerex, has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks.The doctors at St. Jude’s gave Josh antiviral medicine to get rid of the adenovirus he developed after his heart and kidneys began to heal. However, the drug was toxic to the boy’s kidneys, and it wasn’t working. As an alternative, the team of doctors suggested brincidofovir, because they tried it in children in a previous study. ""Our doctor said 'This drug will cure and save your son,'"" said Josh’s father, Todd Hardy.Chimerex President and CEO Kenneth Moch, aware that Josh’s life is in his hands, simply said they “can’t afford” to take that risk. The drug company has previously given patients emergency access to medication, but they stopped doing so since it was costly, despite receiving $72 million in federal funding to develop brincidofovir. Moch believes saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to more patients, and therefore, drowning the company’s resources and delaying FDA approval that would help a greater number of patients. ""We all have great compassion for this child,"" Moch said to ABC News. ""We spent our lives trying to develop new medications for patients just like Josh. ... We need to make sure to get this drug available as soon as possible to as many people as possible.""The company participates in compassionate use — the use of medications that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration but are in the earlier stages of development. The FDA only allows companies to provide drugs to some patients under certain circumstances. Currently, Chimerex can only give drug approval to patients who have been on the drug in a previous trial and newborns with herpes simplex virus. Josh does not meet either of the criteria.   Josh surrounded by his family outside. SaveJoshHardy/Facebook.com  “It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him. But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery,” Aimee told Fox News. Brincidofovir has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity against all five families of viruses that affect humans, including the adenovirus, and has no evidence of kidney or bone marrow toxicity, according to Chimerex’s website. The adenovirus, although similar to the common cold, can lead to mild and serious complications, such as damage in the eyes, GI tract, bladder, and most notably, a lung problem like acute respiratory distress syndrome, which could be fatal.   The Hardy family has taken to social media to petition for the release of brincidofovir – the drug that can cure adenovirus – Josh's condition.  SaveJoshHardy/Facebook.com  Despite Chimerex’s “no,” the Hardys, just like their son, will fight this through and not take “no” for an answer. The family has started to use social media to ask supporters to call (919) 806-1074, email compassionateuserequest@chimerix.com, or tweet Chimerex @chimerex using the hashtag #savejosh. They can even track Josh’s progress via the Save Josh Facebook page. To make a donation to Josh, supporters can also visit his CaringBridge page and have the opportunity to see photos of Josh, and sign the guestbook.

157	"MEMPHIS, Tennessee -- Josh Hardy has already fought off cancer four times in his precious few years of life.Now, the 7-year-old is fighting a deadly adenovirus, and his parents are pleading for help from a drug company that makes an experimental medication that could save his life.CNN reports that North Carolina-based Chimerix has denied the family the antiviral drug brincidofovir, which they requested under the ""compassionate use"" policy. According to the Food and Drug Administration, compassionate use comes into play when a person has a serious or life-threatening condition and, because other available treatments have failed, they ask a drug company for an experimental drug not yet approved by the FDA.Sometimes, drug companies say yes. Sometimes, they say no. Kenneth Moch, president of Chimerix, said allowing the Hardy family, or others, to use brincidofovir right now would hinder efforts to get the drug on the market by the end of 2016. It would cost the company $50,000 per patient and divert manpower in the small company, he said. ""If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,"" Moch told CNN. ""But it's yes to all or no to all.""[Click here to read the entire story from CNN.]The Hardy family has taken to the media, Facebook and other social media -- including a Change.org petition -- to pressure the company into a change of heart.

Such practice is called compassionate use of an experimental drug, still being tested in the lab and not yet approved by FDA.In 2013 FDA approved 974 compassionate use of such drugs.Manufacturing companies often say yes, but also say no and in the case of Josh, the drug is not being given.“Our son will die without this drug,” Todd Hardy, Josh’s father told CNN. “We’re begging them to give it to us.”The Hardy’s have now turned to social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter for help from the general public. Many concerned are asking Chimerix to relent and give Josh the life-saving drug.Countless members of “Josh’s army” have responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to “open their hearts,” asking the executives how they can sleep at night. One angry tweet read,“everyone is watching.”Others have begun sending mails to board members. Chimerix executives say they have also received death threats.Moch says he has read the tweets and is heartbroken, but the situation they are in, may not possibly be explained using twitter.In simple terms he explains, “Chimerix is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone.”For compassionate use cases, the company would have to spend $50,000 per case as experimental drugs are not covered under insurance. More importantly is that the 50 person company would have to divert man power to handle the requests and then get the patient’s records and follow up with them, as required by the FDA.“If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,” he said. “But it’s yes to all or no to all.”But it is not that this particular drug was not given earlier for compassionate use.Between 2009 and 2012 the company gave the drug to 451 patients but in those cases the use on patients was beneficialfor the Chimerix study. Currently the patient use is not helping the science go forward and therefore compassionate use has no purpose in speeding the process of getting the drug to the market.Meanwhile, Josh struggles to stay alive every day. He was 9 months old when he was first diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But after a bone marrow transplant Josh’s immune system weakened and last year doctors detected an infection of adenovirus spreading in his body.They gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys.Doctors at the St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital had been part of the study of this particular drug and assured the family that if the intravenous dosage had failed, the one given orally could be given without damaging the kidneys. They proceeded to ask the manufacturers Chimerix Inc. to use the experimental drug.On February 12, the St. Jude’s doctors called a Chimerix executive, Dr. Marion Morrison, and asked for permission to use brincidofovir. She said no.On March 5 they asked again.  Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive, Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company was not “in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources.”‘He holds our son’s life in his hands’ said the family.On the other hand Moch says that he is a father himself and would have done the same thing to save his son’s life if he had been going through the same situation.“There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they’re going through,” he said.Art Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center told CNN there are many reasons why a company might say no to giving a drug for compassionate use.“We can’t ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out,” he said.He also adds that apart from the huge amount of $50,000 that investors might have to pay, compassionate case might make a drug look bad as the patient is already quite sick and the drug may make it worse. The manufacturing companies need to report back to FDA regarding the usage of the drugs and the poor outcome may go negatively in the future marketing of the drug.Caplan suggests that Chimerix may still give the drug to Josh by giving the drug only in very dire cases and limiting the number of times they give it for compassionate use.“They might want to open the door a little more broadly,” he said. “They might want to show a little compassion.”But at present the company’s stand is a firm no.“We’ve had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death, and the answer has been no,” said Mommeja-Marin, the Chimerix executive.The Hardys can’t believe the crossroads they are in.“He holds our son’s life in his hands,” Todd Hardy said. “This is just beyond belief to me.”At one end it is hard to believe that a company would go to such an extent to deny a child the only chance to live, on the other hand it also seems valid that the present no is a way to ensure that more like Josh are saved in future. But somehow, in the quest to mass market a life-saving drug, the manufacturer seem to have forgotten the basic essence of creating such drugs – to save lives no matter what. Josh is one life that needs saving now.SOURCEAtula is a writer, traveler and a nature-lover. She is also mom to a boy who seems to have inherited all her creative genes.

160	"Photo courtesy of CNN.Photo courtesy of CNN.CNN – In an intensive care unit in Memphis, a virus ravages the body of a 7-year-old who’s in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil.In a cabinet in Durham, North Carolina, there’s a drug that could likely help Josh Hardy, but the drug company won’t give it to him. They’re adamant that spending the time to help Josh and others like him will slow down their efforts to get this drug on the market.Helping Josh, they say, means hurting others.When asked how he will feel if Josh dies — and he’s in critical condition, so sadly that could happen soon — the president of the company that makes the drug doesn’t hesitate to answer.“Horrible,” said Kenneth Moch. He would feel horrible and heartbroken.But still, he said there’s no way he’s going to change his mind. There’s no way he’s going to give Josh this drug.‘We’re begging them’It’s called “compassionate use,” but sometimes it feels anything but compassionate.Here’s the way it works: According to the Food and Drug Administration, if someone has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they’re still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA.Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013.But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as they did to Josh Hardy.“Our son will die without this drug,” said Todd Hardy, Josh’s father. “We’re begging them to give it to us.”So now, like many families, the Hardys have turned to the media, Facebook, and change.org to pressure the drug company to change its mind.Countless members of “Josh’s army” have responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to “open their hearts,” asking the executives how they can sleep at night.“Everyone is watching,” one tweeter warned the company. Others have tweeted out the e-mail addresses of the company’s board members. Chimerix executives say they’ve received physical threats.Moch, the company president, has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken, but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144-long character debate.At its very simplest, this is it: Chimerix is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone.The company would have to dish out $50,000 per compassionate-use patient, since insurance doesn’t usually pay for experimental drugs, Moch said. And perhaps even more important than the money, it would divert manpower in this 50-person company, since they’d have to handle the requests and then get the patient’s records and follow up with them, as required by the FDA.“If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,” he said. “But it’s yes to all or no to all.”From 2009 to 2012, the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients, Moch said, but at least at that time, the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along. But currently doctors don’t really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don’t help get the drug to market.Beat cancer four timesJosh’s journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body.They gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys.His doctors at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital said not to give up hope. Since they’d been part of the brincidofovir studies, they’d seen how in sometimes just a week or two, the the oral form of the drug could get rid of an adenovirus without damaging the kidneys. Now all they had to do was ask the company that makes brincidofovir: Chimerix, Inc.On February 12, the St. Jude’s doctors called a Chimerix executive, Dr. Marion Morrison, and asked for permission to use brincidofovir. She said no.On March 5, the doctors asked again. Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive, Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company was not “in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources.”‘He holds our son’s life in his hands’Moch wants you to know that he has children of his own, and if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh, he’d be doing the same thing as Todd and Aimee Hardy.“There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they’re going through,” he said.Art Caplan, a bioethicist, said he feels for both the Hardys and for Moch.“We can’t ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out,” he said.It’s not just the $50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish, Caplan said, but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug. Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug.Perhaps there’s another way to handle compassionate use requests, Caplan suggests. Perhaps a company like Chimerix could agree to give the drug only to the very most dire cases, and put a cap on the number of patients they help.“They might want to open the door a little more broadly,” he said. “They might want to show a little compassion.”But right now, Chimerix stands firm that their compassionate use program is almost completely over.“We’ve had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death, and the answer has been no,” said Mommeja-Marin, the Chimerix executive.But that’s not good enough for the Hardys.“He holds our son’s life in his hands,” Todd Hardy said. “This is just beyond belief to me.”Photo courtesy of CNN.Filed in: News All I have to say is to the company that won’t give josh the drug is this: how would you feel if it was your child? Think about putting yourselves in these parents and poor child’s shoes. He needs this medication and you denying him it is denying him the right to live and be a child. Grow some and man up and help this family there are more import things then advertising the drug to the public when you can save ones life now same one now many will fallow if it is a useful drug word travels faster by mouth then your stupid media commercials give this boy a chance to live again make the parents and his family happy by doing this you make a lot of people happy and you will feel good about yourselve don’t be a mean human save the life of this poor Little boy .Surely some rich person can donate $50,000 or more to try to persuade this company to try to give this child another chance.Someone needs to tell Ellen she would pay it.Update: The drug company has agreed to furnish the child with the medication even without  FDA approval.Comments are closed.Check the latest 5NEWS adventure.

An obscure Durham drug company is facing a barrage of unwanted national attention for refusing to donate potentially lifesaving drugs to a 7-year-old boy who is gravely ill.Chimerix, a company with no products on the market, has spent the past 13 years developing a virus-killing drug that’s now desperately sought by the family of Josh Hardy, an ailing first-grader from Fredericksburg, Va. Josh, a four-time cancer survivor, lies hospitalized with a potentially fatal adenovirus that colonized in his 46-pound body after a bone-marrow transplant.“They keep giving him medicine, and he keeps getting worse,” said Todd Hardy, the boy’s father. Chimerix’s experimental drug is so promising that the federal government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is backing the company’s work to develop the drug as a weapon against bioterrorism. Chimerix raised $118 million in April in a stock offering on the drug’s promise. The drug – called Brincidofovir (CMX001) – is not expected to win regulatory approval for public use until late 2016 at the earliest, and Chimerix has not said how much it might cost per dose.Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access.The Hardy family’s hope stems from Chimerix’s history of distributing the medication to 430 patients between 2009 and 2012. Chimerix cut off its “compassionate care” program as the drug entered advanced stages of development and testing.Since then Chimerix has turned away hundreds of requests from ill patients, said Chimerix CEO Kenneth Moch. He said that testing drugs on patients requires some patients to take placebos, and it would be difficult to attract patients to a drug study in which seriously ill people might end up taking a useless sugar pill when they could get the drug they need in a competing program.Getting the drug approved – to where it would be widely available and covered by insurance – must be a drug developer’s priority, even if it means turning down requests from people who need the drug, Moch said.“This is an ethical dilemma of substance,” Moch said. “We are heartstricken about this child.”In medicine’s endgame of dwindling treatment options, requests like the Hardys’ are not unusual, but until recently such negotiations between doctors and drug developers played out in private. Today, desperate families are seizing control and occasionally turning to social media to apply intense pressure when startup drug companies reject a request that doesn’t meet ethics guidelines or medical standards.Todd Hardy said he made a personal appeal to Moch by phone but said his legions of supporters will go over the CEO’s head.“Basically, he reads off a card,” Hardy said. “We’re going after the board of directors.” Protest plannedThe Hardy family – which has been featured in national TV interviews on Fox and CNN and was one of Monday’s top trending topics on Twitter – is organizing a caravan to roll into North Carolina on Thursday. The family intends to stage a televised protest at the headquarters of the 54-employee company with the goal of breaking the drug maker’s corporate will.“This is the first time people have tried to use this kind of pressure,” Moch said. “If we were to make this drug available for Josh Hardy, then others could make the same request. Could we say ‘no’ to them? Wouldn’t they start a similar campaign?”In a similar campaign, Texas legal aid attorney Andrea Sloan launched a social media blitz last year to obtain experimental drugs to treat her ovarian cancer. Her online petition included support from Wynonna Judd, Rosie O’Donnell and Mia Farrow. The drugmaker, California’s BioMarin, did not offer the medication but Sloan succeeded in getting unproven drugs from another drugmaker. She did not survive her illness.The Hardy family is requesting Chimerix’s anti-viral under an established “compassionate care” practice in which pharmaceutical companies distribute medications that are still under development to seriously ill patients who have run out of treatment options. The program carries the risk that unproven medicines may prove ineffective or cause dangerous side effects.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration can grant such an emergency approval in less than a day in urgent cases and approved 974 “compassionate care” requests of 977 submitted in the 2013 fiscal year. To qualify a patient has to have a serious or life-threatening disease with no treatment alternatives.Drugmakers are not required to offer “compassionate care” medications, but those that do typically establish guidelines to make sure the program meets biomedical ethics standards. For Chimerix, that means that the free drugs have to be offered to everyone who qualifies, Moch said.Multinational companies have strict rules about when and how they dispense drugs before they’re approved by regulators.“Compassionate use involves unidentified risk and may create a false sense of hope in patients,” according to standards set by the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical firm. “Compassionate use also can negatively impact the operations of new or ongoing clinical studies ... and subsequently delay the approval of a new medication.”Chimerix said that Brincidofovir is available under limited circumstances and only a handful of patients are using the drug. Qualifying patients are those who have previously tested the drug in clinical trails, are infected with pox viruses,  or are newborns who suffer from a herpes simplex virus.  Effectiveness unclearThe Hardy family’s request was submitted to Chimerix last week by the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., which tested the antiviral drug on 48 patients two years ago and is familiar with its attributes. In the request, Victor Santana, St. Jude’s vice president, told Chimerix that the boy is fighting for his life and “it is likely that after having fought off against childhood cancer for so long, he may succumb to this infection.”Josh Hardy was diagnosed with Stage 5 renal cancer at 9 months of age and has been in and out of hospitals when he wasn’t healthy and playing on baseball, basketball and lacrosse teams, his father said. He’s had cancer of the lungs and of the thymus and most recently was stricken with leukemia. He is being treated for renal failure; because his immune system is compromised, Josh was infected with adenovirus about three weeks ago.The infection itself raises another complication with Brincidofovir because the antiviral was designed to prevent infections, not to treat them. For that reason it’s not clear if the drug would help Josh, Moch said. The St. Jude’s clinical trial was conducted on patients with early infections of adenovirus, and the results were not statistically significant, but they showed no side effects, clearing the way for further study. The current trial, using 450 patients, began in September and will continue into 2015, but it’s designed to measure the prevention of a similar virus, not adenovirus. Arthur Caplan, head of the medical ethics division of the NYU Langone Medical Center, said companies like Chimerix are in an impossible position. Yielding to public appeals could undermine the development of experimental drugs and skew a health care system that already favors some over others. “Josh has savvy parents. Josh is kind of cute. Josh has a puppy. Josh has a media campaign,” Caplan said. “But the next Josh may not have any of this.”

    Small biotech firm Chimerix Inc. is under increasing pressure to help a dying 7-year-old boy with an experimental drug, but is reluctant because doing so will hamper the company’s efforts to get it to market in a timely fashion.A report from CNN late Monday (click on video above)  told the story of Josh Hardy, a first-grader from Fredericksburg, Va., who has survived four bouts with cancer. Now, however, a bone-marrow transplant made him susceptible to a potentially fatal adenovirus, and he’s struggling for survival in a Memphis hospital.Doctors think Chimerix’s

 Brincidofovir, a drug now in the testing stage, could help the child but the company needs to go through an elaborate process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to get the drug to him under the FDA’s “compassionate use” guidelines. Companies are allowed to offer experimental drugs for compassionate use if patients have no other recourse.Chimerix officials, however, say they can’t spare the manpower needed at their 50-person company based in Durham, N.C., in order to properly process a compassionate use case and are concerned it would open the floodgates for many more such requests. Complying with these requests, company officials told CNN and other news agencies, would hamper its ability to get the drug to market. Brincidofovir is not expected to be approved for sale until at least 2016.Chimerix Chief Executive Kenneth Moch says he would feel “horrible” if Josh were to die, but says if he helps the boy, it could hamper his ability to help many more patients down the road.The company has granted compassionate use requests in the past for Brincidofovir, but that was in connection with testing programs conducted from 2009 to 2012. CNN reports the cost of treatment is roughly $50,000 per patient and is not covered by insurance.Josh’s family is turning to the media and other sources to try and get Chimerix to relent. Protests are planned. Further, company executives say they are receiving death threats in connection with the case.Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.Follow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.More health-care news from MarketWatch:La Jolla Pharmaceutical shares surge on test resultsInmates get Obamacare via MedicaidExtension on older policies is “credit negative” for insurers: Moody’sHealth Exchange guides investors to the crucial market intelligence they need to keep up with the health care industry, which makes up one-sixth of the U.S. economy.

163	"The pharmaceutical company Chimerix said Tuesday that Josh would receive medicine that doctors hope will help him as part of a pilot trial of the drug brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infections in certain patients. Josh got his first dose of the drug on Wednesday.
The story of 7-year-old Josh Hardy has brought to light the issue of “compassionate use” of experimental drugs and the willingness of drug companies to provide them.The pharmaceutical company Chimerix said Tuesday that Josh would receive medicine that doctors hope will help him as part of a pilot trial of the drug brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infections in certain patients. Josh got his first dose of the drug on Wednesday.The boy has been battling cancer since he was 9 months old and recently received a bone marrow transplant at St. Jude’s in Memphis. In the days leading up to the new treatment, Josh has been in the ICU ravaged by a virus. His heart and kidneys are failing him.“Josh has a long road to recovery,” Todd Hardy, Josh’s father, told CNN in an e-mail Thursday.In a campaign that went viral, the parents pleaded with the pharmaceutical company Chimerix to provide a compassionate dose of brincidofovir for Josh. Chimerix initially rejected the request.Chimerix  CEO Kenneth Moch had said that if the company spends too much time and money on “compassionate use” cases it would greatly hinder its effort to get brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone. But the company changed course in the wake of the publicity the Josh Hardy case had generated.“Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections,” Moch said as part of a statement on the final decision to provide the drug.If someone faces a life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug. These drugs are usually still under review and have yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Sometimes the drug companies say yes. According to CNN, 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013 were approved.With every “compassionate use” arrangement a drug company approves, the longer it takes to get a drug out to the general public.The FDA says that if someone has a life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they’re still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA.You can visit the “Save Josh” Facebook page.

165	"Anyone in the industry who knows Ken Moch, the CEO of a little biotech in Durham, NC, named Chimerix, is likely to describe him as personable, chronically cheerful and an outspoken champion of all things Chimerix ($CMRX).Today, though, to anyone who listens to the mainstream media, Moch is a villain. He's the head of a company that ""denies drug to dying child"" (CNN) and ""refuses to give life-saving medication to 7-year-old boy"" (Fox News) as ""thousands beg company"" to fork it over (Detroit Free Press). He and his staff are getting death threats.There are plenty more juicy headlines to pick from. Big media groups can really rack up audience traffic when they can profile a dying child and his desperate parents' fight against a drug company; even if the ""drug company"" in question doesn't have any products, works with a small staff of 54 and is trying its best to get an approval so it can start making some money.Chimerix is doing this on a budget, mind you, that is as far from the Big Pharma world as your local bank is from Wall Street. In the last quarter the biotech lost $8.2 million as it worked on an experimental therapy for lethal viral infections dubbed brincidofovir (CMX001).Josh Hardy, the 7-year-old kid at the heart of this story, is impossible not to like. He's been fighting cancer for years and now his parents say that his only chance of surviving the virus that threatens his life is with Chimerix's experimental, unapproved therapy.The problem for Chimerix, as Moch has been trying to explain, is that if they give the drug to Hardy, they'd have to set up a program for hundreds of more such patients. And they would have to pay for this philanthropic program and administer it while they're working on clinical trials. But reason isn't going to make a dent in public opinion. Not when you have a dying child in the story. But this situation occurs too often for biotechs, which inevitably come out looking like hard-hearted corporations putting profits ahead of lives.I routinely get emails looking for some back door to a clinical trial or advice on obtaining a Phase III therapy. Occasionally, desperate patients hire PR firms to take their cases public. But Chimerix and the other biotechs that find themselves in the spotlight aren't the villains. Caught between a rock and a hard place, biotechs can't sacrifice common sense or veer from their development path. The best they can do is finish their work as quickly as possible, so doctors and patients will know for certain whether the product they've been developing can actually help.That's the business model this country and much of the world depends on for developing new drugs. It may be deeply flawed, but it cannot be ignored by a company like Chimerix or any other small biotech.Perhaps there is some other way for biotechs to handle compassionate use programs. Perhaps the bigger CROs, industry leaders and regulators could coordinate a compassionate use program for the most needy patients that could be paid for from multiple sources. But the heat needs to come off the small biotechs. They follow a risky enough path as it is. Suddenly being confronted with a phalanx of cable news shows and USA Today and other major news groups which feed on raw emotion shouldn't be one of the threats they face. -- John Carroll, editor-in-chief (email | Twitter)Editor's Note: As we reported Tuesday night, Chimerix came up with a special pilot study that planned to treat Josh Hardy Wednesday morning, saying the FDA was open to expanding it into a Phase III trial at a later date. Also, USA Today's writer, Kim Painter, contacted us to say she felt that this piece unfairly lumped her story--""Thousands beg company....""--in with the cable news reports. To be fair, she included comments from the CEO as well as a bioethicist who sympathized with the company's position, pointing out some of the complexities of this case. It was the lurid headline that attracted my attention primarily, perhaps unfairly, to the writer. Stories are more than a headline, as I often point out to my own critics.

168	"Chimerix, Inc. has refused to administer an antiviral drug called, brincidofovir, to a dying seven-year old boy despite pressure from thousands of protestors. The company reasoned it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Josh Hardy is a cancer survivor with a life-threatening viral illness that he got after a bone-marrow transplant. His doctors in the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, in Memphis, believe that Chimerix' antiviral drug is the boy's cure. The doctors recommend the drug as they have used it and worked for other children.The doctors, along with Josh' family and thousands of supporters, have made requests for the production of the drug for the boy.However, numerous requests to get the unapproved medication were turned down by the pharmaceutical company.Chimerix president and CEO Kenneth Moch said that they have been receiving several e-mails and calls from thousands of people that urge them to produce the drug for the boy. However, they can't give it a go as that would mean saying yes to more patients. That situation could hinder the completion of a formal study of the drug.""We have great compassion for this family,"" said Moch to USA Today. ""But this is not just about a single boy.""The rules of FDA permit companies to give unapproved drugs to patients under certain circumstance, which is called ""compassionate use,"" as long as the drug has in clinical testing already. But, for a patient to get such drug, he must meet a couple of criteria first. To qualify for the use of brincidofovir, the patient who will use it must have been on the drug in a previous trial, or must be a newborn with herpes simplex virus.Unfortunately, Josh didn't meet any of those criteria. Furthermore, Chimerix has no current study for kids like him.Without the drug, the hospital and its medical practitioners are left with no choice but to go on with providing Josh with a state-of-the art treatment.""We're trying to save our son,"" who is turning eight this coming March 31, said Todd Hardy, Josh's father to USA Today."

169	"March 11--An obscure Durham drug company is facing a barrage of unwanted national attention for refusing to donate potentially lifesaving drugs to a 7-year-old boy who is gravely ill.Chimerix, a company with no products on the market, has spent the past 13 years developing a virus-killing drug that's now desperately sought by the family of Josh Hardy, an ailing first-grader from Fredericksburg, Va. Josh, a four-time cancer survivor, lies hospitalized with a potentially fatal adenovirus that colonized in his 46-pound body after a bone-marrow transplant.""They keep giving him medicine, and he keeps getting worse,"" said Todd Hardy, the boy's father.Chimerix's experimental drug is so promising that the federal government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is backing the company's work to develop the drug as a weapon against bioterrorism. Chimerix raised $118 million in April in a stock offering on the drug's promise. The drug -- called Brincidofovir (CMX001) -- is not expected to win regulatory approval for public use until late 2016 at the earliest, and Chimerix has not said how much it might cost per dose.The Hardy family's hope stems from Chimerix's history of distributing the medication to 430 patients between 2009 and 2012. Chimerix cut off its ""compassionate care"" program as the drug entered advanced stages of development and testing.Since then Chimerix has turned away hundreds of requests from ill patients, said Chimerix CEO Kenneth Moch. He said that testing drugs on patients requires some patients to take placebos, and it would be difficult to attract patients to a drug study in which seriously ill people might end up taking a useless sugar pill when they could get the drug they need in a competing program.Getting the drug approved -- to where it would be widely available and covered by insurance -- must be a drug developer's priority, even if it means turning down requests from people who need the drug, Moch said.""This is an ethical dilemma of substance,"" Moch said. ""We are heartstricken about this child.""In medicine's endgame of dwindling treatment options, requests like the Hardys' are not unusual, but until recently such negotiations between doctors and drug developers played out in private. Today, desperate families are seizing control and occasionally turning to social media to apply intense pressure when startup drug companies reject a request that doesn't meet ethics guidelines or medical standards.Todd Hardy said he made a personal appeal to Moch by phone but said his legions of supporters will go over the CEO's head.""Basically, he reads off a card,"" Hardy said. ""We're going after the board of directors.""Protest plannedThe Hardy family -- which has been featured in national TV interviews on Fox and CNN and was one of Monday's top trending topics on Twitter -- is organizing a caravan to roll into North Carolina on Thursday. The family intends to stage a televised protest at the headquarters of the 54-employee company with the goal of breaking the drug maker's corporate will.""This is the first time people have tried to use this kind of pressure,"" Moch said. ""If we were to make this drug available for Josh Hardy, then others could make the same request. Could we say 'no' to them? Wouldn't they start a similar campaign?""In a similar campaign, Texas legal aid attorney Andrea Sloan launched a social media blitz last year to obtain experimental drugs to treat her ovarian cancer. Her online petition included support from Wynonna Judd, Rosie O'Donnell and Mia Farrow. The drugmaker, California'sBioMarin, did not offer the medication but Sloan succeeded in getting unproven drugs from another drugmaker. She did not survive her illness.The Hardy family is requesting Chimerix's anti-viral under an established ""compassionate care"" practice in which pharmaceutical companies distribute medications that are still under development to seriously ill patients who have run out of treatment options. The program carries the risk that unproven medicines may prove ineffective or cause dangerous side effects.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration can grant such an emergency approval in less than a day in urgent cases and approved 974 ""compassionate care"" requests of 977 submitted in the 2013 fiscal year. To qualify a patient has to have a serious or life-threatening disease with no treatment alternatives.Drugmakers are not required to offer ""compassionate care"" medications, but those that do typically establish guidelines to make sure the program meets biomedical ethics standards. For Chimerix, that means that the free drugs have to be offered to everyone who qualifies, Moch said.Multinational companies have strict rules about when and how they dispense drugs before they're approved by regulators.""Compassionate use involves unidentified risk and may create a false sense of hope in patients,"" according to standards set by the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical firm. ""Compassionate use also can negatively impact the operations of new or ongoing clinical studies ... and subsequently delay the approval of a new medication.""Chimerix said that Brincidofovir is available under limited circumstances and only a handful of patients are using the drug. Qualifying patients are those who have previously tested the drug in clinical trails, are infected with pox viruses, or are newborns who suffer from a herpes simplex virus.Effectiveness unclearThe Hardy family's request was submitted to Chimerix last week by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., which tested the antiviral drug on 48 patients two years ago and is familiar with its attributes. In the request, Victor Santana, St. Jude's vice president, told Chimerix that the boy is fighting for his life and ""it is likely that after having fought off against childhood cancer for so long, he may succumb to this infection.""Josh Hardy was diagnosed with Stage 5 renal cancer at 9 months of age and has been in and out of hospitals when he wasn't healthy and playing on baseball, basketball and lacrosse teams, his father said. He's had cancer of the lungs and of the thymus and most recently was stricken with leukemia. He is being treated for renal failure; because his immune system is compromised, Josh was infected with adenovirus about three weeks ago.The infection itself raises another complication with Brincidofovir because the antiviral was designed to prevent infections, not to treat them. For that reason it's not clear if the drug would help Josh, Moch said.The St. Jude's clinical trial was conducted on patients with early infections of adenovirus, and the results were not statistically significant, but they showed no side effects, clearing the way for further study. The current trial, using 450 patients, began in September and will continue into 2015, but it's designed to measure the prevention of a similar virus, not adenovirus.Arthur Caplan, head of the medical ethics division of the NYU Langone Medical Center, said companies like Chimerix are in an impossible position. Yielding to public appeals could undermine the development of experimental drugs and skew a health care system that already favors some over others.""Josh has savvy parents. Josh is kind of cute. Josh has a puppy. Josh has a media campaign,"" Caplan said.

170	"Josh Hardy, 7, is dying because a virus is continuously damaging his kidneys and heart. His last hope is a drug from a pharmaceutical company, but the company has denied providing the drug to Josh over fears that it could become a constraint for the drug's approval.	The Food and Drug Administration allows a patient, who has serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatment, to ask a drug company for an experimental drug, even if the drug is still under study process and has not yet been approved by the FDA.	Sometimes companies say yes and sometime say no for their own reasons. Whatever the reason for saying no to provide the drug to Josh, it is really disheartening for his parents as they have no other choice now than to see their son dying every moment.	Josh developed an adenovirus while recovering from a bone marrow transplant. But as the immune system of Josh was weak, the virus started hurting him badly. He managed to survive cancer in his bone marrow, lungs and thymus, but an antiviral caused serious damage to his kidneys.	After the boy failed all other available treatments for his condition, the doctor suggested the family to go for brincidofovir, an experimental drug. But as the drug has not yet been approved by the FDA and still being tested, the family requested the FDA to grant them compassionate use, so as to allow them to use brincidofovir.	However, the drug manufacturer, Chimerix, has turned down the request over fears that if the boy dies while using the drug, the chances of approval for the drug will be in jeopardy even if it is not the mistake of the drug. The company has allowed the drug to be used in compassionate use cases until 2012."	Health

172	"A seven-year-old in an intensive care unit in Memphis, Tennessee has been denied a drug that could prevent his organs failing.Josh Hardy is affected by a Malignant Rhabdoid Tumour (MRT) – which can cause his heart and kidneys to fail.Josh vomits blood several times an hour and has done since he was nine-months-old, when he was diagnosed with the tumour. The condition affects around 15 children every year.Brincidofovir, an antiviral drug manufactured by drug maker company Chimerix, could potentially help Josh.Drug company Chimerix which manufactures Brincidofovir, an antiviral drug that could help Josh, is reluctant to provide the boy with the medicine because this will slow down getting the drug on to the market.As CNN reported, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ""compassionate use"" involves the possibility to use an experimental drug in case of an immediate life-threatening disease, when other available treatments have failed.The drug can be asked for even if researchers are still studying it and it has not yet been approved by the FDA.Pharmaceutical companies can deny the use of the drug in such cases, however.When Chimerix chief executive officer and director Kenneth Moch was asked how he would feel if Josh died, he promptly answered: ""Horrible and heartbroken"".As Moch has children too, he said that if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh, he'd be doing the same thing as Josh's parents.""There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they're going through"".Moch has no intention to provide Josh with the drug.The company would have to dish out $50,000 (£30,064) per compassionate use patient, since insurance doesn't normally pay for experimental drugs, Moch explained.Furthermore, compassionate use of the drug would divert manpower in Chimerix, handling requests and patients' records, as required by the FDA, Moch continued.""If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question. But it's yes to all or no to all,"" he concluded.Doctors at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis have repeatedly asked for the drug too.After requests,they received an email by executive Dr Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company ""was not in a position to provide the drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources"".Todd Hardy, Josh's father told CNN that: ""Our son will die without this drug. We're begging them to give it to us.""Josh's parents have taken to the social media to pressurise the drug company to provide them with the drug.Change.org is also running a campaign to help Josh.Hundreds of people have shown their support to the Hardy family on Twitter, using the hashtag #saveJosh or #JoshHardyprayers go out for #JoshHardy & his family; @chimerix has the meds to save him but refuse, this boy deserves a life you are keeping from himDrug company @chimerix is willing to let a 7yr old die to protect its profits.

174	"One family pleas for the company Chimerex to give a non-FDA approved medication to their 7-year-old son with a life-threatening illness.Josh Hardy, a cancer survivor, has recently contracted a viral infection after a bone marrow transplant, and his family is begging Chimerex to show some compassion.""We're trying to save our son,"" said Josh's dad, Todd Hardy, who is with him at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, according to USA Today.Todd and his wife Aimee have took to social media sites and news stories to put the pressure on the company to give them the antiviral drug called brincidofovir. Thousands more people have contacted Chimerex asking them to consider Josh's case, company president and CEO Kenneth Moch said Monday.But the company, which already turned down Josh's doctor's request for the drug, is not budging.""We have have great compassion for this family,"" Moch said. ""But this is not just about a single boy.""The company receives many requests for compassionate use for the drug, but it can only be doled out to those who meet a specific set of criteria -criteria that Josh does not meet.The ongoing study isn't even testing the drug's effectiveness in children, let alone in people with adenovirus, the type of viral infection that Josh has.A broader compassionate-use program ended two years ago, Moch says, and overall the company has provided the drug to 430 compassionate-use patients. But Chimerex is in a position shared by many small pharmaceutical companies.They have limited resources and worried investors to think about, plus compassionate-use requests can slow down a drug's approval and expose a company to added risks if someone taking the drug outside of the study is harmed, Medical ethicist Arthur Caplan adds.But he can understand a concerned parent's want for their child to be healthy.""I have huge sympathy for the family. I think they are right to try and see what they can get for their child,"" he said.

Josh Hardy is a 7 year old boy from Fredericksburg who should be enjoying himself at school and on the playground of his Elementary School, but instead he battles a virus that is killing him. His family huddles around him at the hospital praying for some cure or relief for their child as he vomits blood frequently. Their hope is that Josh will be allowed to take an experimental drug that has a chance to combat the virus so that he can get better. Those hopes may be short-lived if the company Chimerix does not approve him to take one of their upcoming medications.Chimerix is the manufacturer of a drug that may or may not have the ability to help Josh’s weakened immune system fight off the virus that has damaged his kidneys and other organs. So far they have denied the Hardy family’s requests to allow Josh to take the experimental medication before it is approved by the FDA. At it’s current course, Chimerix expects for this drug to reach the approval state by the FDA in about 2 years, but for now it is just in a clinical trial stage. Since Josh was not part of the clinical trials for the drug, the family was left to seek approval for him to take it under the guidelines for Compassionate Use that the FDA allows for terminally ill patients.The drug manufacturer claims that they will not be able to financially provide the life-saving medication that Josh needs because the costs to supply him the medications would amount to far more than the small company can currently handle. Additionally, if the company agreed to let Josh Hardy take the drug, then they would be subjected to allow other ill patients who have requested use to take it too. This could cause the company to suffer financial stress that could risk the ability for this drug to reach production and help other patients in the near future.Chimerix labels themselves as a producer of therapeutic treatments for those who suffer from various viruses and illnesses. They manufacture and research compounds that can be effective antiviral medications for ill patients. Some of their medications are used in the treatment of viruses such as HIV and Herpes Simplex.Featured Image From Facebook.7 Year Old Josh Hardy Denied Life-Saving Medication By Drug Company.$50,000 is the cost of treatment, a pittance for the life of a precious child. It isn’t about money, its about avoiding adverse events, getting FDA approval and making the company’s investors money in the long run. The FDA and Chimerex are both at fault."	Health

He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil.In a cabinet in Durham, North Carolina, there’s a drug that could likely help Josh Hardy, but the drug company won’t give it to him. They’re adamant that spending the time to help Josh and others like him will slow down their efforts to get this drug on the market.Helping Josh, they say, means hurting others.When asked how he will feel if Josh dies — and he’s in critical condition, so sadly that could happen soon — the president of the company that makes the drug doesn’t hesitate to answer.“Horrible,” said Kenneth Moch. He would feel horrible and heartbroken.But still, he said there’s no way he’s going to change his mind. There’s no way he’s going to give Josh this drug.‘We’re begging them’Photo: The Hardy FamilyIt’s called “compassionate use,” but sometimes it feels anything but compassionate.Here’s the way it works: According to the Food and Drug Administration, if someone has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they’re still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA.Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013.But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as they did to Josh Hardy.“Our son will die without this drug,” said Todd Hardy, Josh’s father. “We’re begging them to give it to us.”So now, like many families, the Hardys have turned to the media, Facebook, and change.org to pressure the drug company to change its mind.Countless members of “Josh’s army” have responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to “open their hearts,” asking the executives how they can sleep at night.“Everyone is watching,” one tweeter warned the company. Others have tweeted out the e-mail addresses of the company’s board members. Chimerix executives say they’ve received physical threats.Moch, the company president, has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken, but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144-long character debate.At its very simplest, this is it: Chimerix is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone.The company would have to dish out $50,000 per compassionate-use patient, since insurance doesn’t usually pay for experimental drugs, Moch said. And perhaps even more important than the money, it would divert manpower in this 50-person company, since they’d have to handle the requests and then get the patient’s records and follow up with them, as required by the FDA.Photo: The Hardy Family“If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,” he said. “But it’s yes to all or no to all.”From 2009 to 2012, the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients, Moch said, but at least at that time, the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along. But currently doctors don’t really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don’t help get the drug to market.Beat cancer four timesJosh’s journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body.They gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys.His doctors at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital said not to give up hope. Since they’d been part of the brincidofovir studies, they’d seen how in sometimes just a week or two, the the oral form of the drug could get rid of an adenovirus without damaging the kidneys. Now all they had to do was ask the company that makes brincidofovir: Chimerix, Inc.On February 12, the St. Jude’s doctors called a Chimerix executive, Dr. Marion Morrison, and asked for permission to use brincidofovir. She said no.On March 5, the doctors asked again. Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive, Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company was not “in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources.”‘He holds our son’s life in his hands’Moch wants you to know that he has children of his own, and if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh, he’d be doing the same thing as Todd and Aimee Hardy.“There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they’re going through,” he said.Art Caplan, a bioethicist, said he feels for both the Hardys and for Moch.“We can’t ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out,” he said.It’s not just the $50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish, Caplan said, but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug. Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug.Perhaps there’s another way to handle compassionate use requests, Caplan suggests. Perhaps a company like Chimerix could agree to give the drug only to the very most dire cases, and put a cap on the number of patients they help.“They might want to open the door a little more broadly,” he said. “They might want to show a little compassion.”But right now, Chimerix stands firm that their compassionate use program is almost completely over.“We’ve had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death, and the answer has been no,” said Mommeja-Marin, the Chimerix executive.But that’s not good enough for the Hardys.“He holds our son’s life in his hands,” Todd Hardy said. “This is just beyond belief to me.”By Elizabeth Cohen, CNN’s Senior Medical CorrespondentCNN’s John Bonifield, Nadia Kounang and intern Arianna Yanes contributed to this report.Filed in: News Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

I would hate to see the kid die. He has been through so much. But i will say this with no offense. If he did die i think his body should be studied. Think about this for a minute. He has four types of cancer in seven years. Thats unheard of really. So maybe with the right people and tools they can help figure out what causes this. I mean most people have one type of cancer in life. He had four maybe theres something in him we are missing. Just maybe his body can explain four things instead of a body only infected with one. This boy could hold the key to saving many many lives. However.His right to live comes first.i also don’t want to see this child die, it’s a horrible feeling just reading this article and seeing how he’s dying a slow death. however i also understand the complicated bureaucracy behind the FDA, the approval of drugs, and all that jazz. because of how complicated the FDA makes it to make drugs available, Chimerix should not make any exceptions to show the inefficiency of the FDA. do NOT make the same mistake as cigna v. sarkisyan case.There is a simple solution, don’t require the drug company to include the compassionate use cases in their studies.  In any case 50k is “spit in the bucket” in comparison to the millions they will make once it hits the market.   The needs of the many do not outweigh the needs of the few when you are talking life and death especially in the case of a child.  I would like a list of the drugs this company markets because if they let this child die, I will never intentionally use any of their products.  If empty pockets float your boats stick to your merciless policy and suffer the consequences.

(WTVR)--Seven-year-old Josh Hardy has been cancer free for two years, but just shy of his eighth birthday, he's still fighting for his life.He has already already beaten cancer four times, but it's something else compromising his life.Now he has a rare virus that took advantage of his compromised immune system during a life-saving bone marrow transplant.It’s another obstacle Josh's parents are afraid he might not be able to conquer.He is in critical condition and his mother said that the “clock is ticking.”Josh's doctors say there is only one drug that could rid his body of the virus.But right now the company who makes it says they can't give it to him.Mae Staton, Josh's grandmother calls him a ""tough little boy,” after all he was just 9-months-old when ""he was diagnosed with cancer tumors on his kidney's.He defeated the cancer and battled it again three more times.Most recently, his grandmother says, he went back in November for a checkup and they found “something irregular in his blood, and they did some tests  and determined he needed a bone marrow transplant.""But the fight since his January transplant has been tough.""He was in a coma for 16 days, Staton says.And it was coming out of the coma in mid-January that his next fight began.He contracted a virus; one that doctors say requires one particular drug called Brincidofovir (brenz-a-dof-a-veer).""This virus has really done a number on his little body, he's bleeding internally and he's in a lot of pain,” Staton says.Doctors at St. Jude’s tell his parents that he needs this drug that this Chimerex company has developed.""The company which makes the drug says it can't be released outside of controlled clinical trials.They released a statement that reads:""This is one of hundreds of requests that Chimerix has received for the compassionate use of Brincidofovir.  Providing Brincidofovir in any of these situations where there is currently limited evidence to suggest that Brincidofovir would be helpful, could very likely place the entire development program at risk.""The family, which has spoken with the company, continues to plead their case.“Mr. Moch, have a heart, this child needs to live, release this drug, so that he can have a healthy, happy life.""Friends of the family are planning a protest outside the North Carolina based company on Thursday.We will continue to provide updates as they develop.To find out more about this story, please visit these links.Filed in: News Topics: Fredericksburg, Josh Hardy Thank you CBS for providing coverage on this.See, I don’t get that, why with hold it if it’s a life or death situation? I don’t see how it can jeopardize the program unless they intend to include his results in their clinical findings. Just let them try. Keep it separate from any trials ect that are already in place. Perhaps there’s something the FDA could do?This is a government regulation issue.  Drug companies cannot just dole out unapproved products outside of trial.  This article is a gross misrepresentation of fault.Yes they can. Investigational drugs CAN be given in circumstances like these. It’s called ‘compassionate drug use’.Okay, the Obamas always tell everyone how compassionate they are. They are very wealthy. So is John Kerry. Why don’t they step up and save this little boy by buying the medicine for him? Where are Warren Buffet and Bill Gates? They could easily pay for the medicine, but they sit quietly ignoring the dying little boy.George, you realize that you’re feeding the stereotype that conservatives lack critical thinking and reading comprehension skills.  Money is not at issue here.  Read it again, and this time try to REALLY pay attention to it.The company is not refusing to give the medicine to the child because of financial issues alone. The company that manufactures this drug has been in the trial phase for years because of the enormous amount of extra funds needed to make compassionate use possible. If you actually took the time to look further into this issue you would find out that this company stopped compassionate use two years ago so that they could focus on finishing up development and getting the drug FDA approved for the majority of patients in need. Montani, before you bash people maybe you should be the one to check your facts; but then again, ignorance is bliss.Or we could just have a world-class healthcare program that takes care of all sick kids.Kelly, the CEO said this morning the reason his company could not provide the medicine, which it had provided to several hundred people previously, was due to the financial condition of his company. YOU need to learn a little about the situation and quit relying on liberal media for your information. I am sure the CEO would be a much better source of the reason why the medicine would not be provided than a news room.“I am sure the CEO would be a much better source of the reason why the medicine would not be provided than a news room.”  You can not be serious montani.My heart goes out to this family.  I know as a mother I would feel the same way as they do but unfortunately when being objective you have to understand the position of the drug company.  Do any of you think this is the first request they have received for this drug? I totally understand the reason for compassionate use but to others who think it will not mess up a drug study think again.  All information related to this drug will be submitted to the fda along with the study.  It does mess up a controlled study.  Drug companies are a business.  They are not government or run by the government and are in business to make money.  Most will not risk the trials of their drugs they have spent millions to reseach and develop because of a few people who want to try it outside of their control.  If this was done with every drug then most drug companies would be out of business.  My heart goes out to this child and his family.  I pray there is another solution for this little boy.First, I’d love to see comments that aren’t about politics.  Second, I pray for this little boy, the one this story is about!!  Not Obama or anyone else.The only thing cheaper than talk is prayer.I don’t care about Obama, Kerry, gates or any other billionaire every person has spoke of. This is a sick child that can be cured with a certain medication and it is not being given to him. I can 100 % guarantee you that if that boy was the son of the CEO of this company he would have this medicine and none of us would ever know about it. I for one am sick of huge medical companies having all the rights why people die from Cancer, Diabetes, and so many other illness’s that have been proven the Government has the cure for. This child deserves to live and there is a cure. Do not care about test results, FDA, or any other thing….let this precious angel have a chance at a normal disease free life!!!!Comments are closed.

183	"MEMPHIS, Tenn. — In an intensive care unit in Memphis, a virus ravages the body of a 7-year-old who’s in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil.In a cabinet in Durham, North Carolina, there’s a drug that could likely help Josh Hardy, but the drug company won’t give it to him.

185	"by Suzanne Kennedy(WJLA) - Seven-year-old Josh Hardy is fighting for his life. This Fredericksburg first-grader has beat cancer four times since he was nine months old. Now, he faces a new challenge: a virus he contracted after a January bone marrow transplant.""He is working his butt off,"" says his mother, Aimee Hardy.Josh’s mother is currently with him at a Memphis hospital, where doctors have told her that a medicine currently in clinical trials could save him. Brincidofovir is an anti-viral drug that is currently not on the market.“I just feel like there is a way to do this,"" she says.  ""Where there is a will, there is a way, and we're really just not going to sit back when there's a drug available to make all the difference in the world for our son.""Now, a social media campaign has been launched to put pressure on the drug’s manufacturer to give the medicine to Josh’s doctors. In a statement on Monday, the company -- Chimerix Inc. -- responded:  This is one of hundreds of requests that Chimerix has received for the compassionate use of Brincidofovir.  Providing Brincidofovir in any of these situations could very likely place the entire development program for Brincidofovir at risk.Family and friends are rallying around this little boy in the hopes that the drug company will finally give in.""It's heartbreaking.  It's unbelievable that there is a drug that could help this young man and its being withheld,"" says neighbor Dave Grinnan.""We just pray to God that Josh is gonna be here and trust in God that he's going to make him better and he's going to be home with us again and be the old Joshie,"" adds his grandmother, Mae Staton.UPDATE: On Tuesday, March 11, Chimerix Inc. released a statement confirming that it would provide Josh Hardy with the drug. The release includes the following:Chimerix, Inc. (Nasdaq:CMRX) today announced that it has reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the immediate initiation of a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients. FDA has committed to work expeditiously with Chimerix on the design of a pivotal Phase 3 study that would be a continuation of this pilot study. Josh Hardy's story brought to public attention the often-devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix regarding the need for additional clinical development to assess brincidofovir's potential in adenovirus infection. This study is expected to begin with Josh Hardy as the first patient enrolled on Wednesday, March 12, 2014.""This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone,"" said Kenneth I. Moch, President & CEO of Chimerix. ""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.""""We are pleased to be providing access to brincidofovir in a manner consistent with our focus on progressing clinical development toward a potential regulatory approval that would make it widely available to patients who might benefit from its use,"" said Hervé Momméja-Marin, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Research of Chimerix. ""We are grateful to the FDA for their continuous guidance and assistance in expediting brincidofovir's development path forward."""	Health

187	"Sign in to comment!FOX NEWS INSIDER - Peter Johnson Jr. reported this morning on a harrowing story pitting the family of a seven-year-old Virginia boy against a drug company. Josh Hardy was stricken with an infection called an adenovirus after undergoing a bone marrow transplant in January.Josh has been fighting and winning his battle against cancer, along with heart and kidney issues, since he was less than a year old. Now, his mother, Aimee Hardy, says he will die if the curable virus is not treated soon.Doctors believe the adenovirus can be cured with a drug named Brincidofovir, which is in the trial stage and has not been approved by the FDA. Doctors say the drug has been used successfully on kids with Josh's infection.Aimee says the drug maker, Chimerix, has so far refused their urgent pleas to give doctors the drug on ""compassionate use"" grounds. Kenneth Moch, the company’s president and CEO, said Friday that the company cannot approve ""compassionate use"" of the drug right now because it is in phase-three of the clinical development process.“We understand this great need.That’s what drives us to focus on getting it available. It creates these really difficult complex situations where the need to pursue the formal clinical development under the FDA process takes precedent over other needs. As we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials, we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning FDA approval,"" said Moch, who added that his company is “acutely aware of the situation faced by this patient.”Fox and Friends pointed out this morning that Chimerix has received $72 million in federal funds. Aimee called on the company to change its position, saying ""there has got to be some other way to make this available to everyone.""""To me it's almost a crime not to make it available to everyone who needs it and I definitely am going to keep fighting for my son until they give it,"" said Hardy.Check your TV service provider to stream from your computerThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

194	"A blood test can accurately predict the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, according to US researchers.They showed that testing levels of 10 fats in the blood could predict – with 90% accuracy – the risk of the disease coming on in the next three years. The 10 markers of Alzheimer’s could predict who was likely to enter mental decline in the following years.The full power of the test has not been investigated either. So far they know a diagnosis of dementia can be predicted three years ahead of time, but the researchers are now investigating whether the test works even earlier.Nature Medicine – Plasma phospholipids identify antecedent memory impairment in older adults
 Alzheimer’s disease causes a progressive dementia that currently affects over 35 million individuals worldwide and is expected to affect 115 million by 2050. There are no cures or disease-modifying therapies, and this may be due to our inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to produce evident memory loss and functional decline. Biomarkers of preclinical disease will be critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative therapies. Unfortunately, current biomarkers for early disease, including cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-β levels, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and the recent use of brain amyloid imaging or inflammaging, are limited because they are either invasive, time-consuming or expensive. Blood-based biomarkers may be a more attractive option, but none can currently detect preclinical Alzheimer’s disease with the required sensitivity and specificity. Herein, we describe our lipidomic approach to detecting preclinical Alzheimer’s disease in a group of cognitively normal older adults. We discovered and validated a set of ten lipids from peripheral blood that predicted phenoconversion to either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within a 2–3 year timeframe with over 90% accuracy. This biomarker panel, reflecting cell membrane integrity, may be sensitive to early neurodegeneration of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.

196	"If you could take a test that would predict whether or not you would get Alzheimer’s disease, would you take it? You might face that choice in a few years.Dr. Howard Federoff at Georgetown University thinks his team has come up with exactly that kind of test.“We sought to predict who in the next several years will develop cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease and that is exactly what we’ve found,” Federoff said. “We may be able to test for the first time whether or not disease modifying therapies might be able to delay developing the disease. It's a simple blood test that ties low levels of lipids to the disease that has no cure. KTRH medical expert Dr. Joe Galati says it might turn out to be a good thing.""This is preliminary research but anytime we can find out earlier about a disease it’s going to be beneficial,” Galati said. “It’s a breakthrough in trying to find out early and whether or not there are some lifestyle and nutritional changes can be made. Those are good.”But he also has reservations.“Do you want to find out when you’re 40-years old and in the prime of your life that you have a potentially life threatening disease?” Galati asked. “Is this something we want to know? What’s the impact on your health insurance? If your carrier finds out you could develop the disease will we get into insurance and financial issues?While this test might very well be a breakthrough, you're years away from being able to get this test at your doctor's office.© 2018 iHeartMedia, Inc.Content Goes Here"	Health

            By Anna Claire Vollersavollers@al.com“When you lose somebody with dementia, it’s almost like you’ve lost them twice.”Marsha Farrell is intimately familiar with the toll that a dementia or Alzheimer’s diagnosis takes on the family members surrounding the person with the disease. She’s a registered nurse, a certified hospice and palliative nurse, and the education institute coordinator for Hospice Family Care in Huntsville, the only non-profit hospice agency in Madison County.Farrell has worked with many families struggling to care for loved ones with dementia or Alzheimer’s.“It’s a long process of anticipatory grief,” said Farrell. “Every little thing they lose, you grieve – when your mom can’t walk anymore, then when she can’t use a wheelchair anymore, then when she can’t remember who you are.“The patient grieves when they can’t remember how to get home, then can’t remember how to carry on a conversation. There are all these losses that families are dealing with constantly throughout the disease.”Caring for a loved one with dementia or Alzheimer’s can be an exhausting process, both physically and emotionally. It can also be a long process, since a person could live 10 or more years past the original diagnosis thanks to early detection.As a hospice nurse, Farrell stresses the importance of family caregivers taking good care of themselves.“We don’t need to burn out caregivers and ruin their health,” she said. “Always, always ask for help.”Support groups in the community are available for caregivers of people with diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s. And the Alzheimer’s Association offers tips for caregivers on how best to manage their own health while looking after someone else’s. The AA website also offers information about topics like caregiver stress, depression, relationship changes and grief/loss. There’s even a quiz to help caregivers understand their own level of stress. Farrell also points out that part of asking for help is being honest with doctors, and being willing to ask the hard questions about the parent or spouse’s realistic prognosis. Is he or she in the late stages of the disease, and might be appropriate for hospice care?“Sometimes the doctor may not want to bring it up,” said Farrell. “I encourage caregivers to bring it up so they can understand where they are.”Many people are uncomfortable with the idea of asking about hospice, said Farrell, associating it with death or believing hospice is only brought in for the last few days of a person’s life.“Hospice is not for people who are actively dying; it’s for people living with a terminal illness,” said Farrell. “If hospice is used appropriately, we would have people for weeks and months, rather than for days. “I like to say that all of my patients are 100 percent alive. We don’t take care of dead people – that’s for the funeral homes.”A physician is the one who can make the determination if a patient is a candidate for hospice services. The Medicare guideline, which is followed by private insurance companies, says hospice is appropriate for people who have been given an expected prognosis of six months or less. Medicare or private insurance pays for hospice services, which are administered by a team of registered nurses, home health aides, social workers and even chaplains and volunteers.Hospice assists the patient with medical care for pain and symptom management, assistance processing paperwork and finding resources for financial support, and also provides support groups and encouragement for family and caregivers. At Hospice Family Care, grief and bereavement services are offered to family members up to 13 months after the death of the loved one – to get them through the first anniversary of the person’s death.“People shy away from the word ‘hospice’ and they don’t realize,” said Farrell, “that what we really do is we affirm life.”

Imagine that your closest loved one is unable to identify who you are. One of the hardest life events to deal with is having a family member who has just been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. Understandably, many families have difficulty coming to terms with this situation. There may be feelings of hopelessness when someone cannot sustain the same connection that he or she once shared with that person. One of the ways to help families is to provide educational support on ways to communicate with their loved one.Many of us do not think of communication as a continuous learning process, but the reality is our interactions change as we age. The ways in which we communicate with those who have Alzheimer’s and dementia are still fairly new and are being put into practice. Keeping track of effective versus non-effective communication can ultimately impact someone’s behavior. Although it may be tempting to correct your loved one when he or she is describing an event, the description may be a report of feelings and not facts.The structure of a speaker’s sentence makes a huge difference when talking with someone with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. They can interpret the words such as “don’t, shouldn’t, and can’t” as confrontational.One suggestion is try to redirect the conversation to a more positive experience. An example of this is to provide explanation for an aggressive situation, such as a verbal argument. The elderly adult can react negatively to the speaker because he or she is minimizing that elder’s freedom to be more independent. The person talking may be seen as acting as an authoritative figure because he or she is essentially directing them to act or behavior in a certain way.Another communication suggestion is to remember that too much questioning or over speaking in general can be overwhelming for someone with Alzheimer’s disease and that simple sentences work much more effectively.As a caregiver working at an assisted living facility, I have learned to pay closer attention to how I communicate and interact with the elderly. Each elderly adult that comes in and out of the facility has made me appreciate my job more and more.I feel privileged when he or she opens up to me about their fun memories growing up. I understand that family members become concern when their loved one is not communicating the same as they use to. I would like to remind family members that your presence is highly important and to try to continuously visit your loved one. Many elder adults enjoy having company and will open if someone is there to listen and speak with him or her.We need to reexamine our communication and interactions that we share with one another because we have to remember how we want to be treated. This is especially important, as we get older because many elder adults do not get the social attention that they deserve. I would suggest that more people practice their communication and keep in mind that face-to-face conversations have the most sentimental value.Kara Wise is a graduate of Waunakee High School now attending UW-Whitewater.

201	"WASHINGTON D.C. – A potential game-changer has been found in a recent first-of-its-kind medical study!Simple blood tests can accurately predict whether or not a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease.Georgetown University Medical Center researchers looked at the blood of healthy elderly people, and judging by the amount of lipids, they could tell who was likely to get Alzheimer’s. They say their test has been 90% accurate. Of course, other labs will have to validate the tests.The thing is, there isn’t an actual cure for Alzheimer’s, but knowing in advance might be able to help your family prepare.Alzheimer’s is a potentially fatal disease. About half a million people died from it in 2010, which means it could be the nation’s third-most deadly killer.Needless to say, it would make sense if you might not want to know you’re destined for the disease.Filed in: NewsFix Let us know!

202	"April Flowers for redOrbit.com – Your Universe Online A new study, led by Georgetown University, reveals that a blood test has been discovered and validated that can predict, with 90 percent accuracy, if a healthy person will develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease within three years.Ten lipids, or fats, that predict disease are identified in the blood by the new test, which could be ready for use in clinical trials in as little as two years. The researchers are hopeful for other diagnostic uses as well.""Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,"" says Howard J. Federoff, MD, PhD, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center.To date, there is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Approximately 35.6 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), that number will double every 20 years. They predict 115.4 million sufferers by 2050.There have been many efforts to develop drug therapies to slow or reverse the disease's progression, but according to Federoff, all have failed so far. He believes that one reason for this failure is that the drugs were evaluated too late in the disease process.""The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,"" Federoff says. ""Biomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics.""The researchers recruited 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older. The participants all gave blood samples at the beginning of the study and at various points during the study. Over the five-year study period, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) or a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory loss is prominent. Forty-six of this group were diagnosed upon enrollment in the study and 28 (called converters) developed aMCI or mild AD during the study.During the study's third year, 53 participants who developed aMCI/AD (including 18 converters) and 53 cognitively normal matched controls were selected for the lipid biomarker discovery phase of the study. The lipids were not the initial focus of the study; instead, they were an outcome.The researchers discovered a panel of 10 lipids that appear to reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in study participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or AD. The team validated the panel using the remaining 21 aMCI/AD participants (including 10 converters), and 20 controls. To determine if the subjects could be characterized into the correct diagnostic categories based solely on the panel of 10 lipids identified in the discovery phase, the data was analyzed blind.""The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 percent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,"" Federoff says.The research team also investigated the possibility that the APOE4 gene, known to be a risk factor for developing AD, would contribute to accurate classifications of the groups. They found it was not a significant predictive factor, however.""We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals,"" Federoff says. ""We're designing a clinical trial where we'll use this panel to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer's to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease."""

204	In 2011, the first of the baby boom generation reached what used to be considered retirement age. And for the next 15-plus years, they’ll be turning 65 at a rate of about 8,000 a day. As a result, health officials estimate the number of people living with Alzheimer’s disease could triple by 2050.Knowing how to properly care for someone in cognitive decline can be overwhelming, so Harper College’s Continuing Education department is launching a new online class, “Dementia for Family Caregivers.” The class, which runs April 7 through May 2, is designed for family caregivers dealing with Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia or other conditions that cause significant memory problems.“Our instinct is to treat these adults like children, which should be avoided,” instructor Pamela Atwood said. “This class is really designed to teach family caregivers practical applied strategies and how to be advocates.”Atwood, a 25-year veteran of the health care industry, said students will also learn about the basics about dementia, common health complications and receive tips from professional care providers. “There can be some bizarre and uncomfortable moments for caregivers, but there are ways to find moments of gratitude and grace during this very difficult disease process,” she said.Tuition for the online class is $149.

205	"For the first time, a test that detects 10 types of lipids, or fats, circulating in a person's blood has been shown to predict accurately whether he or she will develop the memory loss and mental decline of Alzheimer's disease over the next two to three years. A screening test based on the findings could be available in as little as two years, said the researchers who identified the blood biomarkers.The effort to identify predictors of Alzheimer's disease that are reliable, easy and inexpensive to detect was described Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine. Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's could make it possible to identify those at risk before they develop symptoms, the authors suggested.While no treatments for Alzheimer's have proven effective in slowing or reversing its progress, the authors declared that earlier detection may open new treatment options. Interventions to head off or slow cognitive decline before it is evident might be more effective than intervening later, when dementia has already set in.The researchers — from the University of Rochester, Georgetown University and the University of California, Irvine — did not start with a list of possible biomarkers, but recruited 525 subjects at least 70 years old. The team scoured their blood for possibilities while waiting to see which subjects would develop dementia symptoms.Forty-six subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease upon entry into the study. And 28 went on to develop mild Alzheimer's or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a condition that often progresses to full-blown Alzheimer's. The researchers compared the blood of 53 of those 74 subjects with that of 53 matched subjects who had developed no cognitive abnormalities. The analysis allowed them to identify measurable differences between the groups in 10 different lipids.The 10 lipids identified as harbingers of Alzheimer's appear to be the result of the breakdown of neural cell membranes, a process that accelerates as the disease takes hold.Once they had the list of revealing lipids, the study authors gathered 41 of their recruits: 21 who had developed early Alzheimer's in the course of the study and 20 who had not. Blinded to the subjects' status, the researchers tried to see if they could use the 10-lipids panel to sort the subjects correctly on the basis of their blood tests alone. They found they could do so, with over 90 per cent accuracy.That's an accuracy level on a par with tests that measure the cerebrospinal fluid for evidence of abnormal proteins that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. But because a blood test would be much cheaper and less invasive than a spinal tap, it would make screening large populations of people far more practical.Among the issues still to be sorted out: how revealing the 10-lipids blood panel would be in a larger and more diverse population of patients; and how sensitive and specific such a screen would be. Many tests are able to identify 100 per cent of people who are sick with a particular disease (they're highly sensitive), but they also falsely identify many as sick who are not (they're not very specific).If patients test positive for impending Alzheimer's, many may accept treatments that are expensive and risky in a bid to head it off.

As a result, it's important to establish that the 10-lipids test does not have a very high ""false positive"" rate.Los Angeles Times"	Health

207	"The obsession that some in journalism have with “simple” blood tests – the unquestioning “test for everything” mentality that shines through in so many stories – is, itself, bloodcurdling.Yesterday we wrote about how CNN stated that an Alzheimer’s test had “astonishing accuracy” – when another solid news story reported that “the accuracy fell short of what would normally be acceptable for a screening test.” CNN wasn’t alone in hyping that study, but so far at least, they lead the journalism world on this next one.Today CNN.com reports on an observational study that made an association between four biomarkers and risk of death and reported:Will you be alive five years from now? New research suggests it might be possible to predict if you’ll die from a medical condition in the next half-decade.How, you ask? With a simple blood test.According to a recent study published in the journal PLOS Medicine, if your blood registers high levels of four “biomarkers,” biological molecules found in your blood, body fluids, or tissues, you are at a substantially higher risk of dying in the next five years.And that same CNN.com story appears on many TV station websites across the country.  Follow the leader.But the leader is woefully incomplete on this one.You don’t need to look any further than the “What Do These Findings Mean?” section of the published study.  It would seem that if you’re not quite sure about what the findings mean, you might want to at least refer to that section, which states (my emphasis added):However, there are several limitations to this study. As an observational study, it provides evidence of only a correlation between a biomarker score and ill health. It does not identify any underlying causes. Other factors… might be the true cause of serious health problems and would provide a more accurate assessment of risk. Nor does this study identify what kinds of treatment might prove successful in reducing the risks. Therefore, more research is needed to determine whether testing for these biomarkers would provide any clinical benefit.The observational nature of the study was not mentioned by CNN. An observational study can not establish cause-and-effect.  So talking about “risk” – as in CNN’s 5th sentence, “…you are at a substantially higher risk of dying in the next five years.” – is technically inaccurate.   Establishing risk means you’ve established cause-and-effect to define the risk. Anything else is fear-mongering about boogeymen at this point.The CNN story’s final sentence – if you made it that far – read, “So don’t obsess too much over your annual blood tests just yet; more research is needed.” But that’s a far cry from the first five sentences of the story, which I posted above.  Stories like this – and yesterday’s Alzheimer’s test story – fuel the obsession that you now tell people to ignore in your final throwaway line.My summary:—————-Tweet// <![CDATA[

									03.10.2014A radiologist examines a brain scan for signs of Alzheimer's Disease.A blood test for Alzheimer’s capable of predicting whether a person will develop dementia has been developed in a breakthrough hailed by campaigners.The test could ultimately lead to successful treatment that would halt or even prevent the disease, scientists said.The research found that biomarkers in the blood could be used to forecast whether a person would develop Alzheimer’s disease within three years with a 90 per cent level of accuracy.Charities said Sunday that the findings from the American trial were encouraging and could signify an important advance in dementia treatment. However, they also warned of ethical dilemmas ahead and said patients must be given a choice about whether they wanted to receive potentially devastating news about their future.Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s health secretary, told an international summit on dementia last month that the development of such tests could constitute ""a massive step forward"" in the battle against the disease. Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ""This is a really welcome development - it takes us a step closer to something that could impact on the lives of thousands of people with dementia.""The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, identified 10 molecules in the blood that could be used to predict with at least 90 per cent accuracy whether people went on to develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s. It is the first study to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between those who went on to suffer the disease, and those who remained ""cognitively normal"".Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre in Washington DC said blood tests to identify those likely to develop dementia could be used in major clinical trials within two years.Existing drugs for Alzheimer’s disease work best if given early, and can lessen the symptoms, but do not slow overall progression of disease.Scientists believe the best hope of finding a breakthrough treatment, which can slow or reverse progression of the condition, may come if drugs can be given long before patients show signs of disease.Professor Howard Federoff, one of the study’s authors, said that being able to predict the disease before it was symptomatic could offer a ""window of opportunity"" that could be critical to developing effective drugs to combat the condition before it took hold.Researchers said the results were ""a major step forward"" towards introducing large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals, and test possible treatments and preventative drugs.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at the charity Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ""Alzheimer’s disease begins to develop long before symptoms such as memory loss appear, but detecting the disease at this pre-symptomatic stage has so far proved difficult. ""More work is needed to confirm these findings, but a blood test to identify people at risk of Alzheimer’s could be an important finding for research.""He said further studies were needed on larger groups of people, to see if treatments were more effective if given earlier. ""These are encouraging findings, but it’s vital to continue investing in research to capitalise on results like these,"" he said.Scientists from Georgetown University Medical Centre examined 525 healthy participants aged 70 and over and monitored them for five years.They regularly analysed blood samples from 53 participants who developed dementia, comparing them with those from 53 ""cognitively normal"" people.When they tracked back, they found that the biomarkers could predict with 90 per cent accuracy whether participants went on to develop Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment.Prof Federoff, a professor of neurology at Georgetown University, said: ""The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 per cent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future.""The researchers are now designing a further study in which those forecast to have a high risk of Alzheimer’s are given access to experimental treatments that may delay or prevent the condition.One in three people will develop dementia in their lifetime, and a rapidly ageing population means that the numbers are forecast to double within two decades.More than 800,000 people in the UK have a form of dementia - most commonly Alzheimer’s disease - but government estimates suggest that just half of cases receive a diagnosis.Your account has been deactivated.Sorry, we could not verify that email address.Your account has been reactivated.

210	"Dementia affects 44 million people globally,  a figure that is set to treble by 2050. Without intervention this could be reflected in a rise of the £370b that is currently spent worldwide per year.Alzheimer's can attack the brain for more than a decade before any symptoms reveal themselves. It has been suggested that the drug trials are failing because the patients are being treated too late to make a difference.Scientific breakthroughs have the potential to transform medical research and allowing drugs to be tested at a much earlier, critical stage.What has been discovered?Scientists at Georgetown University in Washington DC analysed blood samples from 525 people over the age of 70 as part of a five-year study. They tested the blood of 53 of those who developed Alzheimer's or a mild cognitive impairment and compared it to those who stayed mentally agile.The found differences in the levels of 10 lipids (fats) between the two groups. They showed that measuring the levels of these fats in people will allow them to predict - with 90% accuracy - the risk of the onset of the disease three years in advance, with potential for even earlier.It is not clear exactly what is causing the change in fats in the blood, but it could be a residue of the early changes in the brain.The findings, published in Nature Medicine, will now be tested in larger clinical trials.Howard Federoff, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center, told the BBC: ""I think there is a huge need for a test.Dr Simon Ridley, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said the findings were ""encouraging"" and that a blood test would be a ""real step forward"".""If confirmed, these results could also aid efforts to develop better tools for diagnosing Alzheimer's - allowing people with the disease to access crucial support and existing treatments sooner.""There are no comments for this article, be the first to comment!Only registered users can comment.

	Researchers in the United States say they have developed a blood test that can predict with more than 90 per cent accuracy whether someone will develop Alzheimer’s disease within three years.
	Dr. Howard J. Federoff, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center, led a team that set out to find a set of molecules in healthy subjects that could predict whether they would develop either mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s.
	“That is exactly what we found,” Federoff said in a video statement issued by Georgetown on Sunday. The blood test identifies ten lipids, or fats, that predict disease onset.
	For their study, the researchers enrolled 525 healthy subjects aged 70 and older who gave blood at the outset and at regular intervals. Over five years, 74 subjects met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer’s disease or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), the main symptom of which is memory loss.
	Comparing 53 of these subjects against the same number of cognitively normal subjects, the researchers discovered the ten lipids that they say revealed the breakdown of neural cell membranes in those that developed symptoms of cognitive impairment.
	The discovery of the lipids was confirmed in the remaining subjects who developed either Alzheimer’s or aMCI against the same number of controls.
	“The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 per cent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,” Federoff said.
	The researchers say their study is the first that identifies blood-based biomarkers that predict Alzheimer’s. However, the test may not be ready for use in clinical studies for another two years.
	Identifying patients who are most likely to develop Alzheimer’s could help scientists develop prevention and treatment methods that will delay, or perhaps even prevent, disease development. The team is designing a clinical trial to identify high-risk subjects in order to test just such a drug.
	The findings are published in the April edition of the journal Nature Medicine.
	Lisa Loiselle, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Waterloo, says that if the test proves 100-per-cent accurate, it “could be very, very valuable.”
	However, she told CTV News Channel Monday that she has some reservations about the study, including that the subjects were all 70 or older.
	“Individuals who are 70 years of age and older generally have higher risk factors for developing dementia to begin with,” Loiselle said. “Those who are older also have a higher lipid count in their blood. So we have to take that into perspective.”
	Loiselle said she would like to see the study’s results replicated in patients under age 70.
	In his video statement, Federoff notes that more than 35 million people suffer from Alzheimer’s around the world, and by the middle of this century that figure is expected to balloon to more than 100 million.
	Up to now, drugs that have been developed to slow the onset of disease have largely failed, but that could be because they were tested in patients who were already diagnosed; in other words, too late.
	“The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,” Federoff said. “Biomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics.”First-year Northwestern University medical student Jared Worthington, left, walks with his ""Alzheimer's buddy,"" retired physician Dan Winship, in Chicago in this Feb. 28, 2014 photo.

213	"A player warms up at Lake Nokomis in preparation for the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships.Photo: Jim Gehrz/Star TribuneBUYSHAREABOUTAbout eight years ago my mom began to demonstrate personality changes and memory issues.  Mummy, as we affectionately called her, was repeating herself, having difficulty communicating and had begun hoarding -- plastic bags, Kleenex, pennies and even little pats of butter.Looking for answers, my sister took Mummy to see her family doctor, calling ahead to advise him of the memory issues and obsessive behavior.During her appointment, the doctor asked a series of questions, conducted a cursory exam and within minutes had a ""diagnosis.""""Don't worry,"" he said, patting my mother's hand, ""It's not Alzheimer's disease.  It's only dementia.""My mom left her doctor's office feeling relieved that day.  However, by this point in our lives, my sister and I had had plenty of experience with Alzheimer's disease.  We knew there was plenty to worry about.This doctor's visit happened eight years ago, but there is still a confusion surrounding Alzheimer's and dementia.  Many people use the terms interchangeably -- giving the impression they are one in the same.  Others, think both Alzheimer's and dementia are diseases, with dementia being less damaging or severe than Alzheimer's disease.These myths are widespread, even among the media some healthcare providers, and are very difficult to dispel.Why?First, it can be challenging to wrap your head around this complex subject.  The confusion may also stem from a lack of clear reporting in the media.  Additionally, Alzheimer's has become a dreaded word.  It's a word many people avoid using, preferring instead the softer, less-threatening term, 'dementia.'Whatever the reason, the all-to-common misconception is that Alzheimer's disease and dementia are one in the same.They are not.To understand dementia, you have to first recognize it is not a disease.  Rather, it is an overall, umbrella term used to describe a group of symptoms that affect a person's mental and physical abilities.You could compare it to the term fever, which tells you a person has an elevated temperature with perhaps other accompanying symptoms.  However, fever is caused by something that is happening in the body.The same is true of dementia -- it is result of something happening to the body.There are many types of dementia symptoms and they can often vary from person-to-person.  Some of the more common symptoms are short-term memory loss, depression, irritability and mood changes, lack of coordination and motor skills, difficulty walking, loss of communication skills, difficulty solving problems, repetitive behaviors and a change in sleep patterns.So, what is the root cause of these dementia symptoms?Alzheimer's, a progressive, always fatal brain disease, is the culprit in about 70 percent of the dementia cases and affects more than 5.3 million in the U.S. alone.Yet, you can have dementia symptoms and not have Alzheimer's disease.Other diseases that bring about dementia symptoms include dementia with Lewy Bodies, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, prolonged and excessive alcohol or drug use as well as several other rare types of diseases also affecting the brain.  Although dementia symptoms vary widely, all of these diseases affect a person's thinking, behavior and memory.  The disease steals the person's cognitive abilities and destroys their lives in the process.Knowledge is power.  The more we know and the better we can communicate about Alzheimer's,  the more powerful we become.  Use your power to set the record straight about the myth that Alzheimer's and dementia are one in the same.You may open up some conversations about this disease and who knows where it might lead?

216	"Scientists who tested seniors found that the test detected almost all of those who would develop problems.HealthDay News -- A blood test has been developed that can predict with 90% certainty whether a senior will suffer from dementia such as Alzheimer disease within the next few years, according to a study published online March 9 in Nature Medicine. The test relies on levels of 10 lipids in the bloodstream to estimate the chances of either mild cognitive impairment or the beginnings of Alzheimer disease.The study involved 525 healthy people aged 70 years or older who underwent a full blood exam and a battery of neurocognitive tests. The research team then followed the participants for 5 years. During the course of the study, 74 of the people developed dementia or mild Alzheimer disease. Researchers compared their blood to the blood of people who showed no signs of cognitive decline. They found that people who later developed dementia started out with low levels of a series of 10 lipids, compared with the other study participants.

In fact, they found the blood test predicted dementia with better accuracy than the APOE test alone.""The results, while intriguing, are preliminary,"" Maria Carrillo, PhD, vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association, told HealthDay.

217	"Scientists have developed a blood test that can diagnose who is at risk for Alzheimer's disease with ninety percent accuracy three years before symptoms appear. The blood test measures levels of 10 lipids, or fats in the blood that are already known to be risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease. The development of an early risk assessment for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) means clinicians could intervene early when treatment would be most effective. Alzheimer's disease rates are expected to soar as baby boomers become the largest segment of the US population, making treatment and management of AD a focus of researchers. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease that affects 35.6 million people worldwide. The disease is expected to strike 115.4 million people by 2050. Thee study's corresponding author Howard J. Federoff, MD, PhD, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center suggests most drugs that are prescribed for AD are given too late in the disease process, which is why they fail. Identifying those at risk early would mean new approaches to managing Alzheimer's disease. )""The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,"" Federoff said in a press release. ""Biomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics.""All of the drugs developed have failed for Alzheimer's disease. Federoff explains biomarkers for the disease have been developed for the first time that can be used to help identify people at risk for Alzheimer's disease that could in turn help delay the onset of symptoms.

 Lipids thought to destroy brain cells
The scientists are developing a clinical trial to further validate the preliminary findings. The 10 lipids used in the testing are known to break down neural cells in the brain that can lead to memory loss. 
For their study, the researchers tested 525 healthy participants aged 70 or beyond whose blood was tested at the study's start and periodically throughout the 5-year investigation. 
Forty-six of the participants were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment on enrollment. During the course of the study 28 people were diagnosed with either mild Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
The lipid biomarkers were identified in the third year of the study by matching 53 study participants with mild memory loss, 18 of whom developed cognitive impairment during the study (converters), to 53 people with normal memory as a control. 
To further validate the findings, the researchers tested the remaining 21 with memory impairment, 10 of whom were converters and 20 controls. The scientists then tested whether the blood test could be used to identify people who would develop Alzheimer's disease. 
""The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 percent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,"" Federoff says.
Federoff says the blood test is a ""major step forward"" for commercializing a test that could screen large numbers of people for Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials take years. The blood test won't hit the market anytime soon. There are also questions about whether or not people would want to know their risk for the AD. So far the test is 90 percent accurate, meaning some people could be falsely diagnosed.

219	"Highlight PressBreaking Tech News, Entertainment, Mortgages and MoreMarch 11, 2014 By Meredith Hoster Scientists discover new method for using blood biomarker readings to predict if a person will develop dementia in less than three years – initial tests prove 90% accurate.A new test has been devised to predict with a 90% degree of accuracy whether a person is likely to develop Alzheimer’s Disease within three years. Researchers discovered the way in which the earliest traces of the condition affect a number of biomarkers within the blood, which can be examined and used to determine will or will not develop dementia imminent.It is hoped that the discovery will buy both Alzheimer’s patients and their doctors more time in the very earliest stages of the disease to use therapy techniques proven to slow the onset of the debilitating condition, or ideally avoid its development altogether.Over the course of five years, a group of 525 individuals aged 70 years and upwards were studied by a team from the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington DC. When the study reached the halfway point, blood samples were taken and analyzed from 53 of the participants who had been diagnosed with a form of dementia, in order to compare these with samples from a group of unaffected individuals.The results were surprising – by looking a the blood’s biomarkers it became clear that prediction of the onset of Alzheimer’s was as accurate at 90%. Withe upward of 35 million people living with disease on a global basis, doctors and researchers have made slowing or preventing the onset of dementia a firm priority.“We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals,” said Professor Howard Federoff, an author of the study.However, the team was also clear in pointing out that the research is still in its early days and the new discovery will for the time being be used only as a basis for further research.

They showed that testing levels of 10 fats in the blood could predict - with 90% accuracy - the risk of the disease coming on in the next three years.Their findings, published in Nature Medicine, will now be tested in larger clinical trials.Experts said the results needed to be confirmed, but such a test would be ""a real step forward"".The number of people living with dementia stands at 44 million around the globe and is expected to treble by 2050. The disease silently attacks the brain for more than a decade before any symptoms emerge. Doctors think drug trials are failing because patients are simply being treated too late to make a difference.This is why discovering a test that predicts the risk of dementia is a major priority for the field.Scientists at Georgetown University in Washington DC analysed blood samples from 525 people over the age of 70 as part of a five-year study.They took 53 of them who developed Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment and compared their blood with 53 who stayed mentally agile.They found differences in the levels of 10 lipids, or fats, between the two groups. And when the research team looked in the other blood samples, those 10 markers of Alzheimer's could predict who was likely to enter mental decline in the following years. Howard Federoff, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center, told the BBC: ""I think there is a huge need for a test.""But we must look at larger numbers of people before this could be used in clinical practice.""The full power of the test has not been investigated either. So far they know a diagnosis of dementia can be predicted three years ahead of time, but the researchers are now investigating whether the test works even earlier. It is not clear exactly what is causing the change in fats in the blood, but it could be a residue of the early changes in the brain. A successful test for Alzheimer's could transform medical research and treatment drugs could be tested at a much earlier stage in the disease. Prof Federoff said slowing the pace of the disease could have a huge impact: ""Even a short delay of symptoms will have a tremendous economic benefit just in terms of the cost of care.""Dr Simon Ridley, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said the findings were ""encouraging"" and that a blood test would be a ""real step forward"".World dementia cases 'set to treble'The dementia timebombHe added: ""To test the effectiveness of potential new drugs, it's important to be able to recruit people to clinical trials in the early stages of the disease, when such treatments are most likely to be effective. ""If confirmed, these results could also aid efforts to develop better tools for diagnosing Alzheimer's - allowing people with the disease to access crucial support and existing treatments sooner.""The Alzheimer's Society's Dr Doug Brown said the test needed to be investigated further, but could pose ethical challenges.""If this does develop in the future people must be given a choice about whether they would want to know, and fully understand the implications.""The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesThe US president rejects ""false rumours"" of differences, insisting he and Theresa May ""like each other a lot"".

It may be an important step toward new treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s at an earlier stage, when therapy would be more effective at slowing or preventing symptoms. The study, led by researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center, will be published in April issue of Nature Medicine. Over the course of the five-year study, scientists have analyzed blood samples of 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older, of which 74 participants met the criteria for either AD or aMCI (amnestic mild cognitive impairment).

Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy What if you could find out, with a relatively high degree of certainty, whether you would get Alzheimer's disease in the next few years? Would you want that information? Would the fact there is currently no cure or preventative treatment have an impact on your decision?These are some of the questions raised by a recent study that suggests a seemingly straightforward blood test might be able to predict, with 90 per cent accuracy, the onset of Alzheimer's. Over the past few days, news outlets throughout the world have hailed this research as a ""breakthrough"" that could lead to treatments that, as one article stated, could ""halt or even prevent the disease.""This is, no doubt, a potentially exciting development. The test, which measures the level of a variety of lipids in the blood, may help inform both research strategies and, one can hope, future therapies.Story continues below advertisementStill, we need to be cautious and resist the ""breakthrough"" mentality so pervasive in popular culture today. This is one study. And it is not a terribly large one. Nor is the predictive power as precise as often reported in the media (for example, the 90 per cent prediction refers to the onset of both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease – two very different outcomes). The results of the study are promising, but we need to take great care not to over-interpret or overreact.History tells us that biomarkers are often not as prognostic as suggested by early research results. Indeed, a 2012 paper by Stanford University's John Ioannidis concluded that, despite the large investment in biomarker research – such as genetics testing, body and tissue imaging and the measurement of particular chemicals in the blood – ""the yield of successful biomarkers with unquestionably favorable health impacts has been extremely limited to date."" Other work by Mr. Ioannidis has found that the predictive power of biomarkers is often exaggerated in the scientific literature, thus making it difficult for clinicians to judge their true value.So, when faced with the prospect of an exciting new test, such as this one for Alzheimer's disease, we should remind ourselves to wait for the results of methodologically rigorous studies that replicate the initial findings.Moreover, a consideration of the social and individual impact of the test needs to be weighed and investigated.First, it is unclear that the likely onset of Alzheimer's is something that all individuals would want to know, particularly since there is nothing that can be done to prevent or cure this fatal condition. While there is survey research that suggests a strong interest in this kind of technology (perhaps people will want to get things done prior to arrival of symptoms), experience with other predictive tests gives us some hint as to how the uptake might actually play out. A genetic test for Huntington's disease, for example, has been around for decades. If an individual tests positive for the relevant genetic mutation, the future development of the disease is a virtual certainty. In other words, the test is 100 per cent predictive.But despite the power of the test, only 10 to 20 per cent of individuals at risk for Huntington's – that is, individuals with a family history – actually get tested. The majority of individuals simply don't want to know what the future holds.Second, there are questions about how individuals and our health system might react to this information. Would a positive result cause anxiety and, perhaps, enduring psychological harm? Research tells us that humans are, in fact, remarkably resilient to even the most distressing news. But it seems certain that at least some individuals would struggle with the prospect of imminent cognitive decline – a fact that seems particularly salient given that there would likely be a significant number of false positives.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAnd what impact might a test of this nature have on our health care system? Even inexpensive tests can have significant downstream costs.Alzheimer's disease is devastating. It is understandable that news of a noteworthy advance would result in hopeful headlines and predictions of near future application. Indeed, I too am hopeful that research of this nature will lead to effective tests, preventive strategies and, even, treatments.But the announcement of and reaction to this study also highlights the need for caution in the interpretation of results, carefully executed replication studies and a consideration of the cascade of individual and social costs so often associated with potentially powerful medical advances.There is a lot at stake.

He and his colleagues already are designing a clinical trial that would use the lipid panel to test a therapeutic agent, he noted. Confirmation of the results and further testing are needed before the blood test could be offered to the general public. However, the breakthrough raises questions about the benefits of receiving a diagnosis of Alzheimer's prior to the onset of symptoms and without any proven preventive therapy, some observers have noted. There may not be much upside to screening for dementia, prior research has suggested.The findings appear in Nature Medicine.Golden Living Centers is fighting an arbitration ruling that found the company owes $1.8 million in vacation pay to 2,000 former employees at 36 Pennsylvania nursing homes.The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that it has reached a settlement with long-term care pharmacy provider Omnicare Inc., ending an investigation into whether the company violated an anti-discrimination rule included in the Immigration and Nationality Act.A certified nursing assistant was charged with aggravated battery and resisting arrest after she allegedly hit her former boss with a car last week.McKnight's Long-Term Care NewsCopyright © 2016 Haymarket Media, Inc.

226	A new blood test developed by scientists from Georgetown University in Washington DC is capable of predicting onset of Alzheimer's with 96 per cent certainty three years in advance—and that figure could soon stretch to decades.The researchers report their new test in Nature Medicine, explaining that it identifies 10 chemicals in the blood which are associated with the disease. While tests already exist to diagnose the condition, this is the first to predict its onset.The test was developed using a group of 525 people aged 70 and over, who initially showed no signs of mental impairment. They were given cognitive tests over a five year period, and also had blood samples taken. Over the five years, 28 developed Alzheimer's—enough to identify the 10 chemicals which indicated the presence of the disease.In subsequent trials, the presence of those chemicals in blood samples has been used to predict the onset of Alzheimer's within three years, with up to 96 per cent certainty. The next step is to make the test even more sensitive—and the researchers hope that it could then be used to predict the onset of the disease 10 or 20 years in advance.The only question then is: would you actually want to know?

There is no cure, but this simple test could lead to other diagnostic tools.""Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,"" said Dr. Howard J. Federoff, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center, in a statement.Researchers took blood samples from 525 healthy participants over 70 years of age, and found that 74 of them developed Alzheimer's disease (AD) or another disease, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory loss is prominent. Also, unbeknownst to the study's team, they would discover the 10 lipids, or fats, that determine the onset of these cognitive diseases. They found that these fats reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or AD.The APOE4 gene is also a known risk factor for developing Alzheimer's, and was investigated in the study. But its presence had not effect, positive or negative, on the blood test. This blood test actually better predicted dementia risk than the APOE4 test alone.Currently PET scans or MRIs are used to diagnose dementia, but this new blood test is less expensive and much easier to administer.""Blood-based biomarkers would be a great and useful option -- more accessible, less invasive, easier to gather and less expensive to process,"" Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association said in a Philly report.

Scientists in the United States have developed a blood test that is able to predict whether someone will develop Alzheimer's disease. Georgetown University Medical Center researchers say they can predict whether a person will develop the disease within three years and before they show any symptoms. Knowing the chances could help you and your family to prepare, but there is still nothing you can do to stop it. The test itself is more than 90 percent accurate, and the study could also be used to design new treatments for the disease. Watch the video for the full report.

Researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center followed 525 mentally healthy seniors for several years. Some went on to develop mental impairment.

  Would you have a blood test for dementia?

  Would I? The announcement yesterday that Alzheimer's can be diagnosed with 90% certainty three years before symptoms develop didn't feel to me like a good news medical story.

  My first reaction was to be filled with dread.
Loading article content
  This malady will claim one in three of us. However, except in rare cases, it shouldn't strike before we are 70. Even then, why meet trouble half way especially as there is nothing (yet) that we can do to prevent its onset?

  Surely, I thought, it is better to travel hopefully than to seek the medical equivalent of the judge's black cap a minute sooner than necessary?

  For most of us the prospect of dementia is crueller than other terminal illnesses. It threatens us with the loss of our identity while we are still living. It threatens our families with a duty of care to someone who may be changed almost beyond recognition; someone who eventually may not recognise even their spouse or their children.

  If it is our fate, there is nothing we can do about it but practise acceptance. Acceptance is one thing. Seeking out a diagnosis before symptoms show is something else.

  And yet Alzheimer charities welcomed the news. So I tried to put aside my knee-jerk first reaction and set about reading more. Would it change my mind?

  In Scotland only 64% of dementia sufferers have a diagnosis. That figure is much higher than parts of England where it is as low as one-third in some places. The charities want to see the figures high because diagnosis is a gateway to support, information and possible treatments.

  In Scotland each sufferer receives post-diagnostic support, co-ordinated by a link worker, for a minimum of a year. Each health board now has a dementia nurse consultant. Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil said at the time of the announcement in 2012: ""This is a world first commitment and will lead to significant improvements in the ability of people to live well with dementia for as long as possible.""

  And therein lies the rub: for as long as possible. At the moment there is no cure.

  As things stand, there is eight times more money spent on cancer research than on dementia. This is partly because dementia is vastly under-reported as a cause of death. A study in America followed 2566 people over eight years, giving them an annual dementia test. It then confirmed with an autopsy how many died from Alzheimer's. Their findings were five-to-six times higher than those recorded in the general population.

  As well as poor diagnosis, a tendency to record conditions such as pneumonia as the cause of death masks the true extent of the challenge dementia poses.

  Globally, the figure for dementia of all sorts stands at 44 million sufferers. By 2050, that is predicted to rise to 135 million, of whom three-quarters will be poor or in the middle-income bracket. More than half will have Alzheimer's.

  That adds up to a colossal economic headache for governments. It is this economic imperative - rather than sentiment - that is fuelling the interest of the G8 nations.

  Scotland is estimated to have 61,000 people suffering various forms of dementia, of whom around 33,500 have Alzheimer's. We are an ageing population so those numbers too will inexorably rise.

  Even a short delaying of symptoms offers important benefits in sparing suffering and in terms of cost of care.

  That is one reason to seek the earliest possible diagnosis; one reason to welcome a predictive test. Another is that drug treatment could be trialled at a much earlier stage in the disease.

  Whether you or I decide to have the test at the moment is, fortunately, academic. More research work will need to be done before it becomes generally available. The breakthrough study by Georgetown University in Washington was small. Researchers followed 525 healthy men and women aged over 70 for five years. They analysed blood samples from 53 who developed dementia against 53 who remained cognitively normal. Biomarkers in the blood predicted with 90% accuracy those who developed Alzheimer's disease.

  A larger clinical trial will be needed. But, if the findings are replicated with larger numbers, a blood test for all is just a matter of time. It has clear advantages from the point of clinical research. The earlier the disease can be detected, the better we will understand its causes and the more chance there will be of finding better treatments; perhaps, even a means of preventing its onset, or a cure.

  On the other hand, when the test becomes available and before the discovery of a cure, many thousands might be sentenced to three extra years of fearful suffering. Certainly, they will have time to make financial decisions, organize a will, communicate with their loved ones and decide on their future care.

  They will have time to see and do what is important to them before the nerve cells in their temporal lobes start to die.

  Or maybe they won't. Might they be so overwhelmed by the prospect facing them that they are unable to enjoy the healthy life they have left? I wonder.

  Once we are able to take the test, will it remain voluntary? The health costs of the diagnosis are high so will insurance companies make the test a prerequisite of taking out a policy?

  Another worry: it has a 10% inaccuracy rate. What if we were to get a false prediction? Would those of us of an imaginative bent develop imaginary symptoms? Might some become suicidal? There is a sense here that we might be offered more knowledge than we can bear.

  The drugs currently available work best if given early. They can reduce symptoms but do not slow the disease's progression. However, the Americans plan a further study in which people at high risk of developing the disease will be offered experimental treatments which, it is hoped, will delay or prevent the disease.

  We can hope and pray for a breakthrough before the blood test becomes available. But if that does not happen so neatly, on reflection I think I would take the test despite my fears. I would take it because it would seem self-centred to a fault to decline it while knowing that the wider the knowledge base, the greater the research material, the better the possibility of treatment, of prevention. The more of us who have the blood test when it is available, the quicker that will come about.

  Yes, I know I might have to spend three years confronting a fate I would shrink from. But along the way I'll have the small but comforting consolation that, for once, I've done the right thing. If I'm unfortunate enough to be told my test is positive I will keep it to myself. It's not a burden I would wish my family to share or to see any of them make decisions about their lives in preparation for my decline. I will instead cling to the hope that I am one of the 10% who was wrongly diagnosed.

THE Alzheimer Society of Ireland has raised serious ethical and moral issues about a new blood test to detect those likely to suffer from the condition.
The Society says that while it welcomes the new findings, there are serious issues to be confronted.Its chief executive, Gerry Martin, said: ""There currently is no blood test available in Ireland which is able to predict the risk of someone developing Alzheimer's or dementia in the future.""While the Alzheimer Society of Ireland believes that early intervention is an important step in managing dementia, having an early detection test does raise ethical concerns.""He warned that people should be given a choice as to whether they wanted to know if they had a heightened risk of getting the disease.And he stressed ""they should fully understand the outcome of such a test"".Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the UK Alzheimer's Society, agreed.He said: ""Having such a test would be an interesting development, but it also throws up ethical considerations.""The latest research claims a blood test can detect the disease three years before the patient develops symptoms of memory loss.It could eventually lead to widespread screening in middle-age to identify those most at risk, and give them greater warning of their likelihood of developing the disease.It may also prompt new research into the causes of the conditions and its treatment.DRAMATICMedical experts point out that even being able to delay the onset of the debilitating condition would have a dramatic improvement on the lives of those affected.The study, published by 'Nature' magazine identified 10 molecules in the blood which could be used to predict with 90pc accuracy those who are at increased risk of dementia within a few years.It is the first investigation of its kind to highlight blood differences between those who have pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease – but who have not as yet developed any symptoms – and others who will not go on to develop the condition.Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre in the US examined 525 healthy participants aged 70 and over, and monitored them for five years.Mid-way through the re- search, the authors analysed 53 patients who already had one of the conditions and 53 ""cognitively normal"" people.They discovered 10 molecules which appeared to reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease.

It could provide an early warning about a person’s risks and the possibility of early intervention. The Alzheimer Society of Ireland has welcomed the research, saying the test would help with early treatment. However, it also raised serious ethical issues, said its chief executive officer Gerry Martin.The research team from Georgetown University medical centre used 10 “biomarkers” in the blood to predict with 90 per cent accuracy whether subjects were at risk for Alzheimer’s. The team used 525 healthy non-symptomatic participants aged 70 and older and monitored them over five years. It published its findings in the current issue of Nature Medicine . The test measures 10 fat compounds called phospholipids in the cell walls. “There are no cures or disease-modifying therapies, and this may be due to our inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to produce evident memory loss and functional decline. “It [the test] means preventative drugs could be given early,” the authors write in their paper. “There could be major treatment advantages associated with early diagnosis. ”The condition currently affects more than 35 million worldwide. In Ireland there are some 35,000 with the disease.The Alzheimer Society of Ireland welcomed the work, saying early intervention was an important step in managing dementia.

242	"NEW YORK(CBSNewYork) — A test that can predict who is going to develop Alzheimer’s Disease is being hailed as a medical breakthrough.As CBS 2’s Dr. Max Gomez reported, the test has boasted an incredible accuracy rate but is not without controversy.Other tests have been used to predict the disease including school exam style tests and a test that looks for certain bio-markers in spinal fluid and requires a spinal tap.The newest test is a blood test that can reportedly predict who will get Alzheimer’s several years before symptoms appear.Researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center followed 525 apparently mentally healthy seniors for several years.

Researchers out of Georgetown University Medical Centre have discovered a blood test that can predict whether a healthy person will develop dementia or Alzheimer’s disease within 3 years.“Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their family and physicians manage their disorder,” the study’s author, Dr. Howard Federoff explains.After following 525 healthy seniors over 5 years, researchers tested patients who went on to developed mild cognitive problems and found they shared similar biomarkers.“There was a small number of circulating blood fats, lipids, which were able to predict whether cognitively normal individuals would go on to develop impairments,” says Federoff.Researchers believe the test could be ready for use in clinical studies in as little as two years.Advocates with the Alzheimer’s Society of Calgary say the discovery should give families hope.“The medications we have available right now do not stop or cure the disease. They just give a little more time for the person to maintain their level of function,” explains Padma Genesh, the Society’s learning specialist. “If this works out, it’s an opportunity for people to try these medications at the very early stage even before the person starts experiencing symptoms.”Dr. Federoff says early detection could also help scientists develop new therapies.“There have been many efforts to develop drugs that were thought to modify the history of alzheimer’s disease and sadly all of them have failed,” he explains. “One of the reasons for this may be that the stage in which they were evaluated, – which is in patients who already have the disease – may be the wrong stage.”Federoff’s team is now designing a follow up study, in which those who have tested as high risk to develop dementia will be given experimental treatments that may delay or prevent the condition.This research was published in the March 9, 2014 online edition of Nature Medicine (link: http://www.nature.com/news/biomarkers-could-predict-alzheimer-s-before-it-starts-1.14834)

A simple blood test that a researcher calls a “game changer”Â may be able to accurately predict whether older adults will develop dementia.The experimental test, developed by researchers at six universities, was 90 percent accurate at predicting whether adults age 70 and older would develop either mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s within two to three years. The study was published online Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine.The test measures the levels of 10 lipids, or fats, in the bloodstream. Low levels signal a person is likely to suffer cognitive impairment, said researchers with Georgetown University, one of the medical centers involved in the research.>>Â Sign up for the AARP Health NewsletterLead researcher Howard Federoff, M.D., Executive Vice President for Health Sciences at Georgetown, told NPRÂ the test would be an easy way for older people to determine their risk of dementia, and would be a “game changer”Â if researchers can find a drug to slow down or cure the disease.The idea, he said, is to identify those at risk early, when treatment might be more effective at protecting the brain, rather than waiting until the damage is already underway.The new study involved 525 healthy adults age 70 and over who were given blood tests annually for five years. During those years, 74 developed mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s. Researchers then compared their blood with those who remained mentally healthy to see what was different. What they found was the dementia group had lower levels of a group of 10 lipids than did the healthy group.To measure the accuracy of these lipids at predicting dementia, researchers then tested a second group of 40 people. They even added a genetic test that looks for a mutant gene linked to Alzheimer’s. The blood test predicted dementia with better accuracy than the gene test alone, researchers reported.A simple, accurate way to identify those at risk for dementia – along with an effective treatment to do something about the disease – is even more urgent today as the population ages. Alzheimer’s currently affects about 5 million Americans, and a recent study estimates that it kills more than 500,000 a year, six times more than previously thought.>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.Although this blood test is still experimental and not ready to use on patients, it’s an important step toward finding “a relatively inexpensive and noninvasive biomarker to allow us to screen large groups of people,” Ronald Petersen, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, told NBC News.A blood test would certainly be easier to administer than current tests for identifying early Alzheimer’s, agreed Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer’s Association, but further trials are needed “in larger and more diverse populations,”Â she told HealthDay.Despite the test’s seemingly dramatic results, the study found only an association between low levels of the 10 fats and developing dementia, not proof of cause and effect.Even Federoff acknowledged that researchers don’t know why all 10 lipids are lower in individuals who are predisposed to cognitive impairment. “We can’t directly link this to our current understanding”Â of Alzheimer’s disease, he said.Photo: jeangill/iStock    Also of Interest See theÂ AARP home pageÂ for deals, savings tips, trivia and more Tagged: Alzheimers, BH, Blood test, Candy Sagon, cognitive decline, dementia, HB, mental decline, mental health

Comments: (0)Tell-a-FriendMONDAY, March 10, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- A blood test has been developed that can predict with 90 percent certainty whether a senior will suffer from dementia such as Alzheimer's disease within the next few years, according to a study published online March 9 in Nature Medicine. The test relies on levels of 10 lipids in the bloodstream to estimate the chances of either mild cognitive impairment or the beginnings of Alzheimer's disease.
The study involved 525 healthy people aged 70 or older who underwent a full blood exam and a battery of neurocognitive tests. The research team then followed the participants for five years. During the course of the study, 74 of the people developed dementia or mild Alzheimer's disease. Researchers compared their blood to the blood of people who showed no signs of cognitive decline. They found that people who later developed dementia started out with low levels of a series of 10 lipids, compared to the other study participants. They then performed a second study in which they tested the predictive power of the 10-lipid review on a separate group of 40 people.
The accuracy of the blood test neither improved nor diminished when researchers added a genetic test looking for a mutant version of the APOE gene that has been linked to Alzheimer's. In fact, they found the blood test predicted dementia with better accuracy than the APOE test alone.
""The results, while intriguing, are preliminary,"" Maria Carrillo, Ph.D., vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association, told HealthDay. ""They require replication and validation by other scientists in larger and more diverse populations to give them credibility, before further development for clinical use is warranted.""

250	"Alzheimer’s is characterized by a toxic buildup of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain. This buildup destroys neurons. Several blood tests that can diagnose the disease already exist, but they aren't sensitive enough to predict the disease's onset.A new study, published in the journal Nature Medicine and conducted by Howard Federoff and colleagues at Georgetown University, evaluated 525 people aged 70 and over for five years. At the onset of the study, the group did not show any signs of mental impairment. Each year of the study, the researchers conducted a detailed cognitive examination and took blood samples from all the participants.During this time, 28 people developed Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment, which is considered to be the earliest noticeable sign of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.Related News: Vitamin E May Slow the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease »An analysis of the participants' blood highlighted 10 metabolites that were depleted in people who had mild cognitive impairment and who went on to develop Alzheimer's, compared with those who didn't. In subsequent trials, the researchers showed that measuring these chemicals could predict who would develop Alzheimer's within the next three years, with up to 96 percent accuracy.Commenting on the fact that the 10 metabolites play a key role in supporting cell membranes, maintaining neurons, or sustaining energy processes, Mark Mapstone, one of the researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said, ""We think the decrease in these chemicals reflects the breakdown of neural populations in the brain.""Learn More: What Are the Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease? »Once the test is confirmed in a larger study group, it may offer an inexpensive and fast way of predicting Alzheimer's. What’s more, the test may even be able to predict the disease well in advance of onset. According to Mapstone, these metabolic changes in the brain might occur up to 20 years before symptoms appear.The research team is planning to look back at other dementia studies in which blood has been taken over decades, to see whether the chemical changes can be detected that early.Related News: Hearing Loss Leads to Brain Tissue Loss in Older Adults »Since there are currently no treatments available, it’s anyone’s guess whether people will want to take a blood test to learn that they are likely to develop Alzheimer’s. Gladstone believes that if people in their early 40s find out, they could make a habit of eating the right foods, avoiding head trauma, and participating in more exercise in order to slow the disease's onset.Also, people who know that they are at risk may benefit by getting their affairs in order, planning for future care, and helping loved ones prepare.Commenting on the new blood test, Maria Carrillo, Ph.D., the Alzheimer’s Association's vice president of medical and scientific relations, said, “The Alzheimer’s disease field needs methods to detect and diagnose Alzheimer’s at its earliest time point in order to allow earlier intervention with new treatments and future potential prevention strategies."" (Carrillo was not involved in this study.)Carrillo added that current biological markers for early disease, including levels of abnormal proteins in cerebrospinal fluid, structural and functional MRI of the brain, and brain PET amyloid imaging, are limited by their inability to specifically diagnose (“rule in”) the disease, or because they are invasive and can be expensive. “Blood-based biomarkers would be a great and useful option—more accessible, less invasive, easier to gather and less expensive to process. Several are under development for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. More research investment in this area is urgently needed,” she said.See How It Works: A Map of the Human Brain »Emphasizing that the research results, while intriguing, are preliminary, Carrillo said, “We are in the early days of discovery in this area of Alzheimer's research.

WASHINGTON - Researchers at Georgetown University announced the discovery of a blood test that can predict whether a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease or a related condition within three years.Their study, described Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine, identifies 10 lipids in the blood that predict onset of the disease. Researchers tested the blood of 525 people age 70 and older over five years, 74 of whom either began the study meeting the criteria or later developed the criteria for mild Alzheimer’s disease or a memory loss condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment that is often a precursor to Alzheimer’s. Among those who developed the disease, the researchers discovered the presence of 10 lipids that were abnormal and that predicted with more than 90 percent accuracy the onset of the disease.They plan to expand the study by looking at larger longitudinal studies to see whether these lipids were present in the blood of patients in those studies who later developed the disease, said Howard Federoff, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center, who led the study. If so, he said, they would move on to clinical trials.“We want to look back on when they were asymptomatic and see if these lipids were present,” he said, adding that a larger study would offer greater range in terms of patients’ age and racial diversity.There is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which afflicts more than 5 million Americans and 35.6 million people worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists Alzheimer’s as the sixth-leading cause of death, but recent research ranks it as the third-biggest killer in the United States. The numbers of those affected are expected to nearly triple by 2050 if there are no significant medical breakthroughs.A large field of research is currently looking at indicators for Alzheimer’s in blood and cerebral spinal fluid. It would probably be several years before a test for the lipids identified in this study could be ordered by a physician.“Developing tests that ultimately become ones that your doctor can order is not a straightforward process,” Federoff said, noting that some patients may ultimately prefer not to know they are likely to develop the disease because there is no treatment.But the presence of such a test could help researchers identify people at high risk and design a clinical trial to determine whether a drug could delay or prevent the onset of symptoms, he said.Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer’s Association, called the Georgetown test intriguing, but cautioned that it was preliminary.“It would need to be further developed,” she said. Snyder added that even without available treatments, such a test could allow patients to “plan their care future, their financial future, to communicate with caregivers and friends, and to participate in a clinical trial as a chance to change the future for others with Alzheimer’s disease.”Research on indicators in cerebral spinal fluid, while further along in development than blood tests, are also still not ready for widespread diagnosis or prediction of the disease, Snyder said.©2018, The Dallas Morning News Inc.

252	Headlines on Monday have been touting the promise of a new blood test for Alzheimer’s disease —a simple, non-invasive way to detect the condition before symptoms occur. It measures levels of 10 lipids or fats circulating in the blood, and a study of 525 healthy seniors found that it could predict within 90 percent accuracy whether they would go on to develop memory loss or other symptoms five years later, according to the study published in Nature Medicine.This could be a potentially huge development given that half a million Americans are estimated to die from Alzheimer’s disease every year, according to a study published last week in the journal Neurology.But “potential” is the operative word here. “We are certainly getting closer to having a blood test for Alzheimer’s, which I thought was impossible five years ago,” said Dr. Robert Stern, director of clinical research of the Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Center. “But I predict it will take another five or ten years for one to become available.”Likely, he said, the lipid measurement will just one marker assessed in a blood test to measure various markers for the disease—similar to the way doctors measure various components of cholesterol and inflammatory markers to screen for heart disease. It could, for example, be combined with another blood test developed by Australian researchers last year that also appears to predict Alzheimer’s disease by measuring different biomarkers.(These are distinct from genetic tests already available to screen for mutations that predict hereditary Alzheimer’s disease.)The drive to develop a cheap, easy way to screen for Alzheimer’s has been getting more urgent as evidence builds to suggest that patients likely benefit most from treatments at the first subtle sign of memory loss or even years before they develop symptoms.“Drugs need to be used very early in the disease before there’s too much destruction of brain tissue,” Stern said. “By the time symptoms develop, the destruction is usually irreversible.”Research suggests more than 50 percent of brain cells crucial to memory retention and cognitive processing are lost by the time a patient begins to develop personality changes and impaired memory.Three clinical trials are getting underway to test experimental drugs designed to clear or prevent the formation of amyloid plaques thought to be involved in the destruction of brain cells in Alzheimer’s disease patients. For example, researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and elsewhere are enrolling 3,000 healthy volunteers ages 65 to 85 in a trial to test an amyloid-clearing drug called solanezumab.“We’re looking for older people with no symptoms or perhaps subtle memory concerns who aren’t at the stage where they would go to the doctor for an evaluation,” said study investigator Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the Brigham’s Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment. Potential participants in the study, called A4, will first take a cognitive test, and those who fall in the “normal” range for their age will be given a brain imaging scan using positron emission tomography  (PET) to check for the presence of amyloid plaques.Those who have amyloid plaques will then be randomly assigned to take solanezumab, an antibody that targets amyloid plaque, or a placebo to see if the drug works better than a sugar pill to prevent the onset of memory loss and other cognitive symptoms.PET brain scans tend to be used only in the research setting since the $5,000 cost per scan isn’t covered by the federal government’s Medicare insurance plan.Both Sperling and Stern agreed that the new experimental blood test was promising and likely a small step of many that will need to be taken before a blood test will be available for clinical use.“It’s important that this test can predict memory loss, but can it also detect amyloid formation before the development of any symptoms?” Sperling said. She and her research team plan to make blood samples and PET scans collected during the study available to outside researchers developing screening blood tests to help speed their development. “We’re in a Catch-22 at the moment,” Stern said. “In order for us to develop really good modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s, we need to identify people very early on in the course of the disease. But we still don’t have a cheap and easy way to do that.” © 2018 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC	Health
253	A new study is generating hope — and international attention — that a simple blood test may be able to determine who will develop Alzheimer’s disease.The test would be a major milestone because current methods of detecting the progressive neurological affliction are expensive and invasive. A relatively low-tech alternative like a blood test has the potential to expand the number of people who could participate in the clinical trials necessary to create new Alzheimer’s drugs and therapies.But the goal of better research is tempered by some concern, especially among medical ethicists, that predicting the onset of such a devastating disease in specific patients could be harmful without an effective treatment — something not available yet.The study, published online Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine, was conducted by researchers at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and the University of Rochester in New York. It found low levels of certain lipid fats in the blood of 28 seniors, all age 70 or older, who developed Alzheimer’s or its precursor, mild cognitive impairment. About 500 seniors who did not show signs of the disease had normal to high levels of those lipids.Looking for these 10 markers, then, could provide an early warning of who is on the path to developing Alzheimer’s — the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and likely to grow as baby boomers age. By comparing the blood samples of people with the disease and those who are unaffected, the researchers believe scientists and doctors can predict onset “within a two- to three-year time frame with over 90 percent accuracy.”Dr. Mark Mapstone, the paper’s lead author, said Monday that the public should not expect to start getting blood tests for Alzheimer’s anytime soon. He said more research is needed to verify that the initial results are valid — and whether the analysis can be effective for people in their 40s and 50s. Earlier detection could enable patients and their health providers to have more options for preventing, halting or slowing the disease.“We think that the value of this screening method, right now, is for research. By no means do we feel this should be something out there being used to screen patients at the clinic,” Mapstone said.Alzheimer’s is a form of dementia, and Mapstone said he does not know if the 10 markers isolated in his team’s study could be used to predict other types of memory loss.Still, the blood-test announcement is getting lots of attention from the Alzheimer’s research community and from a public eager for any bit of news that points to progress in vanquishing a scourge that robs millions of their most precious memories.Dr. Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study at UC San Diego, said Mapstone and his colleagues have made a notable discovery.“It is very interesting and, potentially, very important,” he said. “But it is important to note that it has to be evaluated in different populations so that we have some confidence in its utility. There have been many predictive markers developed for Alzheimer’s over the years that have not stood the test of time.”Developed in 1991, Aisen’s group at UC San Diego works with the National Institute on Aging to conduct Alzheimer’s studies nationwide. Since its inception, it has conducted 23 Alzheimer’s drug studies, including an ongoing trial to test solanezumab, a compound that attacks a protein called amyloid beta which is believed to interfere in brain cell function. Having a cheap way to detect Alzheimer’s in its formative stages, Aisen said, would give researchers a way to do studies of much larger populations than is currently possible with existing technology.But a test that can predict with near certainty who will develop the disease also comes with a set of complex moral questions.Though researchers such as Mapstone and Aisen would not condone widespread use of such a test on patients until effective treatments have been developed, Lawrence Hinman, a professor of philosophy at the University of San Diego, noted that commerce often goes its own way.He said if a company were to make and sell a test based on this new research, it could have devastating effects on people who are unprepared to receive the diagnosis.“I would be particularly concerned with the way in which this would impact a person’s view of themselves as well as other people’s view of them,” Hinman said. “When someone receives this kind of news, you certainly would like to see the support services beyond just notification.”Mapstone said while it is technically possible for a commercial company to use the research as a jumping-off point to make a blood test, both Georgetown and the University of Rochester have taken steps to make sure they don’t simply crib the 10 markers listed in the paper.“The institutions have applied for patents on these biomarkers,” Mapstone said.Meanwhile, there is still much work to do in the laboratory.The five-year study collected blood samples from 525 people age 70 or older. One hundred of them were recruited in Irvine and the balance came from Rochester. All were subject to memory testing at the beginning of the study and 46 were found to already meet the criteria for Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment and were excluded from comparison.Mapstone said that, because there were only 28, out of more than 500, who were diagnosed during the study period, it will be necessary to test many more people from different backgrounds to see if the 10 lipids are still predictive.“Our subjects were primarily Caucasians of middle to upper income and with higher levels of education,” Mapstone said. “We need to get more diversity in terms of race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.”Rather than run a whole new five-year study with many more participants, the researcher said the preferred method for moving forward and validating the initial results is to do what’s called a retrospective study that examines blood samples given to other labs for other studies. Mapstone said he has already been contacted by many researchers who have volunteered samples that might help get the job done.“Now this whole thing has to stand up to the rigor of somebody else’s lab showing the same thing, and we’re cautiously optimistic that it will,” Mapstone said.

261	"by Katie BrookeLynchburg, VA- Researchers have developed a test to figure out who is mostat risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. This test is reportedly 90 percent accurate. A study released in early March said Alzheimer's disease has claimed the lives nearly half a millionAmericans so this test could be life altering.Here's how the test works: A person would get a blood test from theirdoctor that would tell them whether or not they could develop the disease. Researchers have developed a test that looks for ten substances in the bloodknown as cell membrane lipids. They believe these substances may be connected to the breakdown of certaincells in the brain and they find that people who have lower levels of thesesubstances are more likely to develop mental decline within three years. So if they can test for these substances, they can find out if a person isat risk. People were all over the spectrum when asked if they'd get the test.""I just think as we get older and age you know it's probably a goodthing to remember,"" said one person.""No I would not because I'm terrified of needles,"" was theresponse another person gave.""Probably not,"" said another.""Absolutely, I'd love to know what the future may have in store andhopefully it could be a preventative type thing,"" was another answergiven.

Federoff, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center and the study's corresponding author, said in a news release.Federoff explained there have been many attempts to develop drugs that slow or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease, but all of them have so far failed. He suggested such drugs were evaluated too late in the progression of the disease.On the other hand, ""the preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,"" he said.The study included 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older who gave blood samples at various points through in the experimenting process.Over a five-year period, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer's disease or a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment, where memory loss is prominent.Out of that 74 study subjects identified with elevated Alzheimer's risks, 46 were diagnosed upon enrollment and 28 developed memory-loss or symptoms associated with the milder form of the disease.In the study's third year, researchers selected 53 participants who had developed cognitive dysfunctions and  53 cognitively-normal matched participants and again drew blood sample to check for differences in the two groups.That's when the research group discovered the 10 lipids said to have shown the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who developed symptoms of the disease.""The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 percent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress ... within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,"" Federoff said. ""We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals.Federoff added that he and his team are already working on the next logical step in their work:  designing a clinical trial ""to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer's to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease."" immmigrants sanctuary city Business is booming for Latino entrepreneurs, especially in Southern California, where the growth in the number of Hispanic-owned businesses (HOBs) has bloomed despite the recession and tough economic recovery.

265	Researchers at Georgetown University announced the discovery of a blood test that can predict whether a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease or a related condition within three years.Their study, described Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine, identifies 10 lipids in the blood that predict onset of the disease. Researchers tested the blood of 525 people age 70 and older over five years, 74 of whom either began the study meeting the criteria or later developed the criteria for mild Alzheimer’s disease or a memory loss condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment that is often a precursor to Alzheimer’s. Among those who developed the disease, the researchers discovered the presence of 10 lipids that were abnormal and that predicted with more than 90 percent accuracy the onset of the disease.They plan to expand the study by looking at larger longitudinal studies to see whether these lipids were present in the blood of patients in those studies who later developed the disease, said Howard J. Federoff, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center, who led the study. If so, he said, they would move on to clinical trials.“We want to look back on when they were asymptomatic and see if these lipids were present,” he said, adding that a larger study would offer greater range in terms of patients’ age and racial diversity.There is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which afflicts more than 5 million Americans and 35.6 million people worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists Alzheimer’s as the sixth-leading cause of death, but recent research ranks it as the third-biggest killer in the United States. The numbers of those affected are expected to nearly triple by 2050 if there are no significant medical breakthroughs.A large field of research is currently looking at indicators for Alzheimer’s in blood and cerebral spinal fluid. It would probably be several years before a test for the lipids identified in this study could be ordered by a physician.“Developing tests that ultimately become ones that your doctor can order is not a straightforward process,” Federoff said, noting that some patients may ultimately prefer not to know they are likely to develop the disease because there is no treatment.But the presence of such a test could help researchers identify people at high risk and design a clinical trial to determine whether a drug could delay or prevent the onset of symptoms, he said.Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer’s Association, called the Georgetown test intriguing, but cautioned that it was preliminary.“It would need to be further developed,” she said. Snyder added that even without available treatments, such a test could allow patients to “plan their care future, their financial future, to communicate with caregivers and friends, and to participate in a clinical trial as a chance to change the future for others with Alzheimer’s disease.” Research on indicators in cerebral spinal fluid, while further along in development than blood tests, are also still not ready for widespread diagnosis or prediction of the disease, Snyder said.

267	"An experimental blood test can identify people in their 70s who are likely to develop Alzheimer's disease within two or three years. The test is accurate more than 90 percent of the time, scientists reported Sunday in Nature Medicine. The finding could lead to a quick and easy way for seniors to assess their risk of Alzheimer's, says Dr. Howard Federoff, a professor of neurology at Georgetown University. And that would be a ""game changer,"" he says, if researchers find a treatment that can slow down or stop the disease. But because there is still no way to halt Alzheimer's, Federoff says, people considering the test would have to decide whether they are prepared to get results that ""could be life-altering."" The idea of predicting Alzheimer's isn't new. It's already possible to detect signs of the disease long before symptoms like memory loss begin to appear. But the tests require either a spinal tap, which is painful, or an MRI scan, which is time consuming and expensive. So Federoff and a team of researchers set out to find something better. They took blood samples from 525 people ages 70 and older. Then, he says, they looked to see who developed Alzheimer's in the next five years. The goal was to find some difference between the blood of people who developed Alzheimer's and the blood of people who remained ""cognitively normal,"" Federoff says. And after sifting through more than 4,000 potential ""biomarkers,"" he says, ""We discovered that 10 blood lipids [fats] predicted whether someone would go on to develop cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's."" The results need to be confirmed, and the approach still needs to be tried in people of different ages and from different racial groups, Federoff says. Even so, he says, it raises the possibility that in the not too distant future, many more people will know their risk of Alzheimer's. That knowledge can be a good thing, says Dr. Jason Karlawish, a professor of medicine, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. That's been shown among people who chose to be tested for a gene that increases the risk of Alzheimer's, he says. ""Knowing their risk of developing cognitive impairment is very relevant to making plans around retirement and where they live,"" he says. ""So there is certainly a role for knowing that information."" On the other hand, people who have the Alzheimer's gene and know it tend to rate their own memories as worse than people who have the gene but don't know it, he says. Knowing you carry the gene also seems to hurt people's performance on memory tests. But the biggest concern about Alzheimer's testing probably has to do with questions of stigma and identity, Karlawish says. ""How will other people interact with you if they learn that you have this information?"" he says. ""And how will you think about your own brain and your sort of sense of self?"" The stigma and fear surrounding Alzheimer's may decrease, though, as our understanding of the disease changes, Karlawish says. Right now, people still tend to think that ""either you have Alzheimer's disease dementia or you're normal, you don't have it,"" he says. But research has shown that's not really true, Karlawish says. Alzheimer's is a bit like heart disease. It starts with biological changes that occur years before symptoms appear. And there is no bright line separating healthy people from those in early stages of the disease.View the discussion thread.

268	" (CNN) — In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have developed a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease that predicts with astonishing accuracy whether a healthy person will develop the disease.Though much work still needs to be done, it is hoped the test will someday be available in doctors’ offices, since the only methods for predicting Alzheimer’s right now, such as PET scans and spinal taps, are expensive, impractical, often unreliable and sometimes risky.“This is a potential game-changer,” said Dr. Howard Federoff, senior author of the report and a neurologist at Georgetown University Medical Center. “My level of enthusiasm is very high.”The study was published in Nature Medicine.‘We were surprised’In the beginning, the researchers knew they wanted to find a blood test to detect Alzheimer’s but didn’t know what specifically to look for. Should they examine patients’ DNA? Their RNA? Or should they look for the byproducts of DNA and RNA, such as fats and proteins?They decided to start with fats, since it was the easiest and least expensive. They drew blood from hundreds of healthy people over age 70 living near Rochester, New York, and Irvine, California. Five years later, 28 of the seniors had developed Alzheimer’s disease or the mild cognitive problems that usually precede it.Scouring more than 100 fats, or lipids, for what might set this group apart, they found that these 28 seniors had low levels of 10 particular lipids, compared with healthy seniors.To confirm their findings, the researchers then looked at the blood of 54 other patients who had Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment. This group also had low levels of the lipids.Overall, the blood test predicted who would get Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment with over 90% accuracy.“We were surprised,” said Mark Mapstone, a neuropsychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center and lead author of the study. “But it turns out that it appears we were looking in the right place.”The ‘holy grail’The beauty of this test, Mapstone says, is that it caught Alzheimer’s before the patient even had symptoms, suggesting that the disease process begins long before people’s memories start failing. He says that perhaps the lipid levels started decreasing at the same time as brain cells started dying.He and his team plan to try out this test in people in their 40s and 50s. If that works, he says, that would be the “holy grail,” because then researchers could try experimental drugs and treatments in a group that’s almost sure to get the disease. That would speed research along immensely.Plus, people could get a heads up that they were probably destined to get Alzheimer’s. Although some people might not want to know that they’re destined for a horrible disease, others might be grateful for the warning.Federoff said he would want to know whether he was on his way to getting the disease, even though there’s nothing he could do about it. He might want to take a family trip he’d been thinking about or might want to appoint a successor at work.“I would make sure that things that are important to me get done,” he said.But, Federoff added, others might not want to know they were about to get a devastating disease they were powerless to stop.“I think it’s a very personal decision,” Federoff said. “It would have to be thought through on multiple dimensions. Patients and their families would have to be counseled.”Next steps Other research teams are looking at other possible tests for Alzheimer’s. The need for a screening test of some kind for Alzheimer’s has never been greater: A report released last week says the disease claims the lives of perhaps a half a million Americans, making it nearly as deadly as heart disease and cancer.If any of these tests work out — and that’s still an if — it would take years to make it to doctors’ offices, since the test would need to be validated by other labs and with larger groups of people. Thee test developed by the Georgetown and Rochester researchers, for example, was used mainly in white people, and it might not work as well with other groups.Heather Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer’s Association, said the study was well done but much work is still needed.“It’s an interesting paper. It’s an intriguing study. But it is very preliminary,” she said.Filed in: News Topics: alzheimer's, Alzheimer's Disease Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

275	"A blood test that is very simple could potentially predict whether a person who is healthy could develop dementia symptoms within the next three years, said promising research.The blood test could fill in a big gap in the strategies to fight brain degeneration, which doctors believe does not show its symptoms until a stage when most often it is too late to effectively treat.The findings said researchers were potentially very positive as they said they are desperately in need of biomarkers that would allow the patients to first be identified and then recruited into clinical trials prior to the beginning of their symptoms.Howard Federoff a Neurologist from Georgetown University in Washington D.C. along with his team of researchers tested the memory and cognitive skills of participants and took samples of blood from them once a year over a period of five years.The test that was found to work was identified during one of the preliminary studies that involved more than 525 people all above the age of 70.The work identified a group of 10 lipid metabolites in the blood plasma of the patients that distinguished with an accuracy of 90% between those would remain healthy cognitively from those who would start to show signs of impairment cognitively over a period of time.The researchers said they did not know the actual source yet of the 10 molecules but do know they usually are present in the cell membranes, said the neurologist.The doctor emphasized that the results of the study would need to be validated through independent labs and in studies that were much larger in size. The study has been published online in the Nature Medicine journal.Healthcare officials worldwide are worried about the increasing number of cases of Alzheimer’s and Dementia. Some believe that unless a treatment can be found to slow the illness down that it will end up costing billions of dollars in treatment in both private and public healthcare worldwide.Your email address will not be published.

276	Utah People's PostThe Latest News from the Beehive StateMarch 10, 2014 Posted by Contributor The researchers have invented a new blood test for tracing Alzheimer’s disease risk with more than 90 percent accuracy.According to the researchers, this blood test can predict if a healthy person will develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within three years. Moreover, the test has the ability to identify 10 lipids, or fats, in the blood that predict Alzheimer’s disease onset.Study’s corresponding author Howard J Federoff, said “Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder.”Howard J Federoff is professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center.The researchers carried study on 525 healthy participants who were 70 years and above. There blood samples were taken at the time of enrolment and at various points in the study.Over the course of the five-year study, 74 participants were found either suffering from mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or a memory loss condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Out of these 74 participants, 46 were diagnosed upon enrolment and 28 developed aMCI or mild AD during the study (the latter group called converters).When the study was in third year, the researchers selected 53 participants who developed aMCI/AD (including 18 converters) and 53 cognitively normal matched controls for the lipid biomarker discovery phase of the study.A panel of 10 lipids was discovered, which appears to reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or AD. The panel was validated using the remaining 21 aMCI/AD participants (including 10 converters), and 20 controls.Blinded data were analyzed to determine if the subjects could be characterized into the correct diagnostic categories based solely on the 10 lipids identified by researchers.Researchers say, the lipid panel was able to determine with 90 percent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future.The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine.Filed Under: Health Tagged With: Alzheimer’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease test, blood test, blood test for Alzheimer’s diseaseJanuary 25, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 23, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 22, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 21, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 20, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 19, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 18, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 17, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 16, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 15, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 14, 2018 By Amelia Donovan Copyright © 2018 utahpeoplespost.comAbout · Privacy Policy · Terms of Use · Site Map · Contact	Health

280	"Researchers say they have developed a blood test that can predict with 90% accuracy whether someone will develop Alzheimer’s disease three years before the first signs of cognitive decline.The test examined decreasing levels of  fats in the bloodstream, known as lipids, which may be associated with the breakdown of certain brain cells, according to research conducted at Georgetown University and published in “Nature Medicine”.In a study involving 525 healthy adults aged 70 and older, the 74 who lapsed into dementia had low levels of 10 particular lipids compared with others in the study. The study took place over five years, with neurologists testing subjects’ cognitive and memory skills and taking samples of their blood once a year.Doctors typically examine brain scans and spinal-cord fluid to help diagnose the disease. A blood-based test could help families of those afflicted plan future care, though the test is not ready for general use.“The results, while intriguing, are preliminary,” Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer’s Association, told HealthDay news. “They require replication and validation by other scientists in larger and more diverse populations to give them credibility, before further development for clinical use is warranted.”More than 35 million people have Alzheimer’s disease worldwide. The World Health Organization predicts this number will double every 20 years to 115.4 million people by 2050.Follow Michelle on Twitter: @m_cofMore must-reads from MarketWatchMcDonald’s may soon be more like ChipotleBiotech ETFs and indexes pull back sharplyMonopoly Carl Icahn style: Where Apple is Boardwalk and no one goes to jail Health Exchange guides investors to the crucial market intelligence they need to keep up with the health care industry, which makes up one-sixth of the U.S. economy.

According to the research team, the study could be ready for use in clinical studies in as little as two years.Howard J. Federoff, MD, PhD, professor of neurology and author of the study said: ""Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder.""Professor Federoff says that many studies have been performed to try and halt or reverse the effects of Alzheimer's disease, but none have had any success. He says that one of the reasons why this may have happened is that drugs were evaluated too late in the disease process.The five-year study involved 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older who gave blood samples at the start of the study, and at various intervals throughout. During the research, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) or a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), where memory is affected. ""We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals."" added Professor Federoff.Do you like or dislike what you have read?

284	"Georgetown researchers say they've developed a blood test for Alzheimer's that can spot whether a healthy person will develop cognitive declines indicative of the degenerative brain disease within 3 years.The test identified 10 lipids -- or fats -- in the blood that were ""biomarkers"" that might predict disease onset and was 90 percent accurate, researchers reported March 9 in Nature Medicine.If it is validated further, the test could provide an easier and faster way to diagnose the increasingly common brain disease. Currently, Alzheimer's is diagnosed through a complete medical assessment with cognitive tests, neurological exams (like a PET scan) and blood tests to rule out other conditions that cause dementia -- often after people have already developed memory loss and other symptoms.  
                                            A new blood test could allow researchers to predict with some degree of accuracy whether a healthy person could develop Alzheimer's. Dr. Jon LaPo...
                                    ""Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,"" study co-author Dr. Howard J. Federoff, a professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center in the District of Columbia, said in a statement.Alzheimer's is a devastating disease that affects about 4.7 million Americans, rates that are expected to triple to nearly 14 million by 2050. Worldwide, disease rates are expected to double every 20 years until reaching 115.4 million by 2050, according to the World Health OrganizationCurrent Alzheimer's drugs have failed to slow disease progression and are a ""better than nothing"" option to treat some symptoms temporarily. But according to the Georgetown scientists who developed the test, that may be due to the fact they are tested too late in the disease process.""It's like giving somebody Lipitor after they've had their fifth heart attack and are in heart failure. It's too little too late,"" said CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. ""And the thinking is if we give it way earlier in the preventive stage, it will be more effective.""Researchers tested 525 healthy adults aged 70 and older by giving them blood tests at various points during the five-year study. By study's end, 74 people met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer's or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a condition in which cognitive changes -- in this case memory loss -- are serious enough to be noticed by others, buy not to the point where they interfere with daily functioning. Of the 74 patients, 46 were diagnosed at the beginning of the study, and 28 developed the cognitive declines during the study.In year three of the study, the researchers compared 53 people who developed cognitive declines to 53 cognitively-normal people and discovered the differences in lipids.They honed in on 10 lipids, which appeared to be caused by the breakdown of membranes in brain cells. The researchers verified these findings in the other 21 people who had cognitive declines.

Study identifies potential blood test for cognitive decline.Georgetown University Medical CenterA simple blood test has the potential to predict whether a healthy person will develop symptoms of dementia within two or three years. If larger studies uphold the results, the test could fill a major gap in strategies to combat brain degeneration, which is thought to show symptoms only at a stage when it too late to treat effectively.The test was identified in a preliminary study involving 525 people aged over 70. The work identified a set of ten lipid metabolites in blood plasma that distinguished with 90% accuracy between people who would remain cognitively healthy from those who would go on to show signs of cognitive impairment.“These findings are potentially very exciting,” says Simon Lovestone, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, and a coordinator of a major European public-private partnership seeking biomarkers for Alzheimer's. But he points out that only 28 participants developed symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease during the latest work. “So the findings need to be confirmed in independent and larger studies.”There is not yet a good treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which affects 35 million people worldwide. Several promising therapies have been tested in clinical trials over the last few years, but all have failed. However, those trials involved people who had already developed symptoms. Many neuroscientists fear that any benefits of a treatment would be missed in such a study, because it could be impossible to halt the disease once it has manifested. “We desperately need biomarkers which would allow patients to be identified — and recruited into trials — before their symptoms begin,” says Lovestone.The latest study, which is published today in Nature Medicine1, was led by neurologist Howard Federoff of Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington DC. He and his colleagues tested the participants' cognitive and memory skills, and took blood samples from them, around once a year for five years. They used mass spectrometry to analyse the blood plasma of 53 participants with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease, including 18 who developed symptoms during the study, and 53 who remained cognitively healthy. They found ten phospholipids that were present at consistently lower levels in the blood of most people who had, or went on to develop, cognitive impairment. The team validated the results in a set of 41 further participants.“We don’t really know the source of the ten molecules, though we know they are generally present in cell membranes,” says Federoff. But he proposes that concentrations of the phospholipids might somehow reflect the breakdown of neural-cell membranes.Federoff emphasizes that his results will have to be validated in independent labs, and in much larger studies: “We also have to look at different age groups and a more diverse racial mix, and we need longer study periods.”Monique Breteler, head of epidemiology at the German Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn, says that a test based on Federoff’s biomarker set would be advantageously simple. “If you are to screen the population for those destined to get Alzheimer’s, and who may therefore benefit from any treatment that is developed,” she says, “then you need to use material you can access easily, like blood.”Some groups are looking for molecules present in spinal fluid or biomarkers based on brain imaging — procedures that are not practical for large-scale use, she adds.Other research has found differences in patterns of other molecules in the blood of people with Alzheimer’s and healthy controls. But such case–control studies fail to take into account normal variation between individuals, says Breteler. “In general it is better to do a prospective study, like this one, so you can follow how measurements in each individual change as their life progresses.”Mapstone, M. et al.

      “Blood test that can predict Alzheimer's,” was the headline used by BBC News, the Daily Mail and The Guardian today. Similar coverage was seen across many of the front pages of other newspapers. These headlines reflected new research showing how a simple blood test may be able to detect early signs of cognitive decline and mild Alzheimer’s disease.US researchers discovered a panel of 10 biomarkers that, with 90% accuracy, could distinguish people who would progress to have either mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease within two to three years, from those who wouldn’t. While promising, the results were only based on a small group of adults over 70 years old who were studied over five years. Of those who developed mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease, only 28 people had the test. Consequently, it is not clear if the test has any predictive power in the wider population, is applicable to younger adults, or can predict the disease more than two to three years in advance.The Daily Mail outlined how, while the research was a breakthrough, experts had warned it would bring “ethical concerns”. This is an important point, because there is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, so some people may prefer not to know they might get it. The current unrefined test means at least one in 10 would be wrongly told they will go on to develop the condition, given the severity of the disease, this may cause significant needless worry.The study was carried out by researchers from a range of US Universities and Medical institutions and was funded by the US National Institutes of Health. The study was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal, Nature Medicine.The media reporting was generally balanced, with many highlighting the clear ethical question of whether there is any benefit in telling people they are likely to develop a serious condition that currently has no cure. Most media sources correctly acknowledged the need for more research to confirm the usefulness of the test, and that a useable test may be many years away.However, while this research is exciting, it is still in an early stage and so front page coverage in four national newspapers is perhaps a little over-the-top.This was a cohort study looking to see if a blood test could detect Alzheimer’s disease before symptoms developed.Alzheimer’s disease causes a progressive dementia. It affects more than 35 million individuals worldwide and is expected to affect 115 million by 2050. There are currently no cures for the disease and no treatments to improve symptoms to any significant degree. This is because, at the moment, it is only possible to diagnose Alzheimer’s when symptoms such as memory loss show up. Unfortunately, this is usually long after the brain has deteriorated at a cellular level, meaning the disease is well underway by the time it is diagnosed. Current tests for detecting early disease involve invasive medical treatments, which are also time consuming and often expensive. Discovering new tests and treatments targeting early stages of Alzheimer’s, before any outwardly obvious symptoms occur (known as pre-clinical disease), is a hot topic for research. Theoretically, detecting the disease early on will enable more options to be used to stop or slow down the progress of the disease.The researchers recruited a group of people aged 70 or over and analysed their blood and recorded their cognitive abilities over the next five years for signs of decline. The researchers’ examined participants’ blood samples to see if anything in the blood could be used to predict who among the cognitively normal group would develop mental impairment problems and who would not. The researchers enrolled 525 people over the five years and subjected them to a number of questionnaires to assess their mental health, including memory, verbal reasoning, attention, functional capacities. Based on this they were divided into two groups:The control group was selected to match the memory-impaired group on the basis of age, sex and education.The analysis investigated how people’s mental health scores changed after each year during a five year follow up period. Specifically, they wanted to know how many healthy controls went on to develop aMCI or mild Alzheimer’s disease. The main analysis looked for differences in the blood samples of people who went on to develop aMCI or AD and those that did not.The researchers analysed 126 blood samples, including from 18 people who had developed aMCI or mild Alzheimer’s disease during the study period. The blood tests pointed towards a way of distinguishing between those that would develop cognitive impairment and those that would not.After further investigation, the researchers found a set of 10 lipids (fats) in the blood could predict the conversion of people with normal cognitive abilities to either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within a two to three year timeframe with more than 90% accuracy. Once they had the panel of 10 fats that predicted disease development, they tested it on a further group of 41 participants to validate their results. This included 10 people who developed aMCI or mild Alzheimer’s disease during the study period. Similar results were found, confirming the initial findings.The sensitivity and specificity of the test in the validation experiments was 90%.Based on the biochemical tests, the researchers believed the panel of 10 blood fats detected may reflect a worsening of cell membrane integrity contributing to the disease. They concluded the panel of 10 lipids could act as a test that may provide an indication of early deterioration of brain function in the pre-clinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease (when the person does not yet have symptoms). The researchers said they had found and validated a way of assessing blood samples that distinguish cognitively normal participants who will progress to have either aMCI or AD within two to three years from those who won’t. They said that their defined panel of markers featured biochemicals that have essential structural and functional roles in the integrity and functionality of cell membranes.This small cohort study has presented a collection of 10 biomarkers that predicted with 90% accuracy 28 cognitively normal participants who progressed to have either aMCI or mild Alzheimer’s disease within two to three years compared to those who did not. This represents a proof-of-concept that an easily administered blood test may provide a way of detecting Alzheimer’s disease at a pre-clinical stage. The main limitation to bear in mind when interpreting this study is the relatively older group (over 70) and short predictive range investigated. This means the test was only able to detect who would develop cognitive decline in the next two to three years. For that reason, the study does not provide any information on whether the test can predict the disease any earlier, for example by testing the blood of people in their 50s. This will inevitably be the subject of further study.The Daily Mail outlines how “experts called the breakthrough a real step forward, but warn it will bring with it ethical concerns”. This is an important point to consider because there is currently no cure for Alzheimer’s disease. As The Independent put it, “Would anyone welcome being told that they are going to develop – and very likely die from – an incurable disorder that will eventually rob them of their memories, emotions and personality over a period of many years?”The reaction to the news will certainly be different for different individuals, but could be emotionally and psychologically damaging for some.Along a similar line, the current test was 90% accurate. This means at least one in 10 will be wrongly told they will go on to develop the condition, causing needless worry. The researchers cannily point out that the test “requires external validation using similar rigorous clinical classification before further development for clinical use. Such additional validation should be considered in a more diverse demographic group than our initial cohort”. Ultimately, this research provides proof-of-concept that a blood test may predict early stage Alzheimer’s disease, but it’s too early to say whether this test in particular is definitely effective, or could soon be used in mainstream clinical practice. Time, and more research, will tell.

Changes in the blood may signify Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stages, researchers found.A new study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, identified 10 molecules in blood could be used to predict with at least 90pc accuracy whether people will go on to develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.It is the first research which has been able to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between people with Alzheimer's disease before the symptoms occur and people who will not go on to develop the condition.The finding has potential for developing treatment strategies for Alzheimer's at an earlier stage – when therapy would be more effective at slowing or preventing onset of symptoms, the authors said.CONDITIONSResearchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre in the US examined 525 healthy participants aged 70 and over and monitored them for five years.During the research 28 participants went on to develop the conditions and 46 were diagnosed at the start of the study.Midway through the research, the authors analysed 53 patients who already had one of the conditions and 53 ""cognitively normal"" people.The scientists discovered 10 molecules which appeared to ""reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease"".The scientists then tested other participants' blood to see whether these biomarkers could predict whether or not they would go on to develop the conditions.By measuring the presence of 10 compounds the researchers could predict with 90pc accuracy people that would go on to suffer from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD).""The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90pc accuracy these two distinct groups – cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,"" said one of the study's authors, Professor Howard Federoff.HNEWS@HERALD.IE

291	"""The ability to identify individuals who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s before the clinical manifestation of cognitive impairment has long been a Holy Grail of the neuromedicine community,"" says Mark Mapstone. ""Biomarkers that can allow us to intervene early in the course of the disease could be a game-changer."" (Credit: Phillip Jeffrey/Flickr)You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license.Researchers have developed a blood test that predicts with more than 90 percent accuracy who is at risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease.The findings could lead to a new generation of treatments to head off the disease before neurological damage becomes irreversible.The biomarker—which consists of 10 specific lipids found in blood plasma—can also predict who will go on to develop a precursor condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).[related]The cost of the simple blood test required to detect these lipids is a fraction of other techniques and, unlike alternatives, it identifies risk early in the disease process before cognitive symptoms appears.“The ability to identify individuals who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s before the clinical manifestation of cognitive impairment has long been a Holy Grail of the neuromedicine community,” says lead author Mark Mapstone, a neuropsychologist with the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry.“Current efforts to develop a treatment for this disease are coming up short because they are probably being used too late. Biomarkers that can allow us to intervene early in the course of the disease could be a game-changer.”Alzheimer’s research is at an impasse with many once promising experimental therapies failing in late stage clinical trials. These setbacks have led all but a few major pharmaceutical companies to pull back from their research and development in the disease.The absence of an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s, and the dwindling options in the drug development pipeline, mean that the nation—and the world—are woefully unprepared for the coming Silver Tsunami of aging baby boomers who will develop the disease in the coming years. By 2050, an estimated 14 million Americans will have Alzheimer’s, consuming an estimated $1.2 trillion in health care costs per year.There is an emerging scientific consensus that once the cognitive symptoms of the Alzheimer’s have emerged, it may be too late to slow or reverse the neurological damage caused by the disease.Researchers speculate that if treatments could be initiated early in the disease cycle, they may stand more of a chance of being effective. In fact, many of the same experimental treatments that have failed in recent clinical studies may ultimately prove to be successful if they are given to patients sooner.   The challenge is there currently exists no way to identify which people are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s.There are several screening methods that can detect Alzheimer’s disease. These include spinal taps which measure the presence of the proteins beta amyloid and tau and advanced imaging systems such as MRIs, PET scans, and functional MRIs that spot changes in the brain.But these techniques have significant limitations. First, they have only been shown to be effective in confirming the diagnosing of the diseases after the cognitive symptoms have surfaced. And second, the high cost associated with these technologies is a significant barrier to widespread use in clinical practice.For the new study, published in Nature Medicine, 425 seniors in the Rochester area underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and a blood draw once a year over a five-year period. An additional 100 individuals from Irvine, California were enrolled in the study.Researchers used a technique called mass spectrometry to screen for lipid levels in blood plasma. Lipids are a class of naturally occurring molecules found in the body that play a role in energy storage, signaling, and form the structural components of cell membranes. The scientists identified 10 specific lipids that, if present in lower than normal levels, could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy whether an individual would go on to develop either Alzheimer’s or aMCI.The scientists are not entirely sure why this particular set of lipids is indicative of Alzheimer’s. All ten represent a class of lipids called phospholipids, molecules that are important cellular building blocks.The researchers speculate that the lower lipid levels could be an early indication that the brain cells lost in the disease are beginning to lose their integrity and break down.Once commercialized, a blood test required to detect these lipids would likely cost less than $200—compared to thousands of dollars for a spinal tap or MRI—and could be ordered as a part of a routine exam by an individual’s primary care physician.“Having a tool that is able to identify, with a high degree of accuracy and at a low cost, which individuals will convert to Alzheimer’s could transform how we care for this devastating disease,” Mapstone says.Researchers from Georgetown University and the University of California, Irvine, contributed to the study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Aging and the Department of Defense.Source: University of Rochester

292	"(CNN) — In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have developed a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease that predicts with astonishing accuracy whether a healthy person will develop the disease.Though much work still needs to be done, it is hoped the test will someday be available in doctors’ offices, since the only methods for predicting Alzheimer’s right now, such as PET scans and spinal taps, are expensive, impractical, often unreliable and sometimes risky.“This is a potential game-changer,” said Dr. Howard Federoff, senior author of the report and a neurologist at Georgetown University Medical Center. “My level of enthusiasm is very high.”The study was published in Nature Medicine.‘We were surprised’In the beginning, the researchers knew they wanted to find a blood test to detect Alzheimer’s but didn’t know what specifically to look for. Should they examine patients’ DNA? Their RNA? Or should they look for the byproducts of DNA and RNA, such as fats and proteins?They decided to start with fats, since it was the easiest and least expensive. They drew blood from hundreds of healthy people over age 70 living near Rochester, New York, and Irvine, California. Five years later, 28 of the seniors had developed Alzheimer’s disease or the mild cognitive problems that usually precede it.Scouring more than 100 fats, or lipids, for what might set this group apart, they found that these 28 seniors had low levels of 10 particular lipids, compared with healthy seniors.To confirm their findings, the researchers then looked at the blood of 54 other patients who had Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment. This group also had low levels of the lipids.Overall, the blood test predicted who would get Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment with over 90% accuracy.“We were surprised,” said Mark Mapstone, a neuropsychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center and lead author of the study. “But it turns out that it appears we were looking in the right place.”The ‘holy grail’The beauty of this test, Mapstone says, is that it caught Alzheimer’s before the patient even had symptoms, suggesting that the disease process begins long before people’s memories start failing. He says that perhaps the lipid levels started decreasing at the same time as brain cells started dying.He and his team plan to try out this test in people in their 40s and 50s. If that works, he says, that would be the “holy grail,” because then researchers could try experimental drugs and treatments in a group that’s almost sure to get the disease. That would speed research along immensely.Plus, people could get a heads up that they were probably destined to get Alzheimer’s. Although some people might not want to know that they’re destined for a horrible disease, others might be grateful for the warning.Federoff said he would want to know whether he was on his way to getting the disease, even though there’s nothing he could do about it. He might want to take a family trip he’d been thinking about or might want to appoint a successor at work.“I would make sure that things that are important to me get done,” he said.But, Federoff added, others might not want to know they were about to get a devastating disease they were powerless to stop.“I think it’s a very personal decision,” Federoff said. “It would have to be thought through on multiple dimensions. Patients and their families would have to be counseled.”Next stepsOther research teams are looking at other possible tests for Alzheimer’s. The need for a screening test of some kind for Alzheimer’s has never been greater: A report released last week says the disease claims the lives of perhaps a half a million Americans, making it nearly as deadly as heart disease and cancer.If any of these tests work out — and that’s still an if — it would take years to make it to doctors’ offices, since the test would need to be validated by other labs and with larger groups of people. Thee test developed by the Georgetown and Rochester researchers, for example, was used mainly in white people, and it might not work as well with other groups.Heather Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer’s Association, said the study was well done but much work is still needed.“It’s an interesting paper. It’s an intriguing study. But it is very preliminary,” she said.Filed in: News Visit them today!

Scientists have developed a blood test that they say could lead to an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia in elderly people long before the symptoms of the disease begin to manifest themselves. A team led by Dr. Howard Federoff of the Georgetown University School of Medicine has developed a test based on measuring the levels of ten fatty chemicals -- commonly called lipids -- in the blood. As membranes of the brain cells affected by Alzheimer's begin to break down, the levels of the lipids decrease. The Georgetown team analyzed blood samples from 525 volunteers, all of whom were over the age of 70. Halfway through a five-year period, the team compared blood samples from 53 patients who were already affected by either Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with samples from 53 patients who were ""cognitively normal."" They found that analyzing the lipid levels could predict with 90 percent accuracy whether patients went on develop MCI or Alzheimer's within three years. ""We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a pre-clinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals."" Dr. Federoff wrote.Other researchers said that offering such a test would create an ethical dilemma for doctors. ""Having such a test would be an interesting development, but it also throws up ethical considerations,"" Dr. Doug Brown, director of research and development at Great Britain's Alzheimer's Society, told the Independent. ""If this does develop in the future, people must be given a choice about whether they would want to know, and fully understand the implications.""The full study will be published in the April issue of Nature Medicine. Click for more from Georgetown UniversityClick for more from Sky NewsClick for more from The IndependentView AllThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

295	A novel blood-based biomarker test has been shown to predict with over 90% accuracy the likelihood of a healthy individual developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease within three years. The results of the study on the test were published online March 9 in Nature Medicine.Mark Mapstone, PhD, from the University of Rochester School of Medicine, and colleagues from six other institutions enrolled 525 community-dwelling healthy individuals aged ≥70 for the 5-year observational study. Participants were defined into three main groups as amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease (aMCI/AD), phenoconverted (Converter), and Normal Control (NC). During the study, 74 participants met criteria foraMCI/AD, 46 at entry were incidental cases, and 28 at entry were  Converters from nonimpaired memory status.RELATED: Neurologic Disorders Resource CenterResearchers examined 124 plasma samples from the 106 discovery-phase individuals for untargeted metabolomic analysis. The phospholipid biomarker test accurately predicted over 90% of eventual phenoconvert from cognitive intactness to aMCI or AD through the test revealing lower plasma levels of serotonin, phenylalanine, proline, lysine, phosphatidylcholine (PC), taurine, and acylcarnitine (AC). The authors posit that this shows neural cell membranes failing in individuals who will phenoconvert from cognitive intactness to aMCI or AD.There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, although treatments are available. Efforts to develop medications to slow or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease have not been successful, possibly due to the evaluation of the drugs late in the disease process. By identifying the disease prior to onset, interventions could be developed for disease modification.Visit the Nature Medicine website for the abstract and full article. 	Health

298	Mon., March 10, 2014, 6 a.m.Alzheimer’s disease claims nearly 500,000 American lives each year.  And now new research has discovered the “predictors” of Alzheimer’s disease could rest within one’s specific lipids – detected through a blood test.  The test could identify who is most likely (research states 90 percent accuracy) to be diagnosed with the disease.If one is identified, before symptoms appear, as likely to one day have the disease, possible treatment could begin. This news could catapult research –and answers - far beyond what we have previously imagined.The mythical game of “Would you want to know if you were going to get Alzheimer’s?” now requires additional thought when treatment may easily follow. Just as women who have the BRCA gene for breast cancer make proactive choices, potential Alzheimer’s sufferers may be able to use the predictors to make proactive decisions, possibly eliminating the onset of the disease.

300	"As Milestones Are Reached, Best Practices Will Become Less HazyUsing Multi-Omic Technology to Reclassify and Improve Treatment for Autoimmune DiseaseImmunotherapies Can Produce Side Effects That Mimic Autoimmune DiseasesInterview with Nigel Darby, Advisor, GE Healthcare Life Sciences

	If Alzheimer’s disease could be detected in its early stages, before evident memory loss and functional decline, existing treatments could be started sooner, possibly with more effect. And emerging therapies might stand a greater chance of delaying symptoms. They might even cure the disease, which is projected to afflict 115 million people worldwide by 2050.
	To date, tests intended to predict Alzheimer’s onset have been of limited utility. Such tests include imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and brain amyloid imaging, and biomarker techniques, such as cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-beta levels. They have failed to enjoy common clinical use because they are invasive, time-consuming, or expensive.
	Now, however, a blood test that identifies 10 lipids has been used to predict Alzheimer’s onset. According to a study published March 9 in Nature Medicine, the test “predicted phenoconversion to either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within a 2–3 year timeframe with over 90% accuracy.”
	This study was the work of researchers centered at Georgetown University Medical Center. According to the study, which was entitled “Plasma phospholipids identify antecedent memory impairment in older adults,” the 10-lipid biopanel reflects cell membrane integrity and “may be sensitive to early neurodegeneration of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.” That is, the blood test appears to reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment of Alzheimer’s disease.
	A release issued by Georgetown University indicated that the study included 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older who gave blood samples upon enrolling and at various points in the study. Over the course of the five-year study, the release continued, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory loss is prominent. Of these, 46 were diagnosed upon enrollment and 28 developed aMCI or mild AD during the study (the latter group called converters).
	In the study's third year, the researchers selected 53 participants who developed aMCI/AD (including 18 converters) and 53 cognitively normal matched controls for the lipid biomarker discovery phase of the study. The lipids were not targeted before the start of the study, but rather, were an outcome of the study.
	Subsequently, the researchers validated the biopanel. In addition, they analyzed blinded data to confirm that the biopanel could match subjects with the correct diagnostic categories. Finally, they examined if the presence of the APOE4 gene, a known risk factor for developing AD, would contribute to accurate classification of the groups, but found it was not a significant predictive factor in this study.
	""We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals,"" said Howard J. Federoff, M.D., Ph.D., the study’s corresponding author and professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center. “We're designing a clinical trial where we'll use this panel to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer's to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease.""

302	"A new blood test procedure was developed by researcher that can predict Alzheimer's with a 90 percent accuracy rate. This finding can potentially offer cheaper and faster means of being tested for this cognitive disease.Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Center, led by neurologist Dr. Howard Federoff, have initiated another study that they believe is a potential game-changer. They recruited hundreds of healthy seniors as participants and analyzed the fats on their blood.After the five-year follow-up period, 28 of the participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. They then reviewed the blood of these seniors and identified 10 lipids that were lower than those who did not develop the cognitive disease.""This is a potential game-changer,"" said Dr. Federoff, to CNN. ""My level of enthusiasm is very high.""They then took blood tests from other 54 Alzheimer's patients and compared their lipids to the study participants. Surprisingly, 90 percent of them showed low levels of the 10 lipids.The researchers plan to continue their study and test if the same results will show for those below 50 years old. If successful, other researches can focus more on the development of medicines and treatments for this cognitive disease.Alzheimer's disease has remained as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States affecting more than five million people in the country. The Alzheimer's Association predicted that this will increase to 7.1 million by 2025 and 13.8 million by 2050.To date, there is no certain way yet to predict and treat this cognitive disease despite multiple studies done. In fact, the Obama administration has increased the funding for these studies by $156 million to find an answer by 2025.      If no cure will be developed by 2050, it is forecasted to cost the government about $1.2 trillion.This study was published in the March 9 issue of Nature Medicine."	Health

305	Mind / 10 March 2014, 3:30pm / SAPAParis - Researchers in the United States say they have developed a prototype blood test that can tell with 90-percent accuracy whether  a healthy person will develop Alzheimer's disease within three years.The test looks for 10 signatures of fatty proteins called lipids, according to a study published  in the journal Nature Medicine.It could help families of people developing the cognitive disorder make early decisions on how best to care for them and may also aid the search for treatment, the authors said.Several years of clinical trials are likely to be needed to assess the prototype technique, the first blood “biomarker” to predict the tragic degenerative disease.Alzheimer's, caused by toxic proteins that destroy brain cells, is a currently incurable and fatal degenerative disease.Around 35 million people have the disease, a tally that is expected to reach 115 million people by 2050, according to the World Health Organisation.“Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at  risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients,  their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,” said Howard Federoff, a professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington.It could also help efforts to treat the disease, he said in a press release.Attempts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's have failed possibly because they are tested when the disease has progressed too far, Federoff said.These treatments may have a better chance of braking or reversing the disease if they are trialled at a much earlier stage,  he said.The researchers started by taking blood samples from 525 healthy  volunteers aged 70 and older.Three years later, they looked at a group of 53 volunteers who had developed symptoms of early Alzheimer's or a memory-affecting condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).The blood samples from this group were compared against the samples from 53 otherwise healthy volunteers to see what the difference was.From this, the scientists spotted the 10 telltale lipid proteins, which appear to be metabolised residues of brain cell membranes. - Sapa-AFP'We are coming 4 you this Friday, bloody die white puppet'Israel: no country for black peopleVIDEO: Analysts applaud Gordhan 'the interrogator'Excitement grows over R100m Lotto prizeMugabe supercars in Botswana prang: policeSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.

306	"Alzheimer’s disease is often under-reported as a cause of death and may contribute to nearly as many deaths as heart disease or cancer, according to a new study published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.“Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are under-reported on death certificates and medical records,” said study author Bryan D. James, Ph.D, of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “Death certificates often list the immediate cause of death, such as pneumonia, rather than listing dementia as an underlying cause.”James noted that trying to identify a single cause of death does not always capture the reality of death for most elderly people, and that multiple health issues are often at work.“The estimates generated by our analysis suggest that deaths from Alzheimer’s disease far exceed the numbers reported by the CDC and those listed on death certificates,” said James.Alzheimer’s currently comes in sixth on the list of leading causes of death in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — heart disease and cancer top the list.For the study, researchers enrolled 2,566 participants ages 65 and older (average age was 78) to receive yearly testing for dementia. After an average of eight years, 1,090 participants died. A total of 559 participants without dementia at the start of the study developed Alzheimer’s disease — the average time from diagnosis to death was about four years. Through autopsy, Alzheimer’s disease was confirmed for about nine out of 10 of those who were clinically diagnosed.The death rate was over four times greater after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in participants ages 75 to 84 and nearly three times higher in those age 85 and older. More than one-third of all deaths in those age groups were attributable to Alzheimer’s disease.James said “this translates into approximately 503,400 deaths from Alzheimer’s in the U.S. in people over the age of 75 in 2010.  This is five to six times higher than the 83,494 number reported by the CDC based on death certificates.”“Determining the true effects of dementia in this country is important for raising public awareness and identifying research priorities regarding this epidemic,” said James.Source:  American Academy of Neurology    Psych Central does not provide medical, mental illness, or psychological

				The team making the breakthrough called it a ""highly sensitive and specific test.""Their work is based on checking the levels of ten different fats in the blood, and they claim it’s 90% effective in predicting Alzheimer's several years before any symptoms show up.An MRI or spinal tap will find the same thing but scientists believe the faster, cheaper, and easier test can be a ""game changer,"" in helping slow down the terrible disease.
The BBC reports the study by scientists at Georgetown University looked at blood from over 500 people over the age of 70 for a five-year period.The tests will now move to involve bigger groups, but if they continue to be effective, researchers believe a question will arise.Will patients be ready to find out what would be ""life-altering,"" news?While knowing Alzheimer's was on the way could help people make plans to reduce the stress on family members, it could also change the way others see those with the diagnosis.

312	"Researchers at Georgetown University have published a study in Nature Medicine claiming they have found a way to successfully predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease with 90 percent accuracy, thanks to a test that relies on examining fat levels in the blood. The researchers compared the blood samples of 53 people with Alzheimer's with 53 people who remained mentally agile over five years to conclude there were significant differences in levels of 10 lipids or fats in the blood. Studying these lipid levels was the key to predicting the disorder, though it needs to be tested on a larger sample size to be confirmed. With the ability to predict the degenerative brain disorder comes the ethical challenge of whether people would want to know they will suffer from it. Said the Alzheimer's Society's Dr. Doug Brown, “If this does develop in the future, people must be given a choice about whether they would want to know, and fully understand the implications."""	Health
313	" (CNN) - In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have developed a blood test for Alzheimer's disease that predicts with astonishing accuracy whether a healthy person will develop the disease. 			Though much work still needs to be done, it is hoped the test will someday be available in doctors' offices, since the only methods for predicting Alzheimer's right now, such as PET scans and spinal taps, are expensive, impractical, often unreliable and sometimes risky. ""This is a potential game-changer,"" said Dr. Howard Federoff, senior author of the report and a neurologist at Georgetown University Medical Center. ""My level of enthusiasm is very high."" The study was published in Nature Medicine. In the beginning, the researchers knew they wanted to find a blood test to detect Alzheimer's but didn't know what specifically to look for. Should they examine patients' DNA? Their RNA? Or should they look for the byproducts of DNA and RNA, such as fats and proteins? They decided to start with fats, since it was the easiest and least expensive. They drew blood from hundreds of healthy people over age 70 living near Rochester, New York, and Irvine, California. Five years later, 28 of the seniors had developed Alzheimer's disease or the mild cognitive problems that usually precede it. Scouring more than 100 fats, or lipids, for what might set this group apart, they found that these 28 seniors had low levels of 10 particular lipids, compared with healthy seniors. To confirm their findings, the researchers then looked at the blood of 54 other patients who had Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment. This group also had low levels of the lipids. Overall, the blood test predicted who would get Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment with over 90% accuracy. ""We were surprised,"" said Mark Mapstone, a neuropsychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center and lead author of the study. ""But it turns out that it appears we were looking in the right place."" The beauty of this test, Mapstone says, is that it caught Alzheimer's before the patient even had symptoms, suggesting that the disease process begins long before people's memories start failing. He says that perhaps the lipid levels started decreasing at the same time as brain cells started dying. He and his team plan to try out this test in people in their 40s and 50s. If that works, he says, that would be the ""holy grail,"" because then researchers could try experimental drugs and treatments in a group that's almost sure to get the disease. That would speed research along immensely.Plus, people could get a heads up that they were probably destined to get Alzheimer's. Although some people might not want to know that they're destined for a horrible disease, others might be grateful for the warning.Federoff said he would want to know whether he was on his way to getting the disease, even though there's nothing he could do about it. He might want to take a family trip he'd been thinking about or might want to appoint a successor at work. ""I would make sure that things that are important to me get done,"" he said. But, Federoff added, others might not want to know they were about to get a devastating disease they were powerless to stop. ""I think it's a very personal decision,"" Federoff said. ""It would have to be thought through on multiple dimensions. Patients and their families would have to be counseled."" Other research teams are looking at other possible tests for Alzheimer's. The need for a screening test of some kind for Alzheimer's has never been greater: A report released last week says the disease claims the lives of perhaps a half a million Americans, making it nearly as deadly as heart disease and cancer.If any of these tests work out -- and that's still an if -- it would take years to make it to doctors' offices, since the test would need to be validated by other labs and with larger groups of people. Thee test developed by the Georgetown and Rochester researchers, for example, was used mainly in white people, and it might not work as well with other groups. Heather Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer's Association, said the study was well done but much work is still needed. ""It's an interesting paper. It's an intriguing study. But it is very preliminary,"" she said. Article on CNN.com"	Health

SCIENTISTS have developed a blood test that could detect whether or not a person will develop dementia within three years.
Blood changes may signify Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stages, researchers found.A study in the journal Nature Medicine, identified 10 molecules in blood could be used to predict with at least 90% accuracy if people will develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.It is the first research which has been able to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between people with Alzheimer's disease before the symptoms occur and people who will not go on to develop the condition.The finding has potential for developing treatment strategies for Alzheimer's earlier.Georgetown University Medical Centre researchers found 10 molecules which appeared to ""reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease"".

319	"WASHINGTON (CBSDC) — Researchers from Georgetown University say they have developed a blood test that can predict if a healthy person will develop Alzheimer’s disease or mild dementia.The study claims that the blood test “can predict with 90 percent accuracy” if a person will develop these debilitating diseases.“Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,” Dr. Howard Federoff, the study’s author and executive vice president of health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center, said in a statement.RELATED: Study: Uninsured Patients Get Better Care Than Insured

The test reveals “changes in the breakdown of neural cell membranes resulting in 10 identifiable lipids.”. The study shows that two of the 10 identifiable lipids “have strong links to the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s.”“We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals,” Federoff said. “We’re intending to design a clinical trial where we’ll use this panel to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer’s to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease.”Federoff added: “The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 percent accuracy these two distinct groups – cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future.”RELATED: Study: 45 Percent Of Americans Live With Chronic Medical Condition

Researchers hope this test will help develop earlier treatment options for people that will end up suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia.“The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention, and biomarkers defining this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics,” Federoff stated.The World Health Organization predicts the incurable Alzheimer’s disease will double every 20 years globally, going from 35.6 million individuals suffering from the disease in 2010 to 115.4 million by 2050.The study will be published in the April issue of Nature Medicine.Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment: You are commenting using your Twitter account.

One reason might be that there is no reliable way to detect the disease before its devastating symptoms, including memory loss and functional decline, become apparent. A new study, however, might have discovered such a detection system: a blood test that researchers say can predict, with greater than 90 percent accuracy, whether a healthy person will develop Alzheimer's within three years.There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, and no effective treatment.

The study, conducted at several university hospitals, was published online yesterday in the April issue of the journal Nature Medicine. Over the course of five years, 76 of the 525 test subjects were diagnosed with either Alzheimer’s or a condition called amnestic mild cognitive impairment, which is associated with memory loss. Patients who had a set of 10 lipids, or fats, were more likely to develop one of the diseases. Other tests that look for certain “biomarkers” associated with Alzheimer’s, such as magnetic resonance imaging, are limited because they are invasive or prohibitively expensive. Trials that examine the role of amyloids, proteins that build up in the brain, have been inconclusive. Developing a blood test that could give people warning would be huge, Kawas said. “The thing that distinguishes this paper is, we appear possibly to be identifying a marker that’s apparent before the person has the disease,” she said. But the blood test won’t be ready for further clinical trials for two more years. The test must be replicated to make sure it works, Kawas said. Even if it’s confirmed to be effective, getting a heads-up won’t be enough for patients: They’ll want a drug that will prevent or delay the disease. “We’re not there yet,” Kawas said.There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, and no effective treatment.One reason might be that there is no reliable way to detect the disease before its devastating symptoms, including memory loss and functional decline, become apparent.A new study, however, might have discovered such a detection system: a blood test that researchers say can predict, with greater than 90 percent accuracy, whether a healthy person will develop Alzheimer’s within three years.“This has sort of been the holy grail for a lot of years: even finding a blood test to tell the difference between a person who has Alzheimer’s disease and someone who’s normal,” said Dr. Claudia Kawas, a professor of neurology at UC-Irvine Medical School and one of 17 co-authors of a new study on the blood test.The study, conducted at several university hospitals, was published online yesterday in the April issue of the journal Nature Medicine.Over the course of five years, 76 of the 525 test subjects were diagnosed with either Alzheimer’s or a condition called amnestic mild cognitive impairment, which is associated with memory loss. Patients who had a set of 10 lipids, or fats, were more likely to develop one of the diseases.Other tests that look for certain “biomarkers” associated with Alzheimer’s, such as magnetic resonance imaging, are limited because they are invasive or prohibitively expensive. Trials that examine the role of amyloids, proteins that build up in the brain, have been inconclusive.Developing a blood test that could give people warning would be huge, Kawas said.“The thing that distinguishes this paper is, we appear possibly to be identifying a marker that’s apparent before the person has the disease,” she said.But the blood test won’t be ready for further clinical trials for two more years. The test must be replicated to make sure it works, Kawas said.Even if it’s confirmed to be effective, getting a heads-up won’t be enough for patients: They’ll want a drug that will prevent or delay the disease.“We’re not there yet,” Kawas said.

         111View  commentsA simple blood test has been developed that gives healthy elderly people precious early warning they may get Alzheimer’s within the next three years. It is hoped the test, the first to predict accurately who will become ill, could speed the search for new drugs that can delay or even prevent the devastating brain disease.It could eventually lead to widespread screening in middle-age to identify those most at risk and give them greater warning.Incurable: Alzheimer's disease causes brain atrophy (decrease in size), shown here by the enlarged ventricle cavities (white, at centre of brain) and the widened pale blue regions. Experts called the breakthrough a real
 step forward, but warn it will bring with it ethical concerns, 
particularly if there is still no cure.Alzheimer’s
 and other forms of dementia affect some 800,000 Britons and the number 
is predicted to double in a generation as the population ages. David 
Cameron has described dementia as ‘the key health challenge of this 
generation’.Existing 
medicines are of limited use and several promising pills and potions 
have failed to live up to hopes. However, many believe this is because 
they are being tested too late in the disease – and may work if given in
 the very early stages.The 
latest research, from Georgetown University in Washington DC, opens up 
the possibility of identifying those who will benefit from them the 
most. Even delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s would have a massive impact
 on the lives of sufferers and their loved ones.Devastating: Alzheimer's robs people of their cognitive function and then their life Researcher
 Howard Federoff took blood samples from hundreds of healthy men and 
women aged 70-plus. During the next five years, some developed 
Alzheimer’s. Their blood samples were then compared with the samples 
taken from the people who remained free of the disease.This
 flagged up a battery of ten fats that were present in lower amounts in 
the blood of those who went on to develop memory problems – despite them
 appearing healthy at the time they gave blood. Dr Federoff then 
confirmed the finding on a second group.Writing
 in the journal Nature Medicine, he said the test can give two to three 
years’ warning of Alzheimer’s with 90 per cent accuracy. He said it is 
the first blood test to accurately forecast if an apparently healthy 
person will succumb to Alzheimer’s. It is also quicker, cheaper and less
 invasive than other methods such as expensive scans and painful lumbar 
punctures.It isn’t entirely
 clear how the test works but changes in the blood may be a sign of 
brain cells deteriorating even when people appear healthy.Dr
 Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘More work is needed to
 confirm these findings, but a blood test to identify people at risk of 
Alzheimer’s would be a real step forward for research.’Dr
 Doug Brown, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Having such a test would
 be an interesting development, but it also throws up ethical 
considerations. If this does develop in the future people must be given a
 choice about whether they would want to know, and fully understand the 
implications.’Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"	Health

Scientists have discovered a blood test that can predict with greater than 90% accuracy if a healthy person will develop Alzheimer’s within three years.Described in Nature Medicine published online, the study* heralds the potential for developing treatment strategies for Alzheimer's at an earlier stage, when therapy would be more effective.It is the first known published report of blood-based biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer's.The test identifies 10 lipids in the blood that predict disease onset. It could be ready for use in clinical studies in as few as two years and, researchers say, other diagnostic uses are possible.""Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,"" says study author Howard Federoff, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center, in the USA. Federoff explains there have been many efforts to develop drugs to slow or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease, but all of them have failed. He says one reason may be the drugs were evaluated too late in the disease process.""The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,"" Federoff says. ""Biomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics.""The study included 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older who gave blood samples upon enrolling and at various points in the study. Over the course of the five-year study, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Of these, 46 were diagnosed upon enrolment and 28 developed aMCI or mild AD during the study (the latter group called converters).In the study's third year, the researchers selected 53 participants who developed aMCI/AD (including 18 converters) and 53 cognitively normal matched controls for the lipid biomarker discovery phase of the study. The lipids were not targeted before the start of the study, but rather, were an outcome of the study.A panel of 10 lipids was discovered, which researchers say appears to reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or AD. The panel was subsequently validated using the remaining 21 aMCI/AD participants (including 10 converters), and 20 controls. Blinded data were analysed to determine if the subjects could be characterised into the correct diagnostic categories based solely on the 10 lipids identified in the discovery phase.""The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90% accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,"" Federoff says.The researchers examined if the presence of the APOE4 gene, a known risk factor for developing AD, would contribute to accurate classification of the groups, but found it was not a significant predictive factor in this study.""We consider our results a major step toward the commercialisation of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals,"" Federoff says.

328	 WASHINGTON — Dr. Howard Federoff of the Georgetown Medical School calls this “a very exciting time.” That’s because his research team has come up with a blood test that identifies those at risk of getting Alzheimer’s disease within three years.  Today, cognitive impairment, or Alzeheimer’s, is basically treated after symptoms occur, and Dr. Federoff says that’s too late.  “There have been many efforts to develop drugs that were thought to modify the history of Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr. Federoff says, “and sadly, all of them have failed.”  Federoff says it’s possible those drugs didn’t work because they were administered too late. And this new test could allow treatment to begin much sooner.  Follow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.Need a break? Play a quick game of solitaire or Sudoku. Or take one of our fun quizzes!

329	In a first-of-its-kind study, a blood test has been proven effective in predicting the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) coming on in the next three years.The groundbreaking blood test developed by expert teams at Georgetown University and the University of Rochester can predict with 90% accuracy whether a healthy person will develop Alzheimer’s or early memory loss related to the disease.Though larger clinical trials are needed to be carried on to confirm the findings, its developers hoped the test will someday be available as a part of a routine check-up in doctors’ offices to detect the AD as early as possible.Currently PET scans and spinal taps (a lumbar puncture) are the only methods for predicting Alzheimer’s, and these procedures are both expensive and risky, and sometimes are also impractical and unreliable.“This is the first time a highly sensitive and specific test has been able to predict who will become demented,” says Dr. Howard Federoff, senior author of the research and a neurologist at Georgetown University Medical Center of Georgetown. “This is a potential game-changer. My level of enthusiasm is very high.”For the purpose of the study, the research team collected samples from 525 people over the age of 70 living near Rochester, New York, and Irvine, California.Five years later, 53 of the seniors had developed Alzheimer’s disease or the mild cognitive impairment. The researchers then analyzed their blood samples and compared them with 53 people who stayed mentally agile.They found changes in a particular pattern of 10 lipids or fat-like compounds in the study subjects who later developed Alzheimer’s. The researchers also noted that seniors with low levels of the lipids were more likely to develop the memory loss.“We were surprised,” said Mark Mapstone, a neuropsychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center who helped lead the study. “But it turns out that it appears we were looking in the right place.”Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia that robs a person, usually in older age, of memories and brain functions such as thinking and reasoning. The AD affects more than 5 million Americans and this number is projected to soar to 13 million over the next 35 years. Likewise, the number of dementia-hit people around the globe stands at 44 million and is expected to treble by 2050.The latest findings are reported in the Nature Medicine.	Health

332	A team of scientists has developed a new blood test that could help physicians make a highly accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia in a healthy but older person.According to the researchers, the test is based on identifying 10 fatty chemicals called lipids in the blood, which can predict if a patient will suffer from the disease, and help develop treatment strategies for various forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's, at an earlier stage when therapy would be more effective at slowing or preventing the onset of symptoms.“Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,” Howard J. Federoff of the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington said in a statement.As part of the study, which is due to be published in the April issue of Nature Medicine, the researchers analyzed blood samples from 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older. In the third year of the five-year-long study, the researchers compared blood samples from 53 patients who were already affected by either Alzheimer's disease, or a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment, or aMCI, with samples from 53 patients who were “cognitively normal.”The scientists found that analyzing the lipid levels could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy if the patients went on to develop aMCI or Alzheimer's disease within three years. The blood test is expected to be ready for use in clinical studies within two years, the researchers said.There is yet no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer's, which currently afflicts nearly 35.6 million people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, the number of people with Alzheimer's disease will double every 20 years to reach 115.4 million by 2050.“We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals,” Federoff said. “We're designing a clinical trial where we'll use this panel to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer's to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease.”Subscribe	Health
333	The test can detect the disease up to three years before the onset of symptoms, however it is only 90 per cent accurateA blood test that can detect Alzheimer’s disease up to three years before the onset of symptoms has been developed by scientists who believe that it could lead to the early diagnosis of progressive dementia in elderly people.The test raises ethical concerns, however, as it is only 90 per cent accurate in its current form – meaning that up to one in ten people could be wrongly diagnosed with a disease for which there is no effective treatment.Researchers nevertheless believe that a blood test for Alzheimer’s could help in the search for a therapy or cure by identifying those people in the population at highest risk and who could therefore benefit most from experimental treatments.The blood test is based on analysing the fatty chemicals – known as lipids – circulating in the bloodstream, which begin to change as a result of a breakdown in the membranes of the brain cells associated with Alzheimer’s.Scientists have known that Alzheimer’s disease begins long before the onset of the diagnostic symptoms, such as memory loss or confusion, and have tried for many years to find ways of detecting these changes with simple tests that could be used in the clinic.A team of researchers led by Howard Federoff of Georgetown University Medical Centre in Washington identified 10 lipids in the blood that can be used to detect the early signs of Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia, which affects one in three people over the age of 65.“Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,” Dr Federoff said.“If there were to be a test that could be ordered by a clinician to determine Alzheimer’s risk, the patient, along with their family and clinician, would have to determine what’s right for them: test or not test. If so, the testing process would need to be managed and could involve counselling akin to [gene tests] for cancer risk,” he told The Independent.Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer’s Society, said it is the first time that a blood test has been developed for the disorder, but there are problems in working out how it can be used in practice.“Having such a test would be an interesting development, but it also throws up ethical considerations. If this does develop in the future, people must be given a choice about whether they would want to know, and fully understand the implications,” Dr Brown said.The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, involved taking blood samples from 525 healthy volunteers over the age of 70 who were monitored over five years to see whether they went on to develop mild dementia or Alzheimer’s.The researchers identified the 10 lipids after some of the volunteers were showing the first signs of dementia, and then used the same panel of “biomarkers” to predict whether the other volunteers will go on to develop the disorder.“The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 per cent accuracy these two distinct groups – cognitively normal participants who would progress to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,” Dr Federoff said.Although further research is needed to validate the results and improve the accuracy, a test could be used commercially within a few years, especially to identify people at risk who could take part in clinical trials of prototype treatments, he said.“Such a test would identify high-risk individuals who might then be eligible to participate in clinical trials, testing therapies that might halt or prevent disease progression,” Dr Ferderoff said.“The pre-clinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention. Biomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful,” he said.“We consider our results a major step toward the commercialisation of a pre-clinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals.“We’re designing a clinical trial where we’ll use this panel to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer’s to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease,” he added.We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

334	A blood test can accurately predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease, according to U.S. researchers. They showed that testing levels of 10 fats in the blood could predict - with 90% accuracy - the risk of the disease coming on in the next three years. Their findings, published in Nature Medicine, will now be tested in larger clinical trials.Background:Blood test can predict Alzheimer's, say researchers [BBC]Blood test predicts Alzheimer's disease [CNN]View the discussion thread.Copyright © 2018.

335	"Brian DodsonAlzheimer's disease gradually destroys the brain and its function (Photo: US National Institutes of Health)A group of medical researchers working at Georgetown University, the University of Rochester and UC-Irvine have developed a blood test which predicts with 90 percent accuracy if an individual will develop Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) within three years. The test, which looks for a set of ten lipid markers, will allow treatments to be sought that may be effective during this early, asymptomatic stage of the disease.Alzheimer's disease (memory-related MCI is thought to consist of early Alzheimer's symptoms) is a scourge ravishing the elderly among us, with 35 million currently afflicted worldwide, a number that is expected to grow to 115 million by mid-century. Alzheimer's is universally fatal, with life expectancy of about seven years after diagnosis. Diagnosis is generally indirect, largely based on symptoms and ruling out other causes of dementia.There exist no treatments to cure or slow the inexorable progress of Alzheimer's. Some possibilities, however, have appeared in epidemiological studies, which show that people undergoing long term therapy with NSAIDS (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) are less likely to develop Alzheimer's.The lack of success in finding effective treatments may be that by the time a clear diagnosis can be made, the disease process is too far advanced to be interrupted. Medical researchers have previously found signatures of early Alzheimer's, but these have required examination of brain tissue or extraction of cerebrospinal fluid, preventing wide use as screening techniques.The new blood test detects the breakdown products of nerve cell membranes. The signature is a set of ten metabolic products of such disintegration, two of which are highly specific for prediction of Alzheimer's. The test requires determination of the concentration of the ten lipid biomarkers, as all of them are seen in blood of test subjects who do not develop Alzheimer's or MCI. Carried out on the blood plasma, the current version of the blood test requires a good deal of special equipment (including mass spectrographs). Research is ongoing to develop a simpler version that can be used for clinical research, and eventually for screening purposes.While the new Alzheimer's test has the potential for improving treatment and palliation of the disease, it will pose a new psychological hurdle associated with aging. Some people will want to know their fate, good or bad, so they can plan ahead for their future and the future of those close to them. Others will not be able to face the chance of discovering that they will experience the peculiar loss of self and dignity that is characteristic of Alzheimer's. We can only hope that effective treatment of incipient Alzheimer's disease is found.Dr. Howard J. Federoff of Georgetown University outlines the research in the video below.Source: Georgetown University1 / 1

338	"Photo: RIA NovostiA blood test can accurately predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease, according to US researchers. The disease is known to silently attack the brain for more than a decade before any symptoms emerge. Doctors think drug trials are failing because patients are simply being treated too late to make a difference.This is why discovering a test that predicts the risk of dementia is a major priority for the field.But now blood test for early Alzheimer’s disease may be on the horizon, according to a new small study that links substances found in blood to mental decline three years later.In the beginning, the researchers knew they wanted to find a blood test to detect Alzheimer's but didn't know what specifically to look for. Should they examine patients' DNA? Their RNA? Or should they look for the byproducts of DNA and RNA, such as fats and proteins?Researchers at Georgetown University in Washington DC decided to start with fats, since it was the easiest and least expensive.They analysed blood samples from 525 people over the age of 70 living near Rochester, New York, and Irvine, California as part of a five-year study.They developed a test that looks for 10 substances in the blood known as cell membrane lipids — substances that they believe may be connected to the breakdown of certain cells in the brain. They took 53 of them who developed Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment and compared their blood with 53 who stayed mentally agile.They found differences in the levels of 10 lipids, or fats, between the two groups.And when the research team looked in the other blood samples, those 10 markers of Alzheimer's could predict who was likely to enter mental decline in the following years.What they found was that people who had lower levels of these substances — even if they showed no signs of Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment — were more likely to develop mental decline within three years. The test, in fact, predicted this with more than 90 percent accuracy.Their findings, published in Nature Medicine, will now be tested in larger clinical trials.Experts said the results needed to be confirmed, but such a test would be ""a real step forward"".The number of people living with dementia stands at 44 million around the globe and is expected to treble by 2050.“The principle difference is we actually looked at individuals without symptoms, tracking them to see if they developed the disease,” said Dr. Howard Federoff, vice president of health sciences at Georgetown University and lead author of the study published today in the journal Nature Medicine. “No other study has done this.”Howard Federoff told the BBC: ""I think there is a huge need for a test.""But we must look at larger numbers of people before this could be used in clinical practice.""It is not clear exactly what is causing the change in fats in the blood, but it could be a residue of the early changes in the brain.Prof Federoff said slowing the pace of the disease could have a huge impact: ""Even a short delay of symptoms will have a tremendous economic benefit just in terms of the cost of care.""Dr Simon Ridley, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said the findings were ""encouraging"" and that a blood test would be a ""real step forward"".He added: ""To test the effectiveness of potential new drugs, it's important to be able to recruit people to clinical trials in the early stages of the disease, when such treatments are most likely to be effective.""If confirmed, these results could also aid efforts to develop better tools for diagnosing Alzheimer's - allowing people with the disease to access crucial support and existing treatments sooner.""“It is interesting and exciting,” said Dr. Mary Sano, director of the Alzheimer Disease Research Center at the Mount Sinai Hospital. “But more work has to be done.”Dr. Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific operations at the Alzheimer’s Association, agreed.“It is intriguing research, but it is still too preliminary for use in the doctor’s office,” she said. She added, however, that the quest for a simple blood test to look for signs of early disease is a crucially important one.The number of Americans with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias will grow as an increasing percentage of the U.S. population ages. It’s estimated, in fact, that by 2025 the number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer’s disease will reach approximately 7 million — a 40 percent increase from the estimated 5.1 million currently affected.Though much work still needs to be done, it is hoped the test will someday be available in doctors' offices, since the only methods for predicting Alzheimer's right now, such as PET scans and spinal taps, are expensive, impractical, often unreliable and sometimes risky, experts say.""This is a potential game-changer,"" said Dr. Howard Federoff. ""My level of enthusiasm is very high.""He and his team plan to try out this test in people in their 40s and 50s. If that works, he says, that would be the ""holy grail,"" because then researchers could try experimental drugs and treatments in a group that's almost sure to get the disease. That would speed research along immensely.Plus, people could get a heads up that they were probably destined to get Alzheimer's. Although some people might not want to know that they're destined for a horrible disease, others might be grateful for the warning. The Alzheimer's Society's Dr Doug Brown also said the test could pose ethical challenges.""If this does develop in the future people must be given a choice about whether they would want to know, and fully understand the implications.""""I think it's a very personal decision,"" Federoff said. ""It would have to be thought through on multiple dimensions. Patients and their families would have to be counseled.""Other research teams are looking at other possible tests for Alzheimer's. The need for a screening test of some kind for Alzheimer's has never been greater."	Health

For decades, Alzheimer's disease researchers have been looking for a way to predict the disease in advance that isn't incredibly invasive or expensive. Now a group of scientists at Georgetown University say they might have found it.   The study, published in Nature Medicine, looked at hundreds of elderly adults who were cognitively normal, trying to find a difference between those who went on to develop Alzheimer’s disease or other cognitive impairment and those who didn't.   What they came up with was a blood test looking at 10 lipids, or fat molecules, that was able to predict who would develop the disease within two to three years with 90 percent accuracy.   Currently, the only tests available to predict Alzheimer's disease are either expensive, like brain scans in an MRI, or painful, like spinal taps, so few people get tested before symptoms appear. (Via Wikimedia Commons / Liz West, DocP)   Alzheimer’s disease is a growing problem in the U.S. More than 5 million people have the disease, and that number's expected to grow to more than 7 million by 2025.   And while the CDC currently lists Alzheimer’s disease as the sixth-leading cause of death in the U.S. with 83,000 deaths per year, a study from Rush University released last week show that number may be much higher, rivaling the half million deaths per year of cancer and heart disease.   And there's no cure. What's worse, the new study's lead author, Dr. Howard Federoff, says even the treatments we do have just aren't very effective.   ""One of the reasons for this may be that the stage in which they were evaluated, which is in patients who already have the disease, may be the wrong stage."" (Via Georgetown University)   The hope is that a simple blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease patients years before symptoms emerge could open the flood gates of research into new, early treatments. For that, Federoff tells CNN he considers this study the single most important finding he's ever made.   The new blood test still needs to be evaluated by the scientific and medical communities before it becomes widespread, which would likely take a minimum of two years.

ELEANOR HALL: Researchers in the United States say they've make a breakthrough on dementia, with a blood test that can predict the onset of the disease in someone within three years.Global cases of dementia are expected to soar from 44 million people today to 135 million by 2050.The research team which conducted the five-year study is based at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.Co-contributor Howard Federoff is professor of Neurology at Georgetown University Medical Centre, and he spoke about the study to Alison Caldwell.HOWARD FEDEROFF: The work that we did was trying to understand in individuals who were elderly - in this case 70 years of age - whether we could identify which of those individuals would go on in a few short years to either develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's.So the way that we did this is: we enrolled cognitively normal 70-year-old people and then we followed them, using a battery of neuro-cognitive tests. Blood was drawn at the beginning when they entered the study, when they were cognitively normal. And then blood was drawn on follow-up, including when a subset of them developed cognitive impairment.The way that the study was designed was that we would go and examine the blood of the individuals who went on to what we call ""phenoconvert"" and compare those with those who remained cognitively normal.And what we found and we reported in Nature and Medicine is that 10 blood lipids, or fats, were lowered in individuals who were going to go on to develop cognitive impairment.The second part of the study was really to validate that observation - these 10 lipids or fats - to ask in a different group of individuals, ""How good would that 10-lipid test determine whether those individuals would go on to cognitive impairment?"" And in that case we were able to predict with 90 per cent accuracy their subsequent emergence of cognitive impairment.ALISON CALDWELL: This is what everyone's looking for: is a test that could show these things. How confident are you that this could really be used broadly?HOWARD FEDEROFF: Well, I think that is a key question and, you know, we've done a study. And as I said, we discovered and then validated. But it's imperative that our results be replicated on larger numbers of individuals.And then we would be interested in knowing whether individuals who might be younger than 70 years of age, whether they might test positive and then subsequently have the later emergence of Alzheimer's.So more validation is absolutely essential before we will know whether this test and this particular set of 10 lipids or fats is going to turn out to be useful and could imagine be translated into a routine clinical test that one's doctor could order.ALISON CALDWELL: I mean, what's the benefit really of knowing that somebody could develop dementia within three years?HOWARD FEDEROFF: I have seen this through two different lenses. The first, really, relates to my interest as an investigator or as a clinical scientist. We are as a larger community trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. And quite disappointingly the Alzheimer investigators have tested a number of promising drug candidates and they have all thus far failed to slow disease progression or even to have an impact on symptoms.And so we're interested in knowing, if we have a test that can find individuals who might then go on to develop Alzheimer's: could we imagine a clinical trial where those who are at high risk but not yet clinically affected, whether a drug can be used to test whether it might delay or perhaps even prevent the emergence of symptoms?And the second, I think, is really one that will fall into the realm - again, assuming that it is a test that migrates into a routine clinical laboratory setting - this will be something that patients and their families would want to be counselled before agreeing that the loved one who might have a questionable risk for Alzheimer's would have their blood drawn and then how to manage a positive test, you know, at the family level with the loved one.So I think that that issue really falls into the category of: one, ethics - a judgement about how to manage a positive test; and then some people, I think, would want to know and be able to plan the next several years so that they could live the most productive lives and be able to do whatever is necessary to make that transition.ELEANOR HALL: That's professor Howard Federoff from the Georgetown University Medical Center.And his study on dementia was published in the journal Nature and Medicine today. He was speaking to Alison Caldwell.

  SCIENTISTS have developed a new blood test that could detect whether or not a person will develop dementia within three years.

  Changes in the blood may signify Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stages, researchers found.

  A new study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, identified that 10 molecules in blood could be used to predict with at least 90% accuracy whether people would go on to develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.
Loading article content
  It is the first research that has been able to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between people with Alzheimer's disease before the symptoms occur and people who will not go on to develop the condition.

  The finding has the potential for developing treatment strategies for Alzheimer's at an earlier stage - when therapy would be more effective at slowing or preventing onset of symptoms, the authors said. A clinical trial is now being planned.

  Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Alzheimer's disease begins to develop long before symptoms such as memory loss appear, but detecting the disease at this pre-symptomatic stage has so far proved difficult.

  ""More work is needed to confirm these findings, but a blood test to identify people at risk of Alzheimer's would be a real step forward for research.""

  Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer's Society, added: ""Having such a test would be an interesting development, but it also throws up ethical considerations. If this does develop in the future, people must be given a choice about whether they would want to know.""

Elderly people dance on a street during the International Day of Older Persons in Sao Paulo's Avenida Paulista October 1, 2013. — Reuters picPARIS, March 10 ― Researchers in the United States say they have developed a prototype blood test that can tell with 90-per cent accuracy whether a healthy person will develop Alzheimer’s disease within three years.
	The test looks for 10 signatures of fatty proteins called lipids, according to a study published yesterday in the journal Nature Medicine.
	It could help families of people developing the cognitive disorder make early decisions on how best to care for them and may also aid the search for treatment, the authors said.
	Several years of clinical trials are likely to be needed to assess the prototype technique, the first blood “biomarker” to predict the tragic degenerative disease.
	Alzheimer's, caused by toxic proteins that destroy brain cells, is a currently incurable and fatal degenerative disease.
	Around 35 million people have the disease, a tally that is expected to reach 115 million people by 2050, according to the World Health Organization.
	“Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,” said Howard Federoff, a professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Centre in Washington.
	It could also help efforts to treat the disease, he said in a press release.
	Attempts to develop drugs for Alzheimer’s have failed possibly because they are tested when the disease has progressed too far, Federoff said.
	These treatments may have a better chance of braking or reversing the disease if they are trialled at a much earlier stage, he said.
	The researchers started by taking blood samples from 525 healthy volunteers aged 70 and older.
	Three years later, they looked at a group of 53 volunteers who had developed symptoms of early Alzheimer’s or a memory-affecting condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
	The blood samples from this group were compared against the samples from 53 otherwise healthy volunteers to see what the difference was.
	From this, the scientists spotted the 10 tell-tale lipid proteins, which appear to be metabolised residues of brain cell membranes. ― AFPReuters Video: ‘Three Billboards’ takes top SAG awardBloomberg Video: Tencent backed super-app emerges to rival its own WeChatBloomberg Video: iPhone update will let you disable battery throttling featureSee Anna Faris in ‘Overboard’Bloomberg Video: How to make a surfboardBloomberg Video: Apple guru Munster doesn’t see iPhone conspiracyCopyright ©  2018 Malay Mail OnlineAbout Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services"	Health

A BLOOD test for Alzheimer's capable of predicting whether a person will develop dementia has been developed in a breakthrough hailed by campaigners.
The test could ultimately lead to successful treatments that would halt or even prevent the disease, scientists said.The research found that biomarkers in the blood could be used to forecast whether a person would develop Alzheimer's disease within three years with a 90pc level of accuracy.Charities said last night that the findings from the American trial were encouraging.However, they also warned of ethical dilemmas and said patients must be given a choice about whether they wanted to receive potentially devastating news about their future.Jeremy Hunt, Britain's health secretary, told an international summit on dementia last month that the development of such tests could constitute ""a massive step forward"" in the battle against the disease.Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer's Society, said: ""This is a really welcome development – it takes us a step closer to something that could impact on the lives of thousands of people with dementia.""PREDICTThe research, published in the journal 'Nature Medicine', identified 10 molecules in the blood that could be used to predict with at least 90pc accuracy whether people went on to develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's.It is the first study to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between those who went on to suffer the disease, and those who remained ""cognitively normal"".Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre in Washington DC said blood tests to identify those likely to develop dementia could be used in major clinical trials within two years.Existing drugs for Alzheimer's disease work best if given early, and can lessen the symptoms, but do not slow overall progression of disease.Scientists believe the best hope of finding a breakthrough treatment that can slow or reverse progression of the condition may come if drugs can be given long before patients show signs of disease.Professor Howard Federoff, one of the study's authors, said that being able to predict the disease before it was symptomatic could offer a ""window of opportunity"" that could be critical to developing effective drugs to combat the condition before it took hold.Researchers said the results were ""a major step forward"" towards introducing large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals, and test possible treatments.(© Daily Telegraph, London)

349	"Scientists have developed a blood test that could detect whether or not a person will develop dementia within three years. Changes in the blood may signify Alzheimer’s disease in its earliest stages, researchers found. 
A new study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, identified 10 molecules in blood could be used to predict with at least 90% accuracy whether people will go on to develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. 
It is the first research which has been able to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between people with Alzheimer’s disease before the symptoms occur and people who will not develop the condition. 
The finding has potential for developing treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s at an earlier stage — when therapy would be more effective at slowing or preventing the onset of symptoms, the authors said. 
Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre in the US examined 525 healthy participants aged 70 and over, and monitored them for five years. 
During the research 28 participants went on to develop the conditions and 46 were diagnosed at the start of the study. 
Mid-way through the research, the authors analysed 53 patients who already had one of the conditions and 53 “cognitively normal” people. 
They discovered 10 molecules which appeared to “reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease”. 
They then tested other participants’ blood to see whether these biomarkers could predict whether or not they would go on to develop the conditions. 
By measuring the presence of 10 compounds, the researchers could predict with 90% accuracy people that would go on to suffer from mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. 
“The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90% accuracy these two distinct groups: Cognitively normal participants who would progress to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,” said one of the study’s authors, Howard Federoff. 
“Our novel blood test... can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder. 
“The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention. Biomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics. 
“We consider our results a major step toward the commercialisation of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals. 
“We’re designing a clinical trial where we’ll use this panel to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer’s to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease.” 
Simon Ridley, head of research at UK charity Alzheimer’s Research, and a graduate of Trinity College Dublin said: “Detecting the disease at this pre-symptomatic stage has so far proved difficult. 
“More work is needed to confirm these findings, but a blood test to identify people at risk of Alzheimer’s would be a real step forward for research.”

351	" Experience us with dark themeA recent study conducted by researchers at the Georgetown University School of Medicine has shown that a simple blood test could potentially predict whether an elderly individual will suffer from dementia over the next few years.Researchers note that this new blood test has a ninety percent success rate that could help a lot of individuals detect problems earlier and determine better treatment options.Scientists from the university in Washington DC analyzed blood samples from 525 people over the age of 70 as part of a five-year study, according to the BBC.Fifty-three of the participants developed Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment and compared their blood with 53 who did not have memory issues.Findings showed a difference in the levels of 10 lipids or fats between the two groups.The test looks at the levels of 10 lipids that are located in the bloodstream, and takes these measurements and estimates if they have any impairments in them, mild or extreme. These 10 lipids have been known to play an important role in memory loss, as well as the decline of your ability to assess situations as we age-and potentially the beginnings of Alzheimer's disease.""We do not know why all 10 of those lipids are lower in individuals who are predisposed to go on to cognitive impairment,"" said study author Dr. Howard Federoff, executive dean of the Georgetown University School of Medicine. ""We can't directly link this to our current understanding of the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease.""Researchers stress the importance of catching certain health issues early in order to prevent problems that could be easily treated.What do you think?More information regarding the findings can be seen via the journal Nature Medicine. TagsHealthJoin the Conversation"	Health
352	It will still take some years before this test can be developed into a commercial formA simple test for Alzheimer’s disease that can accurately predict whether someone is going to develop this distressing condition could be seen as raising more problems than it is worth. Leaving aside its 90 per cent accuracy, which could lead to one in 10 people being given a “false positive” result, one may wonder what good could come from confirmation of a condition for which there is no cure.Would anyone welcome being told that they are going to develop – and very likely die from – an incurable disorder that will eventually rob them of their memories, emotions and personality over a period of many years?There is little doubt that Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia in general, is one of the most formidable health challenges facing Britain, and indeed the world, in the 21st century. Some 800,000 people in the United Kingdom already have some form of dementia, more than half of whom suffer from Alzheimer’s. With our increasing lifespans this figure is set to rise to more than a million within 10 years and by a further 1.7 million by mid-century. And all these people will need care for the rest of their lives – sometimes for several decades.At present, it is only possible to diagnose Alzheimer’s and dementia when the symptoms become apparent, which is long after the machinery of the brain has already begun to malfunction at a biochemical level.  However a simple blood test which  provides an early warning two or three years in advance of its onset has now been achieved by scientists at Georgetown University in  Washington. This is a considerable scientific breakthrough.It will still take some years before this test can be developed into a commercial form that is properly validated for false negative and false positive accuracy. Even so, some medical ethicists may wonder what good such a test will do given that there is no current effective treatment for Alzheimer’s.This is not the first time that medical science has been here. A blood test for HIV was available long before there was an effective treatment for Aids in the form of anti-retroviral drugs. As soon as it became obvious that Aids was not an inevitable death sentence, the HIV test was touted as a vital weapon against the disease because it identified those who needed therapy.This blood test for Alzheimer’s therefore should not be seen simply as a way of signalling the thumbs-up or thumbs-down for a possible death sentence. It should be welcomed rather as a means of better understanding this  complicated brain disease by giving scientists early warning of who is going to develop the condition.One in three of us will suffer dementia at some time over the age of 65. Being able to identify, at an early stage, which of us will go down this path could rapidly accelerate the rate of scientific discovery, leading to more effective therapies, whether they are based on drugs or some kind of early cognitive intervention to delay the onset of the decline.So we should not be afraid of this test for Alzheimer’s.

                 Read Full Bio→Walnuts are a natural food and play a prominent role in the popular Mediterranean diet. Over the years health advocates have extolled their many health benefits.Now, scientists in New York have completed an animal study that suggests another health benefit – reducing the risk, delaying the onset, slowing the progression of, or preventing Alzheimer's disease.The research carried out by the Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory at the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities (IBR) found significant improvement in learning skills, memory, reducing anxiety, and motor development in mice fed a walnut-enriched diet.The researchers think that might have something to do with the high antioxidant content found in walnuts. They speculate these antioxidants provided protection to the mouse brain, preventing the degeneration typically seen in Alzheimer's disease. Oxidative stress and inflammation are prominent features in this disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.""These findings are very promising and help lay the groundwork for future human studies on walnuts and Alzheimer's disease – a disease for which there is no known cure,"" said lead researcher Dr. Abha Chauhan. ""Our study adds to the growing body of research that demonstrates the protective effects of walnuts on cognitive functioning.""For the study the mice were fed dietary supplements with 6% to 9% walnuts, which is the equivalent of a human eating 1 to 1.5 ounces each day.It's estimated that someone in the U.S. develops Alzheimer's disease every 67 seconds, and that number is expected to escalate rapidly as the Baby Boom generation ages. By 2050, health experts say the number of people 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease may nearly triple, from 5 million to as many as 16 million, creating new urgency to find treatments or a cure.Walnuts are said to have other health and nutritional benefits, including reducing the risk of prostate and breast cancer. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) says there are a few dozen studies investigating cancer and whole walnuts, with many more on the compounds they contain.However, AICR says the current evidence is too limited to draw any conclusions about walnuts – or any nuts – and cancer risk.Walnut's healthy effect on the heart is better documented. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) says in the last 2 decades a number of clinical studies have evaluated the effects of walnut consumption on cardio-vascular disease (CVD) risk factors.According to NIH, walnuts can reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, both major risk factors for CVD.“The effect of walnuts on multiple CVD targets over relatively short periods of time supports recommendations for their inclusion in a heart-healthy diet,” NIH says.Walnuts have also been shown to be effective in weight control. They are a good source of fiber and make you feel full.At the same time, you need to be prudent with your walnut consumption because they are loaded with calories. A tablespoon of chopped walnuts contains about 50 calories.Walnuts are a natural food and play a prominent role in the popular Mediterranean diet. Over the years health advocates have extolled their many health benefits.Now, scientists in New York have completed an animal study that suggests another health benefit – reducing the risk, delaying the onset, slowing the progression of, or preventing Alzheimer's disease.The research carried out by the Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory at the New York State Institute for Bas...By James Limbach

                 Read Full Bio→An analysis of data previously gathered on more than 3,000 older people suggests that the use of certain blood pressure medications may reduce the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).The team of Johns Hopkins-led researchers found that people over the age of 75 with normal cognition who used diuretics, angiotensin-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors showed a reduced risk of AD dementia by at least 50%. In addition, diuretics were associated with 50% reduced risk in those in the group with mild cognitive impairment.However beta blockers and calcium channel blockers did not show a link to reduced risk, the scientists reported.The report was published in a recent edition of the journal Neurology.""Identifying new pharmacological treatments to prevent or delay the onset of AD dementia is critical given the dearth of effective interventions to date,"" says report author, Sevil Yasar, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine in the Department of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""Our study was able to replicate previous findings, however, we were also able to show that the beneficial effect of these blood pressure medications are maybe in addition to blood pressure control, and could help clinicians in selecting an antihypertensive medication based not only on blood pressure control, but also on additional benefits.""Alzheimer's disease is a rapidly increasing clinical and public health issue in the United States' aging population, and the most common cause of intellectual and social decline.Yasar and her colleagues conducted a ""post-hoc"" analysis of information gathered originally in the so-called Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS) study, a six-year effort to determine if use of the herb ginkgo biloba reduced AD risk.That study , a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial of 3,069 adults without dementia, aged between 75 and 96 years, began in 2000 and recruited participants from four U.S. cities: Hagerstown, Md.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Winston-Salem/Greensboro, N.C.; and Sacramento, Calif.Yasar said that while the GEMS trial showed no benefit of ginkgo biloba in reducing incidence of dementia, information was also available among the study participants related to their use of several classes of antihypertensive drugs.Extensive studies suggest that high blood pressure is a major risk factor for dementias including AD, and there had been suggestions that drugs used to control blood pressure conferred a protective effect on the brain in addition to controlling blood pressure.The question, she said, was which ones were associated with reduced AD dementia risk, and which were not.Yasar and colleagues looked at 2,248 of the GEMS participants. Of them 351 reported use of a diuretic, 140 use of ARBs, 324 use of ACE inhibitors, 333 use of calcium channel blockers and 457 use of beta blockers. The average age of this group was 78.7 years, and 47% were women.""We were able to confirm previous suggestions of a protective effect of some of these medicines not only in participants with normal cognition, but also in those with mild cognitive impairment,"" says Yasar. ""Additionally, we were also able to assess the possible role of elevated systolic blood pressure in AD dementia by placing those within each medication group in categories above and below systolic blood pressures of 140 mmHg, the standard cut-off reading for a diagnosis of hypertension,"" she said.Yasar cautioned that the analysis had its limitations, owing mostly to the fact that the data collected by the GEMS trial were not gathered to directly measure the effect of the drugs, and by the fact that it was impossible to tell with certainty how well each group of participants complied with their drug treatments. Nor did the research team have information on subjects' use of drugs prior to the study period.But, she said, ""the consistent pattern we saw of reduced risk of AD dementia associated with these medications warrants further studies, including the use of brain imaging, to better understand the biologic basis of these associations."" Such studies, she added, ""could lead to identification of new pharmacologic targets for preventive interventions to slow cognitive decline and possibly delay progression of AD dementia."" An analysis of data previously gathered on more than 3,000 older people suggests that the use of certain blood pressure medications may reduce the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).The team of Johns Hopkins-led researchers found that people over the age of 75 with normal cognition who used diuretics, angiotensin-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors showed a reduced risk of AD dementia by at least 50%.

                 Read Full Bio→Early detection is important in cognitive diseases like Alzheimer’s, and researchers are hard at work trying to find ways to diagnose these illnesses earlier.A neuroscientist at Florida Atlantic University says he has developed a simple, three-minute test to identify the onset of Lew Body disease (LBD), a little-understood condition but the second-most-common cognitive disease after Alzheimer’s.LBD affects more than 1.3 million Americans, but it is poorly recognized, meaning diagnosis is often significantly delayed. Patients with LBD simultaneously experience losses in cognitive function, mobility, and behavior.Actor Robin Williams had this form of dementia. So did NHL coach Alger Joseph “Radar” Arbour.“Most patients never receive an evaluation by a neurologist skilled in the diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, and significant delays and misdiagnoses occur in most patients with this disease,” said Dr. James E. Galvin, who developed what he calls the Lewy Body Composite Risk Score (LBCRS).The LBCRS is a brief rating scale that is completed by a clinician to measure the symptoms highly associated with the LBD. With the tool, which takes about three-minutes to administer, a clinician can determine the type of dementia affecting the patient.Results of a study deploying the LBCRS appear promising. In a real-world clinical setting, the LBCRS was able to discriminate between Alzheimer’s disease and LBD with 96.8 percent accuracy.“Early detection of Lewy body dementias will be important to enable future interventions at the earliest stages when they are likely to be most effective,” said Galvin. “Our study provides evidence-based methodology that will have applications in clinical practice, participation in clinical trials, prevention studies, community surveys, and biomarkers research.” Early detection is important in cognitive diseases like Alzheimer’s, and researchers are hard at work trying to find ways to diagnose these illnesses earlier.A neuroscientist at Florida Atlantic University says he has developed a simple, three-minute test to identify the onset of Lew Body disease (LBD), a little-understood condition but the second-most-common cognitive disease after Alzheimer’s.LBD affects more than 1.3 million Americans, but it is poorly recognized, me...By Mark Huffman

                 Read Full Bio→For the first time, a drug designed to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease will be tested in a major clinical trial, the first step in bringing the drug to market.Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say they are getting $7.5 million from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a Phase 3 trial of the drug levetiracetam, scheduled to start early next year.Levetiracetam is not a new drug. It has been commonly prescribed for more than a decade to treat epilepsy. Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Michela Gallagher and colleagues have shown that a form of the drug calms hyperactivity in the brain of patients with a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory impairment is greater than expected for a person’s age.Doctors believe it also greatly increases risk for Alzheimer’s dementia. More than 5.6 million Americans and 25 million people globally suffer from aMCI.Gallagher says scientists believe overactivity in aMCI is a strong predictor of who will ultimately get Alzheimer's, a progressive brain disease that is ultimately fatal.“We expect our upcoming trial to demonstrate efficacy in preserving cognition and memory in aMCI patients while delaying progression to the clinical stage of Alzheimer’s dementia,” Gallagher said.Because levetiracetam is already an approved drug for epilepsy, it will skip the first two phases of trials. In a Phase 1 trial, a drug is tested on a small group of people for safety. In a Phase 2 trial, it is tested on a small group to determine if it is effective and has harmful side effects.In a Phase 3 trial, a drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.If a drug passes a Phase 3 clinical trial, the FDA usually allows it to be marketed for the purpose for which it was tested.The trial will be carried out in a public-private partnership between the NIH’s National Institute on Aging, Johns Hopkins, and the biopharmaceutical company AgeneBio. Patients will receive a mild dose of levetiracetam, called AGB101, in an extended release once-a-day tablet at approximately one-fifth to one-twelfth of the dose most commonly prescribed for epilepsy. Other patients will receive a placebo. The trial is expected to last 18 months to two years.Other promising Alzheimer's treatments have yet to come to the clinical trial stage but appear to be in the pipeline. As we reported late last year, researchers at UCLA believe they are on the cusp of a breakthrough in which memory loss can not only be slowed but lost memories restored in patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.There has been an increased urgency associated with Alzheimer's research since the large Baby Boom population began entering the period of highest risk. While Alzheimer's is not a normal part of aging, the Alzheimer's Association says people age 65 and older are at the highest risk.   For the first time, a drug designed to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease will be tested in a major clinical trial, the first step in bringing the drug to market.Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say they are getting $7.5 million from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a Phase 3 trial of the drug levetiracetam, scheduled to start early next year.Levetiracetam is not a new drug.

Mormino, PhD, with Massachusetts General Hospital in Charlestown, Mass., says there is an early stage of the disease that can last a decade or more without the appearance of symptoms.“Given that current clinical trials are testing whether therapies can slow memory and thinking decline among people at risk for the disease, it is critical to understand the influence of risk factors before symptoms are present,” Mormino said.The study looked at people with dementia and those without it, assigning each a numeric score based on the presence of high risk genes. The participants were examined for common Alzheimer’s markers, including a decline in memory and thinking skills, clinical progression of the disease, and the volume of the hippocampus, which is the memory center of the brain.The research team next looked at any links between the risk score and hippocampus size in 1,322 healthy, younger participants between the ages of 18 and 35.Even among older people who had no dementia – but who had a higher genetic risk – there was a stronger likelihood of worse memory and smaller hippocampus at the start of the study.Over the three years of the study, a higher genetic risk score was also associated with greater longitudinal memory and executive function decline and clinical progression of the disease.The risk score was also linked to overall disease progression, with 15 of 194 participants who were cognitively normal at the start of the study developing mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. Of the 332 subjects with mild cognitive impairment at the start of the study, 143 developed Alzheimer’s disease after three years.Mormino concedes it was a small study, but she says further research could help doctors better identify people at high risk of dementia at a much earlier age and begin preventive treatments sooner.

                 Read Full Bio→Younger people likely don't spend a lot of time thinking about Alzheimer's Disease, but maybe they should -- especially women who are new mothers or are about to become mothers.A new study suggests that mothers who breastfeed run a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's and that longer periods of breastfeeding further reduces the riskThe report, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, suggests the link may have to do with certain biological effects of breastfeeding. For example, breastfeeding restores insulin tolerance which is significantly reduced during pregnancy, and Alzheimer's is characterized by insulin resistance in the brain.Although researchers used data gathered from a very small group of just 81 British women, they observed a highly significant and consistent correlation between breastfeeding and Alzheimer's risk. They argue that this was so strong that any potential sampling error was unlikely.At the same time, however, the connection was much less pronounced in women who already had a history of dementia in their family. The research team hopes the study -- which was intended merely as a pilot -- will stimulate further research into the relationship between female reproductive history and disease risk.The findings may point towards new directions for fighting the global Alzheimer's epidemic -- especially in developing countries where cheap, preventative measures are desperately needed.More broadly, the study opens up new lines of inquiry into understanding what makes someone susceptible to Alzheimer's in the first place. It may also act as an incentive for women to breastfeed, rather than bottle-feed -- something already known to have wider health benefits for both mother and child.""Alzheimer's is the world's most common cognitive disorder and it already affects 35.6 million people,” said Dr. Molly Fox of the Department of Biological Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, who led the study. “In the future, we expect it to spread most in low and middle-income countries. So it is vital that we develop low-cost, large-scale strategies to protect people against this devastating disease.""Previous studies have already established that breastfeeding can reduce a mother's risk of certain other diseases, and research has also shown that there may be a link between breastfeeding and a woman's general cognitive decline later in life. Until now, however, little has been done to examine the impact of breastfeeding duration on Alzheimer's risk.Fox and her colleagues interviewed 81 British women aged between 70 and 100, including both women with and without Alzheimer's. In addition, the team also spoke to relatives, spouses and caregivers.Through these interviews, the researchers collected information about the women's reproductive history, their breastfeeding history and their dementia status. They also gathered information about other factors that might account for their dementia -- for example a past stroke or brain tumor.Dementia status itself was measured using a standard rating scale called the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). The researchers also developed a method for estimating the age of Alzheimer's sufferers at the onset of their disease, using the CDR as a basis and taking into account their age and existing, known patterns of Alzheimer's progression. All of this information was then compared with the participants' breastfeeding history.Despite the small number of participants, the study revealed a number of clear links between breastfeeding and Alzheimer's. These were not affected when the researchers took into account other potential variables such as age, education history, the age when the woman first gave birth, her age at menopause,or her smoking and drinking history.The researchers observed three main trends:The trends were, however, far less pronounced for women who had a parent or sibling with dementia. In these cases, the impact of breastfeeding on Alzheimer's risk appeared to be significantly lower than for women whose families had no history of dementia.The study argues that there may be a number of biological reasons for the connection between Alzheimer's and breastfeeding, all of which require further investigation.One theory is that breastfeeding deprives the body of the hormone progesterone, compensating for high levels of progesterone which are produced during pregnancy. Progesterone is known to desensitize the brain's estrogen receptors, and estrogen may play a role in protecting the brain against Alzheimer's.Another possibility is that breastfeeding increases a woman's glucose tolerance by restoring her insulin sensitivity after pregnancy. Pregnancy itself induces a natural state of insulin resistance. This is significant because Alzheimer's is characterized by a resistance to insulin in the brain (and therefore glucose intolerance) to the extent that it is even sometimes referred to as ""Type 3 diabetes"".""Women who spent more time pregnant without a compensatory phase of breastfeeding therefore may have more impaired glucose tolerance, which is consistent with our observation that those women have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease,"" Fox concluded. Younger people likely don't spend a lot of time thinking about Alzheimer's Disease, but maybe they should -- especially women who are new mothers or are about to become mothers.A new study suggests that mothers who breastfeed run a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's and that longer periods of breastfeeding further reduces the riskThe report, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, suggests the link may have to do with certain biological effects of breastfeedi...By Mark Huffman

                 Read Full Bio→The last five years have witnessed promising breakthroughs in research into Alzheimer's disease, the fatal condition that robs its victims of their memory as they age. But a lot can happen getting from the scientific experiment level to an approved therapy.For example, at the beginning of 2013 researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported a promising new Alzheimer's treatment. They showed how a molecule called TFP5, when injected into mice with a disease that is the equivalent of human Alzheimer's, symptoms are reversed and memory is restored -- without obvious toxic side effects. Could this be a cure for a dread disease? We won't know for a while. The treatment must be subjected to a vigorous clinical trials, which presumably are underway. This is just one of the hopeful developments that have contributed to optimism that Alzheimer's might one day be a non-factor in the aging process.Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50 to 80 percent of dementia cases, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Since getting older is a major risk factor, Alzheimer's is a threat to the large Baby Boom generation.There are already a number of drugs available to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and some researchers are working on these existing therapies, to make them more effective. The Salk Institute, the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute and a number of other research entities have defined a key mechanism behind the disease’s progress, giving hope that a newly modified Alzheimer’s drug will be effective.In 2009 Stephen F. Heinemann, a professor in Salk’s Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, found that a substance called Alpha7 may help trigger Alzheimer’s disease.“Previous studies exposed a possible interaction between Alpha-7 nicotinic receptors, labeled ?7Rs, with amyloid beta, the toxic protein found in the disease’s hallmark plaques,” said Gustavo Dziewczapolski, a staff researcher in Heinemann’s lab. “We showed for the first time, in vivo, that the binding of this two proteins, ?7Rs and amyloid beta, provoke detrimental effects in mice similar to the symptoms observed in Alzheimer’s disease.”This week Metabolic Solutions Development Company presented promising results of its Phase 2a study of a new diabetes drug that may prove effective against Alzheimer's. The study found the drug maintained glucose metabolism in key regions of the brain associated with cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's.Although most research shows Alzheimer's is closely associated with the build-up of harmful plaques in the brain, other inquiries have also shown reducing the role of glucose metabolism in the brain also may play a role.A key breakthrough? Again, scientists say we may not know for a while, but they applaud the effort.""We are in urgent need of new approaches in Alzheimer's drug research because there are currently no approved therapies to halt or even slow progression of the disease,"" said Howard Fillit, MD, Executive Director and Chief Science Officer of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation.Last week researchers at the Yale School of Medicine reported what they called a breakthrough in understanding and curing Alzheimer's. The scientists have focused on a receptor called metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, or mGluR5, as the missing link in the chain of biological processes that lead to Alzheimer’s disease. While all of this is highly encouraging, the proof will be in clinical trials – and time is of the essence. Millions of people are dependent upon the results.Alzheimer’s disease is estimated to affect more than 26 million people worldwide – more than five million in the U.S. alone. It is only going to get worse as the huge Baby Boomer generation ages. Nearly 106 million people are projected to suffer form the disease by 2050.

                 Read Full Bio→Two new research studies have shed new light on who will be afflicted with dementia, like Alzheimer's disease, and why. They join the growing body of research that is giving doctors better insight to the aging-related disease that robs seniors of their memory. It's of growing concern since the large Baby Boom generation is now entering old age and is at risk.The first study, by researchers at the University of Exeter Medical School, links dementia with heavy alcohol consumption during middle age. It found that middle-aged adults with a history of problem drinking are more than twice as likely to suffer from severe memory impairment in later life.""We already know there is an association between dementia risk and levels of current alcohol consumption – that understanding is based on asking older people how much they drink and then observing whether they develop problems,” said lead author Iain Lang. “But this is only one part of the puzzle and we know little about the consequences of alcohol consumption earlier in life.”To find answers Lang and his team investigated the relatively unknown association between having a drinking problem at any point in life and experiencing problems with memory later in life.""This is a public health issue that needs to be addressed,” Lang said. “More research is required to investigate the potential harms associated with alcohol consumption throughout life.”The finding is particularly troubling in light of recent evidence that more middle-aged and elderly people are abusing alcohol. The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence says alcohol and prescription drug problems among adults 60 and older is one of the fastest growing health problems facing the country.It says thousands of older people who need treatment for alcohol dependence aren't receiving it.Meanwhile, an international study of 27,000 patients has established an unusual test to determine whether a patient is likely to develop dementia. The test measured how fast the subjects walked and answered a short series of questions. The slower the gait and the more wrong answers, the higher the risk of developing dementia.Scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who conducted the study, said people who failed the test were twice as likely as others to develop dementia within 12 years.What makes the test important, the researchers say, is that it does not rely on sophisticated or expensive equipment, making it accessible to physicians in remote regions of the world. Testing relies on measuring gait speed and asking a few simple questions about a patient's cognitive abilities, both of which take just seconds.""In many clinical and community settings, people don't have access to the sophisticated tests – biomarker assays, cognitive tests or neuroimaging studies – used to diagnose people at risk for developing dementia,"" said senior author Joe Verghese. ""Our assessment method could enable many more people to learn if they're at risk for dementia, since it avoids the need for complex testing and doesn't require that the test be administered by a neurologist.Early diagnosis, of course, is critical because it allows time to identify and possibly treat the underlying causes of the disease, which may delay or even prevent the onset of dementia in some cases.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to 5.3 million Americans—about 1 in 9 people age 65 and over – have Alzheimer's disease, the most common type of dementia. That number is expected to more than double by 2050 due to population aging.Two new research studies have shed new light on who will be afflicted with dementia, like Alzheimer's disease, and why.

However, previous studies on transgenic mice and rats that have the gene mutations only partially reproduce the problems caused by Alzheimer’s. The animals have memory problems and many plaques but none of the other hallmarks, especially neurofibrillary tangles and neuron loss.To address this issue, Dr. Town and his colleagues decided to work with a certain strain of rats.“We focused on Fischer 344 rats,” he said, “because their brains develop many of the age-related features seen in humans.”“This new rat model more closely represents the brain changes that take place in humans with Alzheimer’s, including tau pathology and extensive neuronal cell death,” said Roderick Corriveau, Ph.D., a program director at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The model, he said, “will help advance our understanding of the various disease pathways involved in Alzheimer’s onset and progression and assist us in testing promising interventions.” Rats engineered to have the mutant genes that are known to play a role in the rare, early-onset form of Alzheimer’s disease are being used in the effort to determine the cause of the disabling disease.A study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, says rodents that have the full array of brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease supports the idea that increases in a molecule called beta-amyloid in the brain causes the disease.“We believe th...By Truman Lewis

The Federal Trade Commission charged that the advertising was deceptive and that the marketers falsely claimed they had clinical proof that BrainStrong Adult improves adult memory.“Supplement marketers must ensure that adequate scientific proof supports their specific advertising claims,” said Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “When the results of a scientific study don’t match the hype, consumers are likely to be misled.”Since at least March 2011, i-Health and Martek have sold BrainStrong Adult for about $30 for a 30-day supply at major retail stores, including CVS Pharmacy, Walmart, Walgreens, and Rite Aid; and online through drugstore.com and Amazon.com. They advertised the product – which contains the Omega-3 fatty acid DHA – on television, on Twitter, and at www.brainstrongdha.com.In the television ad, a woman forgets why she walked into a room. Through a voice over, her dog tells the audience she is there to find her sunglasses, which are sitting on top of her head. Another voice over then asks, “Need a memory boost? Introducing BrainStrong…Clinically shown to improve adult memory.”The FTC's proposed administrative settlement covers any dietary supplement, food, or drug promoted to prevent cognitive decline or improve memory, or containing DHA. It bars the companies from claiming that any such product prevents cognitive decline or improves memory in adults unless the claim is truthful and supported by human clinical testing.The settlement also prohibits claims about the health benefits, performance, safety, or effectiveness of these products unless the claims are backed up by competent and reliable scientific evidence.Finally, the companies cannot claim they have clinical proof to support their claims when they do not.With millions of Americans already suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia and millions more approaching the age when they are most vulnerable, does it seem likely that a $30 nutritional supplement would do what some of the world's best scientists have been unable to do?Of course not but that didn't stop i-Health, Inc. and Martek Biosciences Corporation from advertising that their BrainStrong Adult dietary supplement could improve adult memory...By Mark Huffman

                 Read Full Bio→It has long been assumed that the combination of Alzheimer's disease and an aging Baby Boom generation will spell trouble. A recent study that was submitted at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference confirms that it will be pretty bad.The report projects that 28 million Boomers – Americans born between 1946 and 1964 – will develop Alzheimer's at some point. Researchers predict that the cost of treating them will consume nearly 25% of all Medicare spending by 2040.The report starts with the assumption that there will be no significant advancements in Alzheimer's treatment between now and then. Today, Alzheimer's remains a slowly developing disease that robs its victims of their memory before it is ultimately fatal. There is no known cure.If nothing is done by 2020, the projected Medicare costs of caring for Baby Boomers with Alzheimer's is projected to be $11.86 billion in 2014 dollars, making up 2.1% of total Medicare spending. By 2040, when Boomers are aged 76-94, the projected Medicare costs are expected to be $328.15 billion in 2014 dollars.""The risk of Alzheimer's increases with age, and as baby boomers get older, the number of people developing the disease will rise to levels far beyond anything we've ever seen before,"" said Keith Fargo, Alzheimer's Association Director of Scientific Programs & Outreach.It's unlikely that medical research will stand still as this disease ravages a generation. Fargo says there is a pipeline of experimental therapies that have the potential to delay the onset of Alzheimer's and perhaps even prevent the disease. Many will get an airing at the association's conference this week in Washington, DC.In fact, there have been a number of developments in the area of Alzheimer's research in the last few months. One of the more promising ones was revealed in October, when researchers said a novel and complex treatment had restored memory function in 9 out of 10 participants.The study, conducted jointly by the UCLA Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, is the first to suggest that memory loss in patients may be reversed, and that improvement can be lasting.The treatment consists of a 36-point therapeutic program involving comprehensive changes in diet, brain stimulation, exercise, optimization of sleep, specific drugs and vitamins, and many additional steps that affect brain chemistry.As we reported just last week, scientists in Texas have isolated a biomarker that may help doctors predict who will get Alzheimer's, allowing for early intervention.Fargo points to recent advances in the treatment of HIV, cancer, and heart disease, saying the same financial commitment made to battling those deadly diseases is needed to tame Alzheimer's disease.""Alzheimer's is extremely underfunded compared to the magnitude of the problem,” Fargo said. “If we're going to change the current trajectory of the disease, we need consistent and meaningful investments in research from the federal government to ensure a more robust pipeline.""   It has long been assumed that the combination of Alzheimer's disease and an aging Baby Boom generation will spell trouble. A recent study that was submitted at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference confirms that it will be pretty bad.The report projects that 28 million Boomers – Americans born between 1946 and 1964 – will develop Alzheimer's at some point.

                 Read Full Bio→It turns out there is a difference between the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and the disease itself.Good health and physical and mental exercise as you age may in fact delay the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms, but researchers writing in a medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology say it won't prevent the disease.The study centered around people who carry a gene linked to Alzheimer's, the so-called APOE4 gene. An estimated 20% of the U.S. population carries it.The researchers divided people with the gene into two groups. One group stayed mentally active in middle age and one didn't.The mentally active group had lower levels of proteins, called amyloid plaques, that can build up in brain tissue and lead to Alzheimer’s disease than those who did not stay mentally active.The difference was significant. The mentally active group had the same plaque build-up at age 79 that the non-active group had at 74.“Recent studies have shown conflicting results about the value of physical and mental activity related to the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and we noticed that levels of education differed in those studies,” study author Prashanthi Vemuri of the Mayo Clinic, said in a release. “When we looked specifically at the level of lifetime learning, we found that carriers of the APOE4 gene who had higher education and continued to learn through middle age had fewer amyloid deposition on imaging when compared to those who did not continue with intellectual activity in middle age.”Some patients are diagnosed with Alzheimer's when they are actually suffering from frontotemporal dementia, which delays the correct treatment for them.“Some people cannot tell frontotemporal dementia from Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr. Joseph Masdeu, director of the Nantz National Alzheimer Center at Houston Methodist Hospital, said in a release. “However, these diseases have different symptoms and treatments. And with advances in neuroimaging, we can see a clear difference in how frontotemporal dementia manifests in the brain.”The accumulation of the protein beta amyloid in Alzheimer's can lead to excess production of an abnormal form of the important brain protein, tau.But beta amyloid is absent in frontotemporal dementia, and a different abnormal form of tau is detected.“A misdiagnosis of Alzheimer’s can prevent a person with frontotemporal dementia from participating in future trials for this group of disorders” Masdeu said.Since potential Alzheimer’s treatments would not help a patient with frontotemporal dementia, misdiagnosed patients participating in Alzheimer’s clinical trials can skew that data and prevent the advancement of those treatments, Masdeu said.

Specifically, they found that the expression of a certain membrane protein called aquaporin-4 increased dramatically after a head injury and caused damage.While work on that project continues, other experts believe that aquaporin-4 may be a prime target for Alzheimer’s research. A study conducted by researchers from Oregon Health & Science University has revealed a connection between the protein and possible prevention of the brain disease. While it may not materialize into a lasting cure, the researchers believe that their work could contribute to future therapies and prevention strategies.""It suggests that aquaporin-4 might be a useful target in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Iliff, senior author of the study. ""However, we aren't under any illusion that if we could just fix this one thing, then we'd be able to cure Alzheimer's Disease.""In a broad sense, Alzheimer’s isn’t a disease that happens all at once – it takes time and is much more progressive. There is currently no cure for it, but several therapies have been developed that may be effective in slowing it down; the researchers believe that aquaporin-4 could provide another.Aquaporin-4’s functions as part of the brain's glymphatic system. Under certain conditions, it is the protein that allows cerebral-spinal fluid to enter the brain and wash away other proteins like amyloid and tau – the build up of which are main drivers of Alzheimer’s.The researchers believe that when the system regulating aquaporin-4 breaks down, amyloid and tau are allowed to build up unchecked, leading to nerve damage. They tested this theory by analyzing three groups of 79 donated brains – people younger than 60 with a history of Alzheimer’s, people younger than 60 without a history of any neurological disease, and people over 60 without Alzheimer’s.They found that aquaporin-4 levels were well organized and ordered in the brains of people without Alzheimer’s or a history of neurological disease, but older brains with Alzheimer’s had very disorganized aquaporin-4 levels. The researchers posit that Alzheimer’s may have developed in these brains due to decreased function to clear away harmful proteins.Last year, the researchers were given a $1.4 million grant from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to continue their research and develop new imaging techniques that could capture brain processes as they happened. The team’s full study has been published in JAMA Neurology.  Recently, researchers began developing a potential therapy for concussions, using an FDA-approved drug that helps reduce the harmful effects of swelling. Specifically, they found that the expression of a certain membrane protein called aquaporin-4 increased dramatically after a head injury and caused damage.While work on that project continues, other experts believe that aquaporin-4 may be a prime target for Alzheimer’s research.

354	"(Photo: MGN Online)(Photo: MGN Online)WASHINGTON — In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have developed a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease that predicts with astonishing accuracy whether a healthy person will develop the disease.Though much work still needs to be done, it is hoped the test will someday be available in doctors’ offices, since the only methods for predicting Alzheimer’s right now, such as PET scans and spinal taps, are expensive, impractical, often unreliable and sometimes risky.“This is a potential game-changer,” said Dr. Howard Federoff, senior author of the report and a neurologist at Georgetown University Medical Center. “My level of enthusiasm is very high.”The study was published in Nature Medicine.‘We were surprised’In the beginning, the researchers knew they wanted to find a blood test to detect Alzheimer’s but didn’t know what specifically to look for. Should they examine patients’ DNA? Their RNA? Or should they look for the byproducts of DNA and RNA, such as fats and proteins?They decided to start with fats, since it was the easiest and least expensive. They drew blood from hundreds of healthy people over age 70 living near Rochester, New York, and Irvine, California. Five years later, 28 of the seniors had developed Alzheimer’s disease or the mild cognitive problems that usually precede it.Scouring more than 100 fats, or lipids, for what might set this group apart, they found that these 28 seniors had low levels of 10 particular lipids, compared with healthy seniors.To confirm their findings, the researchers then looked at the blood of 54 other patients who had Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment. This group also had low levels of the lipids.Overall, the blood test predicted who would get Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment with over 90% accuracy.“We were surprised,” said Mark Mapstone, a neuropsychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center and lead author of the study. “But it turns out that it appears we were looking in the right place.”The ‘holy grail’The beauty of this test, Mapstone says, is that it caught Alzheimer’s before the patient even had symptoms, suggesting that the disease process begins long before people’s memories start failing. He says that perhaps the lipid levels started decreasing at the same time as brain cells started dying.He and his team plan to try out this test in people in their 40s and 50s. If that works, he says, that would be the “holy grail,” because then researchers could try experimental drugs and treatments in a group that’s almost sure to get the disease.

356	"The finding, published online today in Nature Medicine and to be featured in the April print issue, offers new hope for the development of drugs to delay or possibly prevent onset of the disease, for which there is currently no treatment. The numbers of people with Alzheimer’s are expected to explode – from 35.6 million worldwide today to an estimated 115.4 million by 2050.“This is a very exciting finding because it finally gives us a good opportunity to make clinically meaningful advances in Alzheimer’s disease research and treatment,” says the study’s senior investigator, Howard J. Federoff, MD, PD, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center.The Georgetown team also included Amrita K. Cheema, PhD, Massimo S. Fiandaca, MD, Xiaogang Zhong, PhD, Timothy R. Mhyre, PhD, Linda H. MacArthur, PhD, and Ming T. Tan, PhD.Federoff led a team of scientists that found a panel of 10 lipids—or fats—circulating in the blood could predict, with greater than 90 percent accuracy in the study population, who would experience symptoms of cognitive decline or Alzheimer’s disease within three years.  The five-year study followed 525 individuals in California and New York who were 70 years of age or older. Of the group, 46 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease at the time they enrolled, and 28 went from having normal cognitive function to an impaired memory status during the study period. The blood test revealed marked differences in lipids between those who developed cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s, and those who developed no signs of disease.Investigators chose this age group because they were the most likely to develop memory problems within five years.In addition to several Georgetown investigators, other team members include researchers from the University of Rochester, the University of California-Irvine, Rochester General Hospital, Unity Health System in Rochester, Temple University School of Medicine and Regis University School of Pharmacy in Denver.The team determined that the 10 predictive lipids were molecules emanating from the destruction of brain cells.The knowledge that a cognitively normal participant in a clinical trial possesses this telltale lipid profile will allow drug developers to see if experimental agents can prevent the onset of memory impairment at an earlier stage, Federoff says.“There have been many efforts to develop drugs that were thought to modify the history of Alzheimer’s disease and sadly, all of them have failed. One of the reasons for this is that the agents were tested in patients who already have the disease and that is the wrong stage to evaluate disease-modifying therapies,” Federoff says.While it is premature to know if treatment for a few years before the onset dementia can make a difference, Federoff notes that “for the first time, the potential for drug therapy can be tested in a smart and rigorous way.”This is the first in what is expected to be a series of studies that will compare the molecular state in the brains of individuals with and without early signs of dementia.The research team is conducting a systems biology analysis of everything from the plasma lipids — a straightforward quantitative test — to genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiles.They have sequenced the genome of every one of the participants included in this study, collecting 12 terabytes of data—or 12 trillion digital bytes of information. The researchers are closing in on what Federoff calls a “network of molecules that defines an at-risk individual.”“The story is getting a lot tighter and the Nature Medicine report is just the very first volley. My anticipation is that eventually we are going to be able to link all of those informational molecules into a coherent story that might even begin to address what is the underlying mechanism that puts people at risk,” Federoff says.One key finding is that the presence of the APOE4 gene, a known risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s, did not augment the diagnostic accuracy of the test.  This is important because it suggests that “in at-risk individuals, APOE is playing an insignificant small role” and that this new lipid test is “much more predictive.”As the researchers continue to refine their analysis, they are looking to test the efficacy of the lipid profile in more diverse populations.“When perfected, this very simple and inexpensive test can be conducted using the technology that exists in almost every clinical lab in the world,” Federoff says.  “Knowing you are at risk for cognitive impairment can be valuable for planning, but it is most beneficial if you can modify your risk — and that is what we all seek and now have a helping hand in finding,” he says.Federoff and Georgetown researchers Amrita K. Cheema and Massimo S. Fiandaca along with Mark Mapstone of the University of Rochester are named as co-inventors on a patent application filed by Georgetown and the University of Rochester related to the technology described. The National Institutes of Health (R01AG030753) and the Department of Defense (W81XWH-09-1-0107) funded the study.By Renee Twombly GUMC Communications

		Test to Predict Alzheimers Risk with 90% AccuracyReport in Nature Medicine on 
		discovery in study of seniors over age 70; NPR reports on consequences 
		of knowing  see 
		video in story
Dr. Howard Federoff, 
				right, led study at Georgetown University Medical Center to 
				discover blood test to predict Alzheimer's disease.
				See video below.March 9, 2014  If you are a senior 
		citizens over age 70 a new blood test can predict with 90 percent 
		accuracy if you will develop Alzheimers disease in the next two or 
		three years. The new discovery still must go through clinical testing 
		before being available for general use but now seniors will have to 
		consider if this is information they really want to know.The study, led by neurologist 
		Howard Federoff of Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington 
		DC, is published today in 

		Nature Medicine. He and his colleagues studied 525 
		seniors over the age of 70.They tested those in the study for 
		cognitive and memory ability and took their blood samples about once a 
		year over a five year period. They further studied the blood results of 
		53 with mild cognitive impairment  or AD  including 18 who developed 
		disease symptoms during the testing, and another 53 who remained 
		cognitively healthy.They found ten complex lipids, 
		known as phospholipids, that were present at consistently lower levels 
		in the blood of most people who had, or went on to develop, cognitive 
		impairment. The team validated the results in a set of 41 further 
		participants and determined the 90 percent accuracy.A report on the study today by
		
		National Public Radio says, The finding could lead to a quick and 
		easy way for seniors to assess their risk of Alzheimer's, says
		
Dr. Howard Federoff, 
		a professor of neurology at Georgetown University. And that would be a 
		game changer, he says, if researchers find a treatment that can slow 
		down or stop the disease.But because there is still no way 
		to halt Alzheimer's, Federoff says, people considering the test would 
		have to decide whether they are prepared to get results that could be 
		life-altering.He emphasizes that his results will 
		have to be validated by others and larger studies: We also have to look 
		at different age groups and a more diverse racial mix, and we need 
		longer study periods.Do we really want to know?Jon Hamilton, in his report on
		
		NPR, quoted and paraphrased Dr. Jason Karlawish, professor of medicine, medical 
		ethics and health policy, University of Pennsylvania, on the ethics of 
		being able to predict Alzheimers -
""That knowledge can be a good 
		thing. That's been shown among people who chose to be tested for a gene 
		that increases the risk of Alzheimer's.
""Knowing their risk of 
		developing cognitive impairment is very relevant to making plans around 
		retirement and where they live. So there is certainly a role 
		for knowing that information.
""On the other hand, people who 
		have the Alzheimer's gene and know it tend to rate their own memories as 
		worse than people who have the gene but don't know it. And 
		knowing you carry the gene also seems to hurt people's performance on 
		memory tests.
""But the biggest concern about Alzheimer's testing 
		probably has to do with questions of stigma and identity. How will other people interact with you if 
		they learn that you have this information? And how will you think about 
		your own brain and your sort of sense of self?
""The stigma and fear surrounding Alzheimer's may 
		decrease, though, as our understanding of the disease changes. Right now, people still tend to think that 
		either you have Alzheimer's disease dementia or you're normal, you 
		don't have it.
""But research has shown that's not really true. Alzheimer's is a bit like heart 
		disease. It starts with biological changes that occur years before 
		symptoms appear. And there is no bright line separating healthy people 
		from those in early stages of the disease."" There is not yet a good treatment 
		for Alzheimers disease, which affects 35 million people worldwide, 
		says Simon Lovestone, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, 
		who was quoted in the
		
		Nature Medicine report on the study. Several promising therapies have 
		been tested in clinical trials over the last few years, but all have 
		failed. However, those trials involved people who had already developed 
		symptoms. Many neuroscientists fear that any benefits of a treatment 
		would be missed in such a study, because it could be impossible to halt 
		the disease once it has manifested. We desperately need biomarkers 
		which would allow patients to be identified  and recruited into trials 
		 before their symptoms begin.>> Original report, associated

Scientists have developed a new blood test that they claim could detect whether or not a person will develop dementia within three years.Changes in the blood may signify Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stages, researchers found.A study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, identified 10 molecules in blood could be used to predict with at least 90% accuracy whether people will go on to develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's.It is the first research that has been able to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between people with Alzheimer's before the symptoms occur and people who will not go on to develop the condition.The finding has potential for developing treatment strategies for Alzheimer's at an earlier stage - when therapy would be more effective at slowing or preventing onset of symptoms, the authors said.Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre in the US examined 525 healthy participants aged 70 and over and monitored them for five years.During the research 28 participants went on to develop the conditions and 46 were diagnosed at the start of the study.Midway through the research, the authors analysed 53 patients who already had one of the conditions and 53 ""cognitively normal"" people.They discovered 10 molecules that appeared to ""reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's. They then tested other participants' blood to see whether these biomarkers could predict whether or not they would go on to develop the conditions.By measuring the presence of 10 compounds the researchers could predict with 90% accuracy people that would go on to suffer from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's (AD).""The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90% accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,"" said one of the study's authors, Professor Howard Federoff.""Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder.""The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention.

AN Alzheimer's test has been developed which could predict whether or not an apparently healthy person will develop dementia.
Scientists said the discovery of changes in the blood which signify the earliest stages of disease could herald a major breakthrough - potentially leading to successful treatment during a critical “window of opportunity” . The study found biomarkers in the blood could be used to forecast whether a person would develop Alzheimer’s disease within three years, with a 90 per cent level of accuracy. At an international summit on dementia last month, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said the development of such tests could constitute “a massive step forward” in the battle against the disease. Charities on Sunday said the findings from the new US trial were encouraging and could signify an important advance in dementia treatment. However, they also warned of ethical dilemmas ahead - and said patients must be given a choice about whether they wanted to receive potentially devastating news about their future. The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, identified 10 molecules in the blood which could be used to predict with at least 90 per cent accuracy whether people went on to develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. It is the first study to show differences in biomarkers in the blood between those who went on to suffer the disease, and those who remained “cognitively normal”. Researchers said blood tests to identify those likely to develop dementia could be used in major clinical trials within two years. Scientists from Georgetown University Medical Centre in the US examined 525 healthy participants aged 70 and over and monitored them for five years. They regularly analysed blood samples from 53 participants who developed dementia, comparing them with those from 53 “cognitively normal” people. When they tracked back, they found that the biomarkers could predict with 90 per cent accuracy whether participants went on to develop Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment. Professor Howard Federoff, one of the study’s authors, and professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Centre, said: “The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 per cent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future.” The researchers are now designing a further study in which those forecast with a high risk of Alzheimer’s disease are given access to experimental treatments which might delay or prevent the condition. One in three people will develop dementia in their lifetime, and a rapidly ageing population means numbers are forecast to double within two decades. More than 800,000 people in the UK have a form of dementia - most commonly Alzheimer’s disease - but Government estimates suggest that just half of cases receive a diagnosis. Existing drugs for Alzheimer’s disease work best if given early, and can lessen symptoms, but do not slow overall progression of disease. Scientists believe the best hope of finding a breakthrough treatment, which can slow or reverse progression of the condition, may come if drugs can be given long before patients show signs of disease. Prof Federoff said that being able to predict disease before it was symptomatic could offer a “window of opportunity” which could be critical to developing effective drugs to combat disease before it took hold. Researchers said they believed the results were “a major step forward” towards introducing large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals, and test possible treatments and preventative drugs. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at charity Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Alzheimer’s disease begins to develop long before symptoms such as memory loss appear, but detecting the disease at this pre-symptomatic stage has so far proved difficult. More work is needed to confirm these findings, but a blood test to identify people at risk of Alzheimer’s could be an important finding for research.” He said further studies were needed on larger groups of people, to see if treatments were more effective if given earlier. “These are encouraging findings, but it’s vital to continue investing in research to capitalise on results like these,” he said. Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “This is a really welcome development - it takes us a step closer to something that could impact on the lives of thousands of people with dementia, but we do need more research on larger groups and different populations.” He said “significant ethical considerations” would have to be taken into account in offering any such test, particularly in doing so when an effective treatment has yet to be found. “People must be given a choice about whether they would want to know, and whether they fully understand the implications of having such a test,” he said.

360	"A blood test that can predict who is
 about to develop Alzheimer's or related early memory loss up to two 
years before the first symptoms may be in early stages of development, 
researchers believe.Many 
scientists have tried, and failed, to come up with a test that can 
predict Alzheimer's. But this one, developed by teams at Georgetown 
University and the University of Rochester, seems especially accurate.""This is the first time a
 highly sensitive and specific test has been able to predict who will 
become demented,"" says Dr. Howard Federoff of Georgetown, who helped 
lead the research published in the journal Nature Medicine.""Sensitive
 and specific"" means the test misses very few people who did go on to 
develop Alzheimer's or the memory loss that precedes it. And there were 
no ""false negatives.""""We did not find any individual that didn't test positive that became demented,"" Federoff said.The need is urgent. Alzheimer's affects more than 5 million Americans and it's projected to soar to 13 million over the next 35 years. A study published earlier this month suggested it's a big killer, taking down more than 500,000 Americans every year.There's no cure and not even a good 
treatment. Many different approaches have been unsuccessful. ""It's 
frustrating,"" Federoff says. But Federoff and other experts think if 
people could be treated before they develop symptoms, before the brain 
damage is so bad, it might be possible to slow the onset of Alzheimer's.""They tried the therapies too late. We need to find people earlier,"" Federoff said.The first step would be a test that predicts who needs early treatment.Federoff
 and colleagues looked at the blood of 525 people aged 70 or over who 
had no symptoms of Alzheimer's at the start. They were all living on 
their own and generally healthy. They gave blood at the beginning of the
 five-year study and once a year after that.Over
 the five years, 74 of the volunteers developed either mild cognitive 
impairment or Alzheimer's, which can be diagnosed with psychological 
tests, brain scans or a spinal fluid test.Federoff's
 team analyzed their blood samples to see if there was any pattern at 
all of compounds that might change predictably in those who developed 
memory problems.There was. It 
was a pattern of 10 lipids — fat-like compounds — that changed in the 
people who went on to develop memory loss or Alzheimer's.""We're
 finding these lipids, 10 of them, that are highly predictive of who in 
the next two years will become cognitively impaired,"" Federoff said in 
an interview.The team is not exactly sure what the lipids mean. They may come from the debris caused when brain cells die.Brain
 cells don't die quietly, says Heather Snyder of the Chicago-based 
Alzheimer's Association. And there is a lot going on in Alzheimer's 
disease: buildups of protein called amyloid beta, tangles of nerves and 
also inflamed cells releasing signaling chemicals called cytokines, 
chemokines and destructive chemicals called reactive oxygen species.It's also known that Alzheimer's is somehow associated with blood fats. Studies link Alzheimer's risk with unhealthy cholesterol levels  and a gene mutation that affects cholesterol, one called APOE4, also affects Alzheimer's risk.However, this particular blood test seemed to have nothing to do with APOE4, Federoff says.As
 with any test, it will have to be tried out in a much larger group of 
people before anyone could think about developing it commercially.""This study addresses a critical 
need in the field, that of finding a relatively inexpensive and 
non-invasive biomarker to allow us to screen large groups of people,"" 
said Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic's Alzheimer's 
Disease Research Center. ""This study is an important step in that 
direction but needs to be validated on a larger group of subjects more 
representative of a more general aging population.""Federoff's team is also looking to see if they can predict memory loss even sooner than the two to three years this test did it.The
 test itself wouldn't be hard to do, he says. ""It's an easy approach,"" 
he said. ""The technology exists in almost any clinical lab.""Many people have tried to develop tests for Alzheimer's, including blood tests.""Many
 of those studies and those panels that are being identified are still 
very much in the early phases,"" says the Alzheimer's Association Snyder.
 ""They need to be validated and confirmed in much larger populations,"" 
Snyder added in a telephone interview.Part
 of the problem is that scientists don't even agree on what causes 
Alzheimer's. ""There is so much that we don't understand about what is 
happening, and one is what are those earliest changes and why,"" she 
said.It's not even that easy to 
diagnose Alzheimer's in people with symptoms. ""Current biological 
markers for early disease, including levels of abnormal proteins in 
cerebrospinal fluid, structural and functional MRI of the brain, and 
brain PET amyloid imaging are limited by their inability to specifically
 diagnose (‘rule in') the disease, or because they are invasive and can 
be expensive,"" notes Maria Carrillo, Alzheimer's Association vice 
president of medical and scientific relations.Currently, people who worry they
 might be developing Alzheimer's are often just left to fret, without 
knowing if they really ought to be getting their affairs in order.The victim told deputies that a slender white female  entered the home on Wallaceville School Road and shot him.The victim told deputies that a slender white female  entered the home on Wallaceville School Road and shot him.On Thursday, Channel 3 learned that the Marion County Sheriff's Office vehicle stolen by Halfacre did not crash into a storefront.On Thursday, Channel 3 learned that the Marion County Sheriff's Office vehicle stolen by Halfacre did not crash into a storefront.WRCB-TV

	A group of scientists claim it has developed a revolutionary test that can predict if someone will develop Alzheimer's disease.
	The researchers told CNN they were able to find the connection through testing lipids levels in the blood. The testing found the blood test predicted who would get the degenerative brain disease that kills about half a million people a year with more than 90% accuracy — even if the patient has not exhibited any symptoms, the doctors said.
	""This is a potential game-changer,"" Dr. Howard Federoff, senior author of the report and a neurologist at Georgetown University Medical Center, told the station. ""My level of enthusiasm is very high.""
	The next step is to test people in their 40s and 50s, and then they could try experimental drugs to help ward off the illness. The patients could also be warned if they are a candidate to have the disease when they are older.
	That, of course, could be very difficult to learn, the doctors said.
	""I think it's a very personal decision,"" Federoff told CNN. ""It would have to be thought through on multiple dimensions. Patients and their families would have to be counseled.""

363	" The first sequencing of a human genome began in 1990 and was completed in 2003 at a cost of $2.7 billion. Now, whole genome sequencing (WGS) can cost as little as $1,000, with the procedure taking just days. When sequencing an organism's DNA, the order of DNA nucleotides is documented by machines. This ordering is transcribed in letters - A, C, G and T - which each represent a particular piece of DNA (adenines, guanines, thyamines and cytosines). The human genome is made up of 3 billion of these letters. Using the genome sequence, scientists are able to find genes much more easily. In a clinical setting, it is hoped that WGS could quickly and accurately reveal the genetic basis of family diseases. Even in healthy individuals, it is believed that WGS can uncover potentially important information about a person's genes and their health. For example, Medical News Today recently reported on new research that looked at using WGS to select embryos for in vitro fertilization. However, it is rare that the clinical findings of WGS are reported. Therefore, scientists do not have much information on how effective or reliable WGS is as a clinical tool. Three Main Problems in Using WGS to Diagnose Disease or Risk of Disease Researchers from the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease in California recruited 12 adult volunteers who underwent WGS between Nov. 2011 and March 2012. The results were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team, and the researchers published their findings in the journal JAMA. The study identifies three problems with using WGS in a clinical setting. Firstly, the study found that WGS' coverage of inherited-disease genes was incomplete. Being able to accurately map the important parts of the genome for diseases that run in families is more difficult than mapping other sections of the genome. Secondly, the researchers could not reproduce all of the genetic variations that were detected, and the experts in the study could not agree on which types of variation were important for disease. Thirdly, the experts in the study disagreed on which of the WGS results were most meaningful, or ""clinically reportable."" Consequently, the authors conclude that although the analytical validity of WGS is improving, there are still technical challenges with assessing individual results. Although the financial cost of the sequencing has made the technology more accessible, there are still ""considerable"" human resource needs in order to interpret and validate the data returned by WGS. Writing in a linked comment, JAMA associate editor Dr. William Gregory Feero says that studies like this ""provide a glimpse of what is possible but demonstrate that much remains to be learned about previously assumed to be 'known' information as well as myriad 'known unknowns' and 'unknown unknowns' before truly successful widespread integration can occur."" He adds: ""A question facing potential early adopters of genome sequencing as an adjunct to patient care is whether or not having WGS data, at this time, will decrease uncertainty and improve outcomes or merely exponentially increase the complexity of clinical care."""

364	"Mark Tuschman description of photoWhole-genome sequencing has been touted as a game-changer in personalized medicine. Clinicians can identify increases in disease risk for specific patients, as well as their responsiveness to certain drugs, by determining the sequence of the billions of building blocks, called nucleotides, that make up their DNA.Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered that although life-changing discoveries can be made, significant challenges must be overcome before whole-genome sequencing can be routinely clinically useful. In particular, they found that individual risk determination would benefit from a degree of improved sequencing accuracy in disease-associated genes. Furthermore, up to 100 hours of manual assessment by professional genetic counselors or informatics specialists is required for detailed genome analysis.Although the technique was once prohibitively expensive, plummeting costs have been widely expected to rapidly usher whole-genome sequencing into the arena of mainstream health care. However, the researchers’ findings indicate that clinical advances from whole-genome sequencing are, at least in the near future, likely to be significantly more expensive and labor-intensive than some patients and clinicians may have been led to believe.Doing it right“We need to be very honest about what we can and cannot do at this point in time,” said Euan Ashley, MD, associate professor of medicine and of genetics, one of three senior authors of the paper. “It’s clear that if we sequence enough cases, we can change someone’s life. But with this opportunity comes the responsibility to do this right. Our hope is that the identification of specific hurdles will allow researchers in this field to focus their efforts on overcoming them to make this technique clinically useful.”The paper was published March 12 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Michael Snyder, PhD, professor and chair of genetics, and Thomas Quertermous, MD, professor of medicine, also share senior authorship of the paper. Postdoctoral scholar and cardiology fellow Frederick Dewey, MD, genetic counselor Megan Grove, CGC, and postdoctoral scholar Cuiping Pan, PhD, share lead authorship of the paper.The researchers analyzed the whole genomes of 12 healthy people and took note of the degree of sequencing accuracy necessary to make clinical decisions in individuals, the time it took to manually analyze each person’s results and the projected costs of recommended follow-up medical tests.“This has been an important project for the Stanford team for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it represents the initial genetics effort to make use of the Stanford GenePool Biobank,” said Quertermous, the William G. Irwin Professor in Cardiovascular Medicine. GenePool was recently launched to promote genomic research in a clinical setting and to improve patient care; the 12 people in the study were the first participants in the effort.“GenePool gives Stanford patients the opportunity to participate in ground-breaking research and is a great opportunity for collaboration among Stanford translational researchers,” Quertermous said.Time and moneyThe researchers estimated a cost of about $17,000 per person to sequence the genome and interpret and analyze the average of nearly 100 genetic variations deemed important enough for follow-up in each person. Each variation required approximately one hour of investigation to assess the relevant scientific literature and determine whether the change was indeed likely to modify disease risk in the individual. After this process, the researchers were left with approximately two to six results they felt could be clinically important; doctors who reviewed the results as part of the study suggested follow-up tests that carried costs of less than $1,000 per person.Michael SnyderIn one of the 12 cases, however, the payoff of this intensive process was big: A woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer learned she carried a potentially deadly deletion in her BRCA1 gene. After confirmation of the finding in a clinical cancer genetics setting, she was able to take action to reduce her future risk for breast and ovarian cancer.“Although there are clearly challenges in bringing whole-genome sequencing into the clinic, this finding was clearly medically significant,” Dewey said. “It’s not possible to predict from a study of 12 people how often this type of clinically actionable discovery will occur, but it definitely supports the use of this technology.”One significant challenge is the need to decisively determine the sequence of genes already known to be associated with disease. Dewey and his colleagues found that commercially available whole-genome sequencing does not achieve the accuracy necessary to identify every nucleotide in about 7 to 16 percent of genes known to be associated with increased disease risk. While a degree of uncertainty is allowable during studies of populations, which look for trends by comparing hundreds of genomes, it makes it impossible to make accurate predictions about one individual’s health status.“These off-the-shelf genome sequencing techniques were developed to provide generally good coverage of most of the genome,” Dewey said. “But there are some regions that remain to be covered well that we care very deeply about. We still need to supplement this information with additional sequencing in some regions to make clinically usable decisions.”Dangerous or normal?The study may affect a recent recommendation by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics that so-called “incidental findings,” a term used to describe the discovery of potentially disease-associated variations identified during sequencing conducted for an unrelated medical reason, be routinely reported to an individual. Uncertainties or inaccuracies in the sequences of the 56 genes identified by the college could either give the appearance that a dangerous variation is normal, or cause unnecessary alarm and follow-up tests if a gene is mistakenly deemed to have a dangerous mutation.Thomas QuertermousIn particular, the two sequencing technologies used in the study — one from San Diego-based Illumina Inc. and one from Mountain View-based Complete Genomics Inc. — had difficulty in reliably identifying regions of the genome with small insertions or deletions of nucleotides. These types of changes are particularly important because they can cause the abrupt termination of a protein coding sequence within the DNA.“It’s ironic, and slightly sobering, that we struggle the most in identifying insertions and deletions — those changes in the genome that are most impactful,” Ashley said.Once the sequences have been determined, it’s necessary to figure out which changes, or variants, are likely to be important. Dewey and his colleagues found that the amount of manual labor involved in sifting through the many variants in each individual approached 100 hours. That’s because, with the exception of a few well-known mutations, there is no standard way to assess the potential health impact of each change. In the study, three genetic counselors, three clinicians specializing in informatics and one medical pathologist examined each variant and assessed the relevant medical literature (including publications on animal and human studies, as well as genetic databases) to determine potential disease risk.These challenges are particularly striking in the absence of a specific diagnostic question. “It remains significantly harder to use whole-genome sequencing for disease prediction than for disease diagnosis,” said Dewey.Follow-up testsVariants expected to have potential health consequences were then shared with three primary care physicians and two medical geneticists, who independently studied the results and recommended possible follow-up tests for each person. In general, the projected costs for the tests were less than the researchers predicted  — ranging from $351 to $776.“Some experts in this field feel that this type of testing causes more harm than good, and may lead to very expensive follow-up tests,” said Snyder, who is the Stanford W. Ascherman, MD, FACS, Professor in Genetics. “So it was interesting that costs were projected to be relatively modest.”Although some of the findings of the study are somewhat sobering, the authors are confident that the field of whole-genome sequencing is worth pursuing. Sequencing technology is evolving, and the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Clinical Genome Resource, or ClinGen, is meant to help speed the identification of clinically important variants and reduce the burden of manual investigation. Stanford professor of genetics Carlos Bustamante, PhD, is a co-principal investigator on a ClinGen project to improve predictions of disease-associated variants in a variety of populations.“Our intention in doing this analysis was to draw a line describing where we are with this technology at this point in time and identify how best to move forward,” Ashley said. “Things are becoming more clear, and the challenges to bringing this technique to the clinic are becoming crystallized. Whole-genome sequencing has the power to be absolutely transformative in the clinic.”Other Stanford authors involved in the research include genetic counselors Colleen Caleshu CGS, and Kerry Kingham, CGC; senior research scientist Hassan Chaib, PhD; clinical instructor Jason Merker, MD, PhD; graduate student Rachel Goldfeder; associate professor of pediatrics Greg Enns, MD; clinical associate professor of family and community medicine Sean David, MD, PhD; clinical assistant professor of medicine Neda Pakdaman, MD; professor of genetics Kelly Ormond, CGC; senior research scientist Teri Klein, PhD; assistant director of PharmGKB Michelle Whirl-Carrillo, PhD; clinical associate professor of medicine Kenneth Sakamoto, MD; instructor Matthew Wheeler, MD, PhD; associate professor of pediatrics Atul Butte, MD, PhD; associate professor of medicine James Ford, MD, PhD; professor of medicine Linda Boxer, MD; professor of medicine John Ioannidis, MD, PhD; professor of cardiology Alan Yeung, MD; professor of bioengineering, of genetics, and of medicine Russ Altman, MD, PhD; and assistant professor of medicine Themistocles Assimes, MD, PhD.The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants HL094274-01A2, P50HG003389-05, R24GM61374, R01GM079719 9, U01HG004267-03 and DP2OD004613), the Breetwor Family Foundation and the LeDucq Foundation.Dewey is a stockholder and member of the scientific advisory board of Personalis Inc, a privately held genome interpretation company, and he receives royalties for patented technology related to genome sequencing.

366	"Sunshine and clouds mixed. A few flurries are possible. High 29F. Winds WNW at 5 to 10 mph..Mostly clear. Low 19F. Winds light and variable. Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 12:53 pmCHICAGO (AP) — These days, it's faster and cheaper than ever to decipher a person's entire DNA. But a small study suggests that looking for disease risks that way may not be ready for the masses.For one thing, the research found that gene variants most likely linked with significant disease were the least likely to be accurately identified.And analyzing the mass of data from the DNA scan is a daunting task, researchers said.Some experts think more targeted gene-mapping is a better approach. But while whole genome sequencing is mostly done for research, it has far-reaching potential for diagnosing and treating genetic diseases, even in people with no known risks. The new results show its promise and its challenges.Stanford University researchers performed whole genome sequencing in 12 healthy people. Most of the millions of genetic variants they found were of uncertain significance, although one woman was found to have a high genetic risk for cancer.DNA is recovered by a simple blood test and deciphered by machines. The difficulty lies in interpreting the findings and figuring out which variants are important and which ones can be ignored. That takes days of sophisticated follow-up lab tests and interpretation to reveal potentially meaningful genetic information, the researchers said.Dr. Euan Ashley, a senior co-author and Stanford associate professor of medicine and genetics, likened the technology to ""an unruly teenager who has grown up very fast. There's huge potential.""""This paper is like parental tough love — we have to be really honest about where we are in order to bring it up to clinical standards,"" he said.For the test, they used two commercially available instruments to sequence the DNA — the second one to validate the initial findings. But less than one-third of variants in inherited disease genes were confirmed.Several specialists including medical geneticists, genetic counselors and a pathologist examined the findings and recommended follow-up tests. Medical intervention was considered appropriate for one participant, a woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer found to have a genetic variant strongly linked with those diseases. That finding led to surgery to remove her ovaries and increased breast cancer screening.The cost per patient was about $17,000 plus hundreds of dollars in follow-up tests. Some centers charge less and the cost is expected to drop considerably as the technique is improved.The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Ashley and several co-authors have financial ties to a genome interpretation company and receive royalties for patents related to genome sequencing. One of the authors has received speaker fees from the maker of one of the machines used.The research and previous studies ""provide a glimpse of what is possible"" for technology that eventually will be widely used for patients, a JAMA editorial said.""Like the personal computer, Internet, smartphones, and electronic health records, turning back now from the use of genomic technologies in health care is inconceivable,"" wrote contributing JAMA editor Dr. William Gregory Feero, former special adviser to the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute.___

368	"Tests are promising but not yet reliable enough, experts sayBy Amy Norton
HealthDay Reporter
TUESDAY, March 11, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Commercially available tests can analyze your genetic profile and try to predict your risk of a host of diseases. But a new study suggests they aren't ready for prime time.The technology, known as whole-genome sequencing, allows scientists to ""map"" the information encoded in most of the billions of building blocks that make up a person's DNA.So far, whole-genome sequencing has been used mainly in research. But the hope is that the technology will help fuel a new era of ""personalized medicine"" -- where doctors will be able to identify patients with gene variants that raise their risk of certain diseases.In the past few years, the cost of whole-genome sequencing has fallen to the point where it could soon be feasible to use it in everyday health care, said Dr. Frederick Dewey, of Stanford University, the lead researcher on the new study.But based on his team's findings, Dewey said, a lot more work is needed before that idea becomes reality.The study, reported in the March 12 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that sequencing a whole genome remains a fairly daunting task.And although the commercially available tests are good, they aren't yet reliable enough for routine patient care, Dewey said.For the study, Dewey's team recruited 12 healthy adults who volunteered a blood sample for whole-genome sequencing.Overall, testing showed that each patient had between 2 million and 3 million unique variations in their DNA. The researchers then used a software program they had developed to whittle down that sea of information to around 100 genetic variations per person that were deemed worthy of more investigation.Next, they analyzed those variations in an old-fashioned way -- by ""actually sitting down,"" Dewey said, and sifting through the medical literature and available genetic databases to see which gene variants might be relevant to people's health.That process took about an hour per variant, at an estimated cost of $17,000 per patient when all was said and done.And what came from the effort? The researchers ended up with about two to six DNA variations for each person that they considered potentially important.In the end, only one study participant had a test result that needed clear action -- but it was a big discovery. The woman carried a mutation in the BRCA1 gene, which carries a high risk of breast and ovarian cancers. She ultimately chose to have her ovaries removed and start more intensive breast cancer screening.""The promise of this [technology] is great, and our study highlights some of the opportunities,"" Dewey said. ""You can identify clinically meaningful disease risks.""But, he added, the study also pinpoints the limitations and challenges of whole-genome sequencing as it stands now.""We have to be honest about what we can reasonably expect this technology to do,"" Dewey said.In particular, his team found that two commercially available whole-genome tests are not yet accurate enough to rely on for routine use. The tests were not able to reliably detect all variations in 7 percent to 16 percent of 56 genes that are known to be associated with disease risks.""There's still a gap between where we are and what would be clinically acceptable,"" Dewey said.Even if the sequencing technology were perfect, that would still leave the question of what to do with all the genetic information, said Dr. William Feero, of Maine Dartmouth Family Medicine Residency, in Augusta.""Trying to determine what's meaningful is quite challenging,"" said Feero, who wrote an editorial published with the study.Much of what's known about the genetic underpinnings of disease is confined to what's called the ""exome"" -- the genes that make the proteins that run your body. But the exome accounts for only about 1 percent of the entire genome. The vast sea of genetic material beyond that was once thought of as ""junk DNA,"" Feero said.Scientists have known for a while that's not true -- that DNA has a number of important jobs, including regulating the protein-making genes of the exome. But Feero and Dewey both said much more remains to be learned about DNA variations and disease risk.Even when there is strong evidence linking a gene variant to health consequences, it might not be clear what to do about it. With the BRCA1 mutation, the risks are clear and women have options for reducing those risks, Feero said.""For a lot of [DNA] variations, there's little information on what to do about it,"" he said.One of the fears about widespread genetic testing is that doctors will be spurred to order a lot of expensive, possibly unnecessary follow-up tests or treatments. In another part of their study, Dewey and his colleagues gave the study participants' results to five doctors to see what they would recommend as a follow-up.Overall, they recommended one to three tests or referrals for each participant, at a cost of about $350 to $800. ""That's reassuring, to some degree,"" Dewey said, since his team actually expected a much higher price tag.The caveat is that the results are based on five doctors -- two of whom were medical geneticists. No one knows, Feero said, what the average doctor in the real world would do.Still, both he and Dewey said whole-genome sequencing holds great promise. Feero predicted that it will at first be used in limited circumstances -- such as helping to diagnose a patient with a chronic condition that is eluding traditional diagnostic methods.Meanwhile, prices continue to fall. Biotech firm Illumina, for example, advertises its current genome-sequencing services at anywhere from $5,000 to $17,500, depending on the specifics. But in January, the company unveiled a new technology it says will bring the cost of sequencing a whole genome to around $1,000.SOURCES: Frederick Dewey, M.D., Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, Stanford, Calif.; William Gregory Feero, M.D., Ph.D., Maine Dartmouth Family Medicine Residency, Augusta, Maine; March 12, 2014, Journal of the American Medical AssociationPaginationSome of these might surprise you.Symptoms of binge eating disorder.14 tips to ditch the itch.Get your personalized plan.© 2005 - 2018 WebMD LLC.

369	"By Andrew M. SeamanNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Before doctors use technology to evaluate every ""letter"" in a person's DNA to detect or diagnose medical conditions, several hurdles must be overcome, according to a new study.Researchers found that sequencing a person's whole genome - all three billion or so DNA nucleotides in the chromosomes - required a significant amount of manpower for a small payoff.They also found that identifications of potentially significant variations were not always reliable and doctors disagreed on how to proceed.One of the study's authors said the cost of sequencing a person's entire genome has dropped in recent years, but the technology has been mostly used for research.""We thought the time had come to do a small pilot study of patients in the clinical setting,"" Dr. Euan Ashley told Reuters Health.Ashley is a specialist in genomics and medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine in California.For the new study published in JAMA, he and his colleagues recruited 12 unrelated people between November 2011 and March 2012 to have their full genomes sequenced.The goal was to see how whole-genome sequencing may work in a real-world setting, such as a hospital or doctor's office.After drawing blood from the participants, the researchers sent all twelve samples to be sequenced by one large company and nine of the samples were also sent to a second sequencing company to see how comparable the sequence results would be.The two sets of sequences mostly agreed when it came to common genetic variants (versions) of genes, but there were greater differences in the results among less common variants. For about 10 percent to 19 percent of genes that may be related to inherited diseases, the sequences were not reliable enough to ensure accuracy.The researchers also used a computer program to sift the participants' genetic data to identify the mutations that should be examined more closely - about 100 per participant.It took researchers about one hour to research each mutation, which ended up costing about $15,000 per patient in manpower.Experts who examined the data also disagreed on the significance of some of the specific variants examined.Overall, a handful of genetic variants for each patient were reported to a group of primary care doctors, who then made recommendations about whether the patient should receive additional tests or be referred to specialists.The doctors recommended between one and three referrals or medical tests per patient based on the results. The cost for that testing ranged from about $350 to $800.""The use of whole genome sequencing was associated with incomplete coverage of inherited disease genes, low reproducibility of genetic variation with the highest potential clinical effects, and uncertainty about clinically reportable whole genome sequencing findings,"" the researchers write.However, they note that one participant did find out about a gene variant that put her at an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. That led her to have surgery and increased cancer screenings.""This paper should essentially give people pause and make them think about some of the hard work that is yet to be done,"" Dr. W. Gregory Feero told Reuters Health.Feero, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, is a contributing editor to JAMA and on the faculty of the Maine Dartmouth Family Medicine Residency in Fairfield, Maine.""I think right now there are very few places that would be contemplating using this tool on patients clinically,"" he said.""While there is great opportunity from the standpoint of medicine for this technology, we have to remain cautious,"" Ashley said.But Feero said that whole-genome sequencing is not too far off.""I think at the pace things are moving right now, this will be employed clinically faster than many people would have thought even five years ago,"" he said.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1fq8CJk and http://bit.ly/1fq8GZq JAMA, online March 11, 2014."

370	"STANFORD, Calif. — Whole-genome sequencing has been touted as a game-changer in personalized medicine. Clinicians can identify increases in disease risk for specific patients, as well as their responsiveness to certain drugs, by determining the sequence of the billions of building blocks, called nucleotides, that make up their DNA.Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered that although life-changing discoveries can be made, significant challenges must be overcome before whole-genome sequencing can be routinely clinically useful. In particular, they found that individual risk determination would benefit from a degree of improved sequencing accuracy in disease-associated genes. Furthermore, up to 100 hours of manual assessment by professional genetic counselors or informatics specialists is required for detailed genome analysis.Although the technique was once prohibitively expensive, plummeting costs have been widely expected to rapidly usher whole-genome sequencing into the arena of mainstream health care. However, the researchers' findings indicate that clinical advances from whole-genome sequencing are, at least in the near future, likely to be significantly more expensive and labor-intensive than some patients and clinicians may have been led to believe.""We need to be very honest about what we can and cannot do at this point in time,"" said Euan Ashley, MD, associate professor of medicine and of genetics, one of three senior authors of the paper. ""It's clear that if we sequence enough cases, we can change someone's life. But with this opportunity comes the responsibility to do this right. Our hope is that the identification of specific hurdles will allow researchers in this field to focus their efforts on overcoming them to make this technique clinically useful.""The paper will be published March 12 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Michael Snyder, PhD, professor and chair of genetics, and Thomas Quertermous, MD, professor of medicine, also share senior authorship of the paper. Postdoctoral scholar and cardiology fellow Frederick Dewey, MD, genetic counselor Megan Grove, CGC, and postdoctoral scholar Cuiping Pan, PhD, share lead authorship of the paper.The researchers analyzed the whole genomes of 12 healthy people and took note of the degree of sequencing accuracy necessary to make clinical decisions in individuals, the time it took to manually analyze each person's results and the projected costs of recommended follow-up medical tests.""This has been an important project for the Stanford team for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it represents the initial genetics effort to make use of the Stanford GenePool Biobank,"" said Quertermous, the William G. Irwin Professor in Cardiovascular Medicine. GenePool was recently launched to promote genomic research in a clinical setting and to improve patient care; the 12 people in the study were the first participants in the effort.""GenePool gives Stanford patients the opportunity to participate in ground-breaking research and is a great opportunity for collaboration among Stanford translational researchers,"" Quertermous said.The researchers estimated a cost of about $17,000 per person to sequence the genome and interpret and analyze the average of nearly 100 genetic variations deemed important enough for follow-up in each person. Each variation required approximately one hour of investigation to assess the relevant scientific literature and determine whether the change was indeed likely to modify disease risk in the individual. After this process, the researchers were left with approximately two to six results they felt could be clinically important; doctors who reviewed the results as part of the study suggested follow-up tests that carried costs of less than $1,000 per person.In one of the 12 cases, however, the payoff of this intensive process was big: A woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer learned she carried a potentially deadly deletion in her BRCA1 gene. After confirmation of the finding in a clinical cancer genetics setting, she was able to take action to reduce her future risk for breast and ovarian cancer.""Although there are clearly challenges in bringing whole-genome sequencing into the clinic, this finding was clearly medically significant,"" Dewey said. ""It's not possible to predict from a study of 12 people how often this type of clinically actionable discovery will occur, but it definitely supports the use of this technology.""One significant challenge is the need to decisively determine the sequence of genes already known to be associated with disease. Dewey and his colleagues found that commercially available whole-genome sequencing does not achieve the accuracy necessary to identify every nucleotide in about 7 to 16 percent of genes known to be associated with increased disease risk. While a degree of uncertainty is allowable during studies of populations, which look for trends by comparing hundreds of genomes, it makes it impossible to make accurate predictions about one individual's health status.""These off-the-shelf genome sequencing techniques were developed to provide generally good coverage of most of the genome,"" Dewey said. ""But there are some regions that remain to be covered well that we care very deeply about. We still need to supplement this information with additional sequencing in some regions to make clinically usable decisions.""The study may affect a recent recommendation by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics that so-called ""incidental findings,"" a term used to describe the discovery of potentially disease-associated variations identified during sequencing conducted for an unrelated medical reason, be routinely reported to an individual. Uncertainties or inaccuracies in the sequences of the 56 genes identified by the college could either give the appearance that a dangerous variation is normal, or cause unnecessary alarm and follow-up tests if a gene is mistakenly deemed to have a dangerous mutation.In particular, the two sequencing technologies used in the study — one from San Diego-based Illumina Inc. and one from Mountain View-based Complete Genomics Inc. — had difficulty in reliably identifying regions of the genome with small insertions or deletions of nucleotides. These types of changes are particularly important because they can cause the abrupt termination of a protein coding sequence within the DNA.""It's ironic, and slightly sobering, that we struggle the most in identifying insertions and deletions — those changes in the genome that are most impactful,"" Ashley said.Once the sequences have been determined, it's necessary to figure out which changes, or variants, are likely to be important. Dewey and his colleagues found that the amount of manual labor involved in sifting through the many variants in each individual approached 100 hours. That's because, with the exception of a few well-known mutations, there is no standard way to assess the potential health impact of each change. In the study, three genetic counselors, three clinicians specializing in informatics and one medical pathologist examined each variant and assessed the relevant medical literature (including publications on animal and human studies, as well as genetic databases) to determine potential disease risk.These challenges are particularly striking in the absence of a specific diagnostic question. ""It remains significantly harder to use whole-genome sequencing for disease prediction than for disease diagnosis,"" said Dewey.Variants expected to have potential health consequences were then shared with three primary care physicians and two medical geneticists, who independently studied the results and recommended possible follow-up tests for each person. In general, the projected costs for the tests were less than the researchers predicted  — ranging from $351 to $776.""Some experts in this field feel that this type of testing causes more harm than good, and may lead to very expensive follow-up tests,"" said Snyder, who is the Stanford W. Ascherman, MD, FACS, Professor in Genetics. ""So it was interesting that costs were projected to be relatively modest.""Although some of the findings of the study are somewhat sobering, the authors are confident that the field of whole-genome sequencing is worth pursuing. Sequencing technology is evolving, and the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Clinical Genome Resource, or ClinGen, is meant to help speed the identification of clinically important variants and reduce the burden of manual investigation. Stanford professor of genetics Carlos Bustamante, PhD, is a co-principal investigator on a ClinGen project to improve predictions of disease-associated variants in a variety of populations.""Our intention in doing this analysis was to draw a line describing where we are with this technology at this point in time and identify how best to move forward,"" Ashley said. ""Things are becoming more clear, and the challenges to bringing this technique to the clinic are becoming crystallized. Whole-genome sequencing has the power to be absolutely transformative in the clinic.""Source: Stanford University Medical CenterWe allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect anonymous information.

General Surgery News ReportGuidelines Extend Thrombectomy Window to 24 HoursDoc-to-Doc: Bringing 'Medicine The Musical' to the New York StageFor best viewing, click the bottom right corner for full screen.Despite ""huge"" potential to identify hidden disease risks, whole-genome sequencing is not ready for its close-up.That's the bottom line of a small study that looked at the reliability, accuracy, and medical utility of sequencing all of the DNA of 12 volunteers, according to Thomas Quertermous, MD, of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute in Stanford, Calif., and colleagues.""Sequencing the whole human genome teaches us a lot, but we're not really ready to do this in prime time with large numbers of humans,"" Quertermous told MedPage Today.But, he added, none of the problems he and his colleagues reported in the March 12 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association are ""insurmountable  --  we will eventually get there.""Experts outside the study team told MedPage Today that Quertermous is correct that the technology is not ready for widespread use but has enormous promise if problems can be fixed.""The potential is great; the challenge, however, is getting it right,"" said Ronald Crystal, MD, of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.Technical issues are likely to be solved soon, he told MedPage Today, but there are gaps in medical knowledge  --  especially about the genetics of complex diseases  --  that have to be filled.""It's going to take several years before that gets sorted out,"" Crystal said.Indeed, the study offers ""a glimpse of what is possible but demonstrate(s) that much remains to be learned,"" commented William Gregory Feero, MD, PhD, of the Maine Dartmouth Family Medicine Residency in Fairfield, Me.In an accompanying editorial, Feero argued that early adopters of the technology run the risk of being snowed under by data that can't be easily used in making clinical decisions.The question, he wrote, is whether data from whole-genome sequencing  --  until problems are ironed out  --  ""will decrease uncertainty and improve outcomes or merely exponentially increase the complexity of clinical care.""For years, researchers have used genome-wide association studies, as well as local sequencing of regions of interest, to try to pin down genes associated with disease.Now that many such genes are known, there is increasing interest in using genetics to individualize medicine, either by sequencing just the exome (the DNA that codes for proteins) or the whole genome.Whole-exome sequencing is cheaper, but Quertermous and colleagues noted that the cost of a whole-genome sequence is approaching $1,000 and both whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing are ""increasingly used in clinical medicine.""Whole-genome sequencing is expected in most cases to uncover variation that has clinical significance, regardless of why the sequencing was ordered in the first place, the researchers noted.For that reason, it's important to know how reliable, accurate, and useful such data is, they argued.To help find out, they enrolled 12 people  --  five men and seven women  --  and sequenced their whole genome, using two different commercial technologies. Genetics professionals interpreted the results using available gene data banks, and medical doctors proposed follow-up based on the genetic findings.But, Quertermous and colleagues reported, there were problems:  Results from the two sequencing approaches did not completely agree. Some regions of the genome  --  including some with known variants associated with disease risk  --  were not well covered. The genetics professionals were not in complete agreement on how to interpret the results, and the medical professionals did not always agree on what to do with them. Genetics databases were incomplete; for each participant about 100,000 previously unidentified variants were found. For each participant, the investigators reported, the sequencing turned up from two to six personal disease-risk findings, and physician review of the findings led to consideration of a median of one to three initial diagnostic tests and referrals per volunteer.One of the disease-risk variants  --  a frameshift deletion in the BRCA1 gene implicated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer  --  was ""very likely pathogenic,"" the researchers reported.The participant involved did not have a family history that would have warranted referral for testing, but after the finding was confirmed by a separate test, she had prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and intensified imaging-based breast cancer screening, the researchers reported.As well as finding disease risks, whole-genome sequencing is expected to uncover genetic variations that might affect drug choice or dosing. In this study, Quertermous and colleagues reported, 11 participants had such genetic variants.Genetic databases ""clearly need to be improved,"" Quertermous told MedPage Today, because they are incomplete as they stand.""For each human that we sequenced,"" he said, ""there were approximately 100,000 new variants that had never been identified before.""""That's an amazing amount of data,"" he added.The technical issues of reliability and reproducibility are probably not going to take long to fix, Crystal commented, but such unidentified variants won't be found in the databases, making interpretation difficult for clinicians.""For many of the genetic variants in the human genome, there just is not sufficient medical knowledge,"" he said.The study was supported by the NIH, the Breetwor Family Foundation, and the LeDucq Foundation. The journal said Quertermous reported a relevant relationship with Aviir, while the co-senior author, Euan A. Ashley, MRCP, DPhil, also of Stanford, reported a relevant relationship with Personalis, a privately held genome interpretation company, and receives royalties for patented technology related to genome sequencing.The journal said Feero reported no relevant relationships.last updated 03.12.2014The material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider.© 2018 MedPage Today, LLC.

374	"   The Senate Health Policy Committee unanimously approved a medical marijuana bill Tuesday that takes a bolder path to legalization than its House companion.As they did for the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee meetings, parents of severely epileptic children told stories of exhausting all traditional treatment and having nowhere to turn. Members of the Senate panel were visibly moved.""No one can sit here and listen to this with a dry eye,"" said Aaron Bean, R-Jacksonville, bill co-sponsor and chairman of the Health Policy Committee.Instead of merely providing a defense for Dravet Syndrome families arrested for possession of CBD medical marijuana, as HB 843 does, Senate Bill 1030 talks about legalization for patients listed in a statewide ""compassionate use"" registry.Only physicians could decide whose names go into the registry; and the physicians would include only the names of individuals who have been ""cleared"" for ""low-THC"" treatment.Doctors would have to keep careful records of how effective the treatment is because the bill requires them to submit detailed quarterly reports to the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. SB 1030 provides $1 million for the college to conduct research on the reports.The Senate bill would also allow patients to ingest the medicine by vapor, a form of intake not mentioned in the House bill.Finally, the plant extract, limited to no more than 0.5 percent THC (the euphoric component) and at least 15 percent CBD (the beneficial component), would be available from up to four dispensaries statewide.The House bill, HB 843, stipulates that strains of marijuana with 0.8 percent or less of the psychoactive component in marijuana, and more than 10 percent of the plant's CBD strain will be legal -- as will its seeds.Still, bill co-sponsor Rob Bradley, R-Orange Park, a former prosecutor and chairman of Senate Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations,said he feels strongly that ""any law that would define (families dealing with such suffering) as criminals defies common sense and is a law that should be changed.""The Senate always was expected to be the friendlier chamber to a medical marijuana bill.For House sponsor Matt Gaetz, R-Shalimar and his prime co-sponsor Katie Edwards, D-Plantation, it has been a long, hard slog to change hearts and minds. As Rep. Dane Eagle, R-Cape Coral, said, ""I was adamant against 843 when we started ... until I saw and talked with some of these parents. My gosh, I don't know how anyone could cope with as much as they have.""Many details still have to be worked out, especially on the House side, but all lawmakers spearheading the medical marijuana bills say they are driven by the high purpose and genuine good that can come from this legislation.Meanwhile, a CNN special, ""Weed 2: Cannabis Madness: Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports,"" aired Tuesday night. It featured the stories of many families with severely epileptic children, some from Florida.Gupta told the story of the Bundukamaras, Franncis, a teacher in Miami-Dade public schools, and Cristi, a nurse practitioner and professor at Miami Dade College. They decided to move their family to Colorado, where they could get the Charlotte's Web marijuana strain their 14-year-old son Reggie needed.""You basically have two choices -- you try to do it illegally, or you uproot your family, so that's what we did,"" Cristi tells Gupta. ""This was our only hope. We almost lost Reggie a couple of times in the last two years. ...""Reggie was experiencing 25 to 100 grand mal seizures a month when the family arrived in Colorado. On a bad day, he would have hundreds of smaller seizures.Now on a course of Charlotte's Web, Reggie's medications have been drastically reduced. Last month, he was down to 13 grand mal seizures, and he's eating and communicating again.Cristi says on camera she's no longer sure she would go home even if Florida passed medical marijuana laws.""It was so hard to uproot and leave, and we're just getting settled,"" she says. ""But it still feels like home. Florida still feels like home.""CNN is likely to repeat the special.Reach Nancy Smith at nsmith@sunshinestatenews.com or at 228-282-2423.Comments are now closed.View MoreYour browser does not support HTML5 audio.

376	"March 12, 2014Lawmakers in both chambers are advancing proposals that would open the door for a non-euphoric strain of marijuana that backers believe can dramatically reduce seizures in children with a rare form of epilepsy.But the two proposals take very different approaches toward making the strain of cannabis known as “Charlotte’s Web” available to about 125,000 children in Florida who might benefit from the compound. The Senate plan, passed for the first time in a committee on Tuesday, would legalize the substance. In contrast, the House proposal would not decriminalize the product but would provide individuals arrested, investigated or charged with a crime an “affirmative defense” that they could use to prove their innocence in court.Both proposals deal with Charlotte’s Web, a strain of marijuana low in tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component in marijuana, but high in the derivative cannabidiol, or CBD.The Senate measure (SB 1030), unanimously approved by the Senate Health Policy Committee on Tuesday, would create a statewide “compassionate use” registry of individuals deemed by their physicians to be eligible for “low-THC” treatment. The Senate plan would also allow users to ingest the substance by vapor, something not expressly permitted in the House version. And it would allow up to four dispensaries to distribute the substance, which could contain no more than .5 percent of THC and at least 15 percent CBD.Doctors could write the prescriptions for people who suffer from seizure disorders and who do not respond to other treatments, and keep records of how effective the treatment is. Doctors would have to submit quarterly reports about the efficacy of the treatment to the University of Florida College of Pharmacy, which would conduct research on the reports. The Senate plan would set aside $1 million to cover the research.Under the House plan (HB 843), people who have strains of marijuana that contain .8 percent or less of THC and more than 10 percent of CBDs, along with the seeds of the plant, would have an “affirmative defense” available to them if they are caught with the substance or charged with a crime. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, the bill’s sponsor, said he hopes that law-enforcement officials and prosecutors won’t go after families, growers or doctors involved with Charlotte’s Web. The House version also allows for higher concentrations of THC and lower concentrations of CBD, which supporters say would treat more types of neurological diseases than the Senate’s more restrictive levels.As in previous hearings on the hybrid, the Senate panel heard from parents who believe their children would benefit from the treatment — and fear they could die without it.Peyton and Holley Moseley’s 11-year-old adopted daughter RayAnn is one of about 125,000 Florida children diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy that can cause hundreds of seizures a day and does not respond to other treatments. The couple traveled to Colorado, where Charlotte’s Web is manufactured, and met with the child for whom the hybrid is named, who can now walk and talk.“And that’s why I’m here today, to ask for that opportunity for RayAnn and other children in Florida,” Holley Moseley said.One of the bill’s sponsors, Senate Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley, a former prosecutor, said that lawmakers need to do something to help the “wonderful, inspirational parents” who are looking to the Legislature for help.“Any law that would define them as criminals defies common sense and is a law that should be changed,” Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said.GOP leaders in both the House and the Senate support the concept of making the non-euphoric pot available to parents whose children are wracked with hundreds of seizures a day and which can be fatal.And many Republican lawmakers are galvanizing support around Charlotte’s Web — which doesn’t get users high and isn’t smoked — as a more acceptable alternative to the medical marijuana question that will go before voters in November. The proposed constitutional amendment — bankrolled by Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, who is also Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist’s boss — would let doctors write prescriptions for severely ill patients. Republicans insist the amendment gives doctors too much discretion over who is eligible for the pot treatment and, if passed, would result in “pot shops on every corner.”Some GOP holdouts are reluctant to legalize any form of pot for personal and political reasons. Some fear that voters will interpret authorization of Charlotte’s Web as tacit approval of traditional medical marijuana. Others are concerned that the House proposal lacks the details necessary to ensure that the product delivered to patients is controlled and regulated.“I’m still cautiously optimistic that we can thread the needle so that we can help these families in some way and yet not abandon our whole understanding of drug safety and dosage and testing. It has its troubles. But it does protect consumers. We need to handle it very cautiously,” said House Judiciary Chairman Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala.by Dara Kim, The News Service of Florida5 Responses to “Competing Medical Marijuana Proposals In House, Senate”why is it the government business if someone wants to smoke pot.  why would any tax payer want to pay $50,000 dollars a year to lock up  someone simply for smoking pot. I have enough problems paying for my own heath care I don’t want to pay for there’s . what happened to freedom. some people jest cant mind there own business. if pot destroys lives what do they think taking someone away from their family does. why cant you do your thing and I do my thing to.Maybe it is best to leave things just as they are.This is not the best system, but the trains do run pretty much on time.Why risk it? We all know it will be used and abused in a matter of time.  This is a BAD idea!!I agrre with you. They should sell non alcoholic beer and go back to prohibition. This is how stupid the governmental laws are. It is ok to put chemicals in your body provided by the drug companies(ONLY CARE ABOUT STOCKHOLDERS!!!), than provide a natural substance that is free to grow. Another thing, to think about is why alcohol and nicotine is ok, but marijuana is still such a forbiden subject???? Corporations and greedy politicians.To be fair lets pass a law to only sell non alcoholic beer, and liquor!Name (required)

382	"Discussions around medical marijuana legalization appear to be becoming a national trend and Louisiana is no different.Watch reportDuring this year’s legislative session, lawmaker in Baton Rouge will take up legislation, which could legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes.Rep. Austin Badon (D-La.) co-authored a bill that would legalize medical marijuana.Badon says because cannabis can come in different forms such as oil or flakes, the drug could help people dealing with different ailments.Badon said lawmakers must hash out how the drug will be processed, its chemical compound and where patients could purchase it.""We can really control the medical marijuana. And I think that if we can do anything to help control epileptic seizures, cancer, or any type of those maladies that certain physicians say medical marijuana helps them, I think we should explore that,” Badon said.Badon said he hasn’t made up his mind about potential legislation that would support recreational use.On a similar note, Badon authored a House Bill 14. That bill would reduce the criminal penalties for simple marijuana possession.Colorado raked in about $2 million from taxes on recreational marijuana in January, the first month it was legal to sell non-medicinal pot in the state.On Jan. 1, Colorado became the first state to permit the sale of recreational marijuana to anyone age 21 or older.Related:Jindal's priorities for legislative session: Job training, legal system, human traffickingColorado gets $2 million from marijuana taxesMedical pot refugees: 'Our only hope'State-by-state look at marijuana laws25 facts about marijuanaSign up for our email newsletters to get breaking news right in your inbox. Click here to sign up!Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on purchases made through our links to retailer sites."

Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 11:53 amAccording to KMOV.com, A bill to legalize recreational marijuana in Missouri is now being considered by a state House panel.The bill, sponsored by Rep. Chris Kelly, D-Columbia, would allow anyone over the age of 21 to use, grow and sell marijuana legally. It would also impose a 25 percent tax on pot, as well as set up a system of state licensing for growers and sellers.Under the system, each county would be allowed to have one retailer for every 2,500 people. If passed, St. Louis County could have 400 retailers, while 127 would be allowed in the city.The bill would also allow pot users without a license to keep and transport a pound of marijuana, a pound of hashish and more than a half-gallon of hashish oil.Information from KMOV.com contributed to this report.While I certainly don't support the trends in America, the closing of churches and schools throughout the nation, the proliferation of gun usage, and now the legalization of  drugs, I see one good thing possibly resulting from the legalization of marijuana.  While poor blacks certainly have no means of transporting drugs across the waters to gain entry into the US where it eventually is sold on the streets in America, it has been the blacks who have been convicted and remain incarcerated by the thousands.  Once these drugs are legalized, we will be able to ""compare"" sales to determine where the greatest volumes are.  It will be even more interesting to compare the zip codes of the incarcerated to the zip codes where the sales volumes are greatest.Some may attempt to justify what may appear to be greater sales volumes in a more affluent area, that the high volumes are attributable to greater medical demands in that area.  If that is the case, will such high demand in any particular zip code increase the costs for medical insurance, auto insurance, or property insurance?  Will the usage of this drug impact an employers decision to hire a particular individual?  How will its use impact when one is arrested for a DUI?  Will the courts have to determine what an percentage that is acceptable in one's blood level similar to that of alcohol?  Will its usage lessen one's inhibitions and contribute to more gun usage or incidents of violence?  Child abuse?  Who knows?I contend, however, that both churches and schools served us well and that we should be very careful of what we wish for.grinders can be made of wood, metal, and acrylic. marijuana helps people sleep better. there are certainly one compartment grinders, two compartment grinder, three compartment grinder, and also the rare four compartment grinders. marijuana could be smoked, inhailed, eaten, and vaporized. do you've always wondered getting fantastic marijuana for a joint? the space case grinder is a great grinder for medical marijuana patients. good herb grinders have kief collectors that enables you to collect kief and save it for later. you don't need to be rich to buy an excellent grinder, you can buy a powerful one for $20. marijuana grinders are good for ending it weed if you want an even smoke. kief is a highly prized item for smoking because it is so concentrated. bestgrinder.net is a superb website that you should find a very good herb grinder. many individuals discover the space case grinder's design to suite well because of their needs. marijuana can be used recreationally along with medically. acrylic grinders are harmful and ought to be avoided. wood grinders are ok but metal grinders are the best. vaporizers require high quality bud and a grinder is a superb way for you to breakup perhaps the toughest bud without getting the hands dirty. good bud ought to be ground-up properly for a much smoke. marijuana help patients handle pain and discomforts.best marijuana grinder allows you to breakup your marijuana without much work.http://bestgrinder.net

384	"A bill to decriminalize marijuana hit a snag Tuesday in the state Senate. An effort to kill the legislation failed, but significant changes are being made in an effort to gain support.Mobile users tap here to watch videoThis bill is expected to pass in the Senate as changes are being made to push it through the House.Lawmakers are seeking middle ground in a strategy to grow support for making possessing small amounts of marijuana a civil rather than a criminal offense.The Senate is rolling in amendments to change the paradigm in Maryland, pushing it as a health issue. Instead of a $100 civil citation, third-time offenders would have to go before a judge.""Then, a judge may order drug treatment. What was missing for this piece of legislation was how do you make this more of a public health issue versus one for criminal courts?"" said Sen. Christopher Shank, R-Washington County.The American Civil Liberties Union supports the bill. A study the ACLU commissioned finds that Maryland has one of the highest arrest rates for marijuana in the country, and although blacks and whites use of marijuana is comparable, blacks are locked up more often than anyone. The ACLU believes making this a health issue may reduce teen use.""We've been able to reduce teen use of alcohol and tobacco without arresting anybody, so we really shouldn't be arresting anybody for marijuana,"" said Sarah Love, public policy director of the ACLU.This latest version of the bill gets tougher on juveniles. Those under 18 would face a judge rather than a civil citation.""Like underage alcohol, they have to go to court and see a judge and be ordered into a drug treatment or an education program,"" said Sen. Bobby Zirkin, D-Baltimore County.Although some in the Senate flat out oppose the measure, it's expected to pass as it did last year. The changes are being made in the hope to find more acceptance in the House.Last year, the bill didn't even get a vote in the House Judiciary Committee, whose chairman, Joe Vallario, cited concern over what people will act like once it's fully legal.""The problem is that we don't want to have people smoking pot on the streets. There's some concern and that's why we are looking forward to hearing what the testimony is. They are on parole and they're smoking pot because it's only a civil fine,"" Vallario said.Vallario will get his chance Thursday, when a similar bill comes before his committee.Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on purchases made through our links to retailer sites."

386	"LANSING, MI -- It wasn't the cancer. It was the weight loss that finally led Montrose Mayor Ray Foust to seek out medical marijuana for his dying niece.Roughly five years ago, Foust drove her 80 miles to a clinic in Southfield, where doctors ran her through a series of tests, certified her for medical marijuana use and gave her five cannabis capsules to try on her way out.His niece, who had lost her appetite due to chemotherapy, popped one of the pills and saw immediate results. ""Let's pull into Wendy's,"" she told her uncle on the drive home. ""I'm hungry.""Foust, testifying before the Michigan Senate Government Operations Committee on Tuesday, offered support for bills that would allow for the return of medical marijuana dispensaries and edible marijuana products in the wake of state court rulings that limited the legality of each. The small-town mayor told lawmakers that he registered as a caregiver for his niece under Michigan's voter-approved medical marijuana law but found it too time consuming to grow the drug himself. Instead, he continued driving to Southfield each month, picking up medication for his niece until he and other city council members approved a local dispensary in Montrose. ""I call it a safe transfer center,"" Foust said. ""I don't see why anybody would have to go to some low-life place to get a medicine … We don't want 10 distributors down the line. We don't want to be known as the medical marijuana capital. We want people to be able to get their medicine. That's all.""House Bill 4271, sponsored by state Rep. Mike Callton (R-Nashville), would give local communities the power to allow, prohibit or limit medical marijuana ""provisioning centers."" The regulated dispensaries could not operate within 1,000 feet of a school, could only sell products tested for safety and could not allow use on the premises.A 2013 Michigan Supreme Court ruling allowed county prosecutors to shut down unregulated dispensaries that had popped up around the state. Many businesses simply closed up shop before law enforcement stepped in.House Bill 5104, sponsored by state Rep. Eileen Kowall (R-White Lake), would expand the definition of usable medical marijuana to allow for non-smokable forms of the drug, including edibles, tinctures and topical creams. Many patients would rather not smoke, Kowall said, but a Michigan Court of Appeals ruling essentially limited their options.Both medical marijuana bills passed the House by wide margins in December, but the Senate has been slow to act. Majority Leader Randy Richardville (R-Monroe), who chairs the Senate Government Operations Committee, took testimony on the bills Tuesday but did not hold a vote.The Michigan State Police worked on the edibles bill but opposes it as written because of labeling language and concerns that an officer may not be able to determine how much marijuana is in any given product. MSP also is concerned that dispensaries would have to operate as cash-only businesses because of federal rules, making them potential targets for criminals.Eric Pessle, environmental health division director for the Kent County Health Department, also testified against the dispensary bill, which would also allow provisioning centers to prepare and sell edible products. The legislation would require local inspections, but Pessle said that dispensaries preparing food should be subject to the same state-level requirements as traditional kitchens.The majority of the testimony was supportive, however, with several registered patients describing success with the drug and difficulty obtaining it from a registered caregiver, whose numbers are on the decline.""This is really about dignity,"" said John Targowski, a criminal defense attorney from Kalamazoo who uses medical marijuana to treat symptoms stemming from a severe spinal cord injury. ""Dignity for patients who throughout 2009 and 2010 had legitimate, safe access to marijuana. Our appellate courts in Michigan have narrowly interpreted the Medical Marihuana Act…and that's not what we voted for."" Jonathan Oosting is a Capitol reporter for MLive Media Group.

391	"Mar 11, 2014 09:40 AM EDT | By Staff WriterMedical marijuana is gaining acceptance across the United States. Yet there are still states where cannabis is illegal, such as Ohio. Now, there's a new trend when it comes to seeking out the medical properties of weed. Men and women are moving to Colorado as ""marijuana refugees"" in order to legally use the drug.Colorado legalized marijuana sales as of Jan. 1, according to USA Today. Since then, the substance has wound up in edibles that include everything from brownies to beef jerky. Other states have also followed the trend; Massachusetts recently awarded the first 20 licenses to operate medical marijuana dispensaries, and even southern states are changing their views on marijuana. Yet not all states are following this trend.That's why over the last eight months, more than 100 families have moved to Colorado in order to legally use medical marijuana, according to CNN.com. More specifically, these families have sought out the drug for their children, many of whom suffer from seizures. Fortunately for these children, marijuana seems to be working.There are actually a number of anecdotal reports of positive outcomes from a particular strain of marijuana that's known as Charlotte's Web, according to The Star Tribune. This strain has been known to help children with epilepsy. In fact, one family has managed to reduce the amount of medication their child needs by using the marijuana.

""We've been able to reduce her pharmaceuticals by 50 percent as a result of using Charlotte's Web,"" said Paula Lyles, the child's mother, in an interview with CNN.com. ""It's ridiculous. I didn't want to do it, but now that I'm out here on the other side I know I'm where I'm supposed to be. I wanted to do anything to save Jordan's life.""Needless to say, this case provides strong support for the use of medical marijuana. Yet while some states are legalizing the drug, others are holding out. While it may take time, though, it's possible that we may see a U.S. where pot is legal in the future.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSYou have already subscribed.

Sam Brownback announces mental health crisis center in Kansas City, Kan.  Credit Alex Smith / KCUR    ""Usually more than one time a day,” says Don Ash, sheriff of Wyandotte County, Kan.  “Calls could come in from a family member. Calls could come in from the general public. From a business owner.”Someone might be picked up for something as simple as loitering or trespassing, and even though it might clearly a mental health emergency, police typically have little choice but to take them to jail or possibly an emergency room.But a new facility in the works in Kansas City, Kan., raises hope that local police will soon a better option.Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback announced Jan. 23 that a former state psychiatric hospital near the University Of Kansas Hospital, which has been mostly mothballed during the past few years, is being converted into a mental crisis stabilization facility.A Department of Justice report shows that nearly two-thirds of jail inmates in have some kind of mental health problem. Some have committed real crimes, but many have not.Ash believes taking these people to jail is not a great way to deal with a crisis, and it taps police resources.“They’re not available to be doing what the public truly expects them to be doing, and that is really dealing with suppressing crime or investigating crime,"" Ash said.“It is our hope that this is gonna be one of the most helpful and significant changes in the mental health system and its delivery in this state over the past, even couple of decades,” Brownback said when he announced the facility in Kansas City, Kan.The Rainbow Mental Health Facility in Kansas City, Kan., has been all but empty since being cited for safety violations and staffing concerns in 2011. It will reopen April 1 as the first of the new 24/7 crisis stabilization centers in Kansas. Patients might stay a few hours or a few weeks. The new facility will have 10 longer-stay beds, compare to 50 beds in the previous Rainbow incarnation.Many involved in mental health agree the new facility could make a big difference, but see it just one step forward after years of falling behind on supporting mental illness.""There's been a steady erosion over the past seven, eight years on both sides of the state line,""  Susan Crain Lewis, President and CEO of Mental Health America of the Heartland, says of mental illness funding in the state.""It’s not been a question of ‘let’s get something more’ it’s like ‘how can we hold on to the bare minimum?’”State grants were created in the early 1990s to fund community mental health centers in Kansas. That funding was cut in 2008-09 and has fluctuated since then. The state attributes recent cuts to lower Medicaid caseloads.Missouri has also seen significant cuts for safety net services: about $17 million since 2010.Lewis says those cuts have meant the uninsured and underinsured can’t get the help they need.“The minute you can’t go to your doctor for any amount of time, you get sicker,” says Lewis.         The Rainbow Mental Health Facility in Kansas City, Kan. has been mostly closed since 2011.  Credit Alex Smith / KCUR    Many advocates trace a new interest in funding mental health to the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., when a 20-year-old man who may have had a mental illness killed 26 people.“You always hate that it takes something like that for us to start paying attention to thing we know we need to be doing, but it did - I think - change the concentration on this issues,” says Brent McGinty, President and CEO of the Missouri Coalition of Community Mental Health Centers.McGinty says that in the last year, the Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and legislature have done a lot more for mental health, with programs like the “Strengthening Mental Health” initiative.About a month after the Sandy Hook shooting, Gov. Brownback announced plans for a new Kansas mental health strategy. He said he would channel $10 million into a regional mental health hub system.Brownback's new mental health strategy includes the rehabilitation of the Rainbow Mental Health Facility, and Sheriff Ash says it will make a difference.“I believe we will start to see a reduction in some of these people that we see, or that we see on a regular basis,” Ash explains.Susan Crain Lewis is optimistic, but cautious.“It’s a huge help, but it doesn’t solve all of the problems,” Lewis says.Even though the crisis center will fill an important gap, Lewis believes grant money still needs to be restored for community mental health centers. She says those funds are needed to help continue keeping people well after the work of the crisis center has ended.“The connection’s essential, but how long can that connection hold?” Lewis asks. “And how much can the community mental health center bear with no more revenue for the ongoing needs of those people?”The crisis invention approach may be spreading, however. Advocates are currently seeking funding for a crisis facility on the Missouri side of the state line.Eds note: This version adds clarity to the statement mental health funding levels in Kansas.Gov. Sam Brownback Thurday unveiled his administration’s plan for reopening the Rainbow Mental Health Facility. “I think this is a winner,” Brownback said, referring to a Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services plan for privatizing the state hospital’s operations. The plan calls for converting the former 50-bed inpatient facility to a 10-bed “crisis stabilization resource” designed to connect people with serious and persistent mental illness to community-based services.Gov.

Jay Nixon says Missouri is sorely lacking in mental health services, but he hopes to fix that with more higher education spending.  Speaking Wednesday at UMKC’s School of Nursing, the Governor said his balanced budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2015 included $20 million in grants for schools to train future psychiatrists, psychologist and mental health nurses.  Only 10 of the state’s 114 counties currently have adequate mental health care, according to a federal report. Gov.

397	 Young people suffering from the early stages of psychosis are not getting potentially lifesaving help because of cuts that have left some areas completely bereft of early intervention services.The charity Rethink Mental Illness said that cuts were creating a “lost generation” of young people. The majority of Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services said that their care provision had decreased and that they have cut jobs in the past year. Half of all EIP services in England have faced cuts, some by as much as 20 per cent, the charity said.In a second report outlining the scale of the crisis affecting England’s mental health services, which have been vulnerable to both NHS efficiency savings and cuts to social care spending by local authorities, the charity Mind said today that 30,000 people with mental health problems had lost their social care since 2005. Cuts to local government budgets imposed by the Coalition have led to a £90 million shortfall in mental health social care funding, the charity reported.Meanwhile a lack of bed availability on mental health wards has led to a steep rise in the number of young mental health patients forced to stay on adult wards, official data revealed yesterday. The Health and Social Care Information Centre said that 250 under 18s in England had been cared for on adult wards between April and November 2013 - more than in the whole year 2012/13.We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

398	Patients lives will be put at risk due to controversial NHS funding changes for mental health services that ‘completely contravene’ the government’s commitment to treating mental health on an equal footing to physical health, experts warn.In a letter to the Guardian, six leading mental health organisations say the decision to impose a 20% higher cut in the tariff for NHS mental health and community services than for acute hospitals next year will mean vital support is cut for patients at a time when services are already ‘straining at the seams’.NHS England and health regulator Monitor are imposing a 1.8% cut in tariff prices for community and mental health providers in 2014/15. Acute providers face a reduction of 1.5%. The NHS bodies have justified the differential, first revealed by the Health Service Journal in January, by arguing that acute trusts had to meet the costs of implementing the recommendations from the Francis report into the Mid Staffs hospital scandal.The letter, whose signatories include the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Centre for Mental Health, warns:“Mental health is chronically underfunded.

People with mental health problems could die because of controversial NHS funding changes which breach ministerial pledges to treat patients with psychological or physical conditions equally, patient charities are warning.Six leading mental health organisations say NHS England's decision to cut the amount of money the sector will receive in ""tariffs"" or fees for its services from April will badly hit an area of NHS care that is already ""straining at the seams"".They are angry that NHS bosses and Monitor, the NHS's economic regulator, are imposing a 1.8% cut in the amount of money for non-acute care services, which include mental health. That is higher than the 1.5% reduction in the budget for acute hospital-based medical services.In a letter published in Wednesday's Guardian they warn that the decision ""contravenes the government's promise to put mental and physical healthcare on an equal footing and will put lives at risk"".The co-authors of the letter include the charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Mental Health Network.The differential tariff is being brought in to raise £150m to help acute hospital trusts pay for the extra staffing needed to comply with the recommendations of the Francis report into the Mid Staffs care scandal. NHS England and Monitor argued that non-acute service providers did not need extra money to tackle understaffing because Francis's recommendations did not cover them. However, David Cameron and several ministers have made clear that providers of all types of NHS care should be improving their staffing levels if necessary.Doing so will cost non-acute providers about £150m, the same amount that they are losing in effect to subsidise hospital services, according to an estimate drawn up by the Foundation Trust Network.Norman Lamb, the care services minister, has called the decision to penalise mental health services ""flawed and unacceptable"".Lord Victor Adebowale, chief executive of the addiction and mental health charity Turning Point, has called the decision ""bordering on laughable"". The NHS England board – of which he is a member – never discussed it before it was approved, he said, ""and there are lessons that should be learned"".The co-authors of the letter want NHS England to think again and cut both types of services equally. But while NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson last week acknowledged the criticism of the way the decision was reached, he made clear that it would not be reviewed because acute hospitals needed the money to hire more nurses.We find it hard to think of men as vulnerable, and their psychological suffering is often overlooked, writes Luke SullivanTime to Change hopes its model for raising awareness among primary care staff can be rolled out across the country, writes Mary O'Hara"	Health

The recent decision by NHS England and the health regulator Monitor to recommend cutting funding for mental health services by 20% more than that for acute hospitals completely contravenes the government's promise to put mental and physical healthcare on an equal footing and will put lives at risk.Following Mid Staffs, all NHS services were obliged to comply with the Francis report to improve care and safety for patients. NHS England funded the additional costs of implementing these recommendations, yet it withheld this from mental health services – creating a significant budget shortfall. Not only does this send out a disturbing and deeply disappointing message, it is likely to have far-reaching consequences for people with mental illness.Mental health is chronically underfunded. It accounts for 28% of the disease burden, but gets just 13% of the NHS budget. Mental health services are straining at the seams and these new cuts will mean support is slashed in response to instructions from NHS England. This decision will cost much more in the long term as it will drive up admissions to A&E and the number of people reaching crisis and needing expensive hospital care.Mid Staffs was one of the biggest tragedies the NHS has ever faced.

402	Budget cuts have left tens of thousands of adults with mental health problems without key social care support that could help prevent their health from deteriorating to crisis point, a leading charity has warned.An analysis by Mind found that the number of adults with mental health needs who received social care support has fallen by at least 30,000 since 2005, a drop of 21%. Cuts to local authority social care budgets – the majority of which have hit since 2009 – have left a funding shortfall for care of up to £260 million, the charity said.Mind extracted the data from research published by the London School of Economics in December last year. When demographic changes are accounted for, the fall in the number of mental health service users in receipt of social care support since 2005 could be as high as 68,000 – a 48% drop. The reduction in the number of people with physical health needs receiving social care support was 33%.The report also found that almost a third (30%) of councils had halved the number of people with mental health problems receiving social care support.Paul Farmer, Mind’s chief executive, said the findings suggested the government was failing to “look at the bigger picture” around support for people with mental health needs.“In reality it is cheaper to provide preventative services like social care, which help people affected by mental health problems at an earlier stage, in comparison to crisis services that are currently understaffed and overstretched,” he said.Farmer also urged the government to introduce a ‘more reasonable’ national threshold for social care than the current plans to set it at a level equivalent to the ‘substantial’ band used by the vast majority of local authorities. The powers to set a national threshold for care are included in the government’s Care Bill, which is expected to complete its journey through Parliament shortly.Frontline social workers have also raised concerns over funding for services. More than half (50.5%) of 111 mental health social workers surveyed by The College of Social Work (TCSW) said investment in statutory social work for mental health was ‘poor’ in their area. Over a third (35.3%) rated standards of mental health care as ‘poor’ and almost half (47%) reported problems accessing personal budgets for people with mental health needs.Steve Chamberlain, chair of TCSW’s network of Approved Mental Health Professionals, said the cuts to social care support highlighted by Mind could be “the tip of the iceberg”.“It looks like the next two or three years is likely to see even more cuts to funding for local authorities. Thresholds for social care have already gone up in many areas as there is less money to go around. It feels like we are increasingly unable to intervene earlier and work with people to access social elements that can help to maintain their mental health and avoid crises,” he said.Faye Wilson, chair of the British Association of Social Workers mental health forum, also said that rising thresholds for social care were leading to less preventive work.“If you really want to support someone’s recovery it’s about things like supporting them to integrate into their community, helping them to access employment or benefits, supporting them to get their life back. The support cannot be restricted to just the healthcare part. You take those other social support components away and you’ve got a real problem,” she said.Sarah Norman, co-chair of the Association for the Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) mental health network, said the research had to be viewed in the context of significant reductions to local authority budgets in the past three years and a general drive to reduce dependency on services.“Throughout, social care services have done their utmost to maintain services for people with mental health issues, and to extend as far as possible the principles of personalisation in working with them,” she said.Adass believes that the government’s proposed threshold for care, under the Care Bill, is likely to widen rather than reduce eligibility for social care, Norman added.A Department of Health spokesperson said the government expected NHS and local authorities to ensure “equal priority” is given to mental health and physical health services when making spending decisions.“We have given councils significant extra funding for social care and are going further by creating our £3.8bn Better Care Fund to invest in joined up services that keep people living well and independently for as long as possible. Our national eligibility threshold will be set at a level that will allow local authorities to maintain the same level of access to support for those who are eligible when they move to the new care and support system in April 2015,” she added.As one of those affected by mental illness, I can truthfully attest that cutting back on assistance for those who fight daily to adjust to living in the mailstream will have a dramatic impact on their wellbeing and performance in society. This is not where cuts should be made. The less those of us are assisted, the more people in need will have a negative affect on their contribution to society as a whole. I was lucky enough, after working many years, to be accepted on Social Security Disabiity in May of 2011. I could no longer hold a paying job, even part time. To pay for medications, treatment, and receive basic training to continue in some type of employment, more donations and assistance from the community is essential for our growth and wellbeing. Please fight this battle for funding in your grassroot agencies so that others will not have to suffer because of a diagnosis that they did not incur themselves…I don’t believe that this is a true reflection. Yes we don’t have the money as local authorities. However, I have never met a social worker who has halved the social support provided to people with mental health problems due to funding. Where there is a need its provided for! The government set these agendas, reduce money and then put money into new agendas to fix the problem they created!It is good that you publish items of this nature, and seek to challenge the current lack of parity between Mental Health Care services, and care for people with other sorts of health concerns. The truth is that NO service should EVER face cuts in funding that directly affect the quality of support and treatment that it is able to provide. At the end of the day, care is about patients, and about having the best interests of patients in mind. Cuts to services that leave patients without adequate support clearly do not act in the best interests of patients – it might even be argued that they put patients at risk. Furthermore, cuts that affect one service more than they do others might also be viewed as DISCRIMINATORY.For a long time, Mental Health Services were the “poor sibling” of the rest of the NHS and Social Services – a sort of “Cinderella service”. I suspect that this is a legacy of our society’s long-ingrained negative attitude towards mental illness; the legacy of stigma. Current cuts to funding come on top of this, leaving a huge deficit.Sadly, it is my personal belief (and has been ever since I qualified as a Social Worker) that society just does not really understand Social Work – what it is, what workers do, what role the service fills. I firmly believe that many people in Government, and in the NHS, also have this lack of clarity. It is as though there are some people out there who think we could do away with Social Care altogether! Others seem to think that Social Care is just an “appendix”, a sort of “bolt-on” – that the NHS does all the “real” work, and Social Workers just “faff” about doing trivial things. This is the result of their lack of comprehension. When I qualified as a Social Worker, I got the distinct impression of a job that many people did not see the purpose (or value) of, and that had a seriously low profile – adding to the lack of understanding and clarity as to what function Social Care actually performed. I would strongly argue that this is why Social Care in general is always so badly hit in terms of budgetary cuts. AND why the profession lacks good numbers of suitable recruits. Where society does not really understand a job, they will certainly be reluctant to fund it – and, incidentally, to DO it!Many people certainly have little to no understanding of PREVENTATIVE services. Again, this is a situation born of ignorance. We live in a society that is obsessed with budget cuts, funding cuts, saving money, making things profitable… For one, I firmly DO NOT believe that the health service should EVER seek to copy private industry – the care of human beings is NOT a money-making scheme. CARE, and GOOD CARE at that, should always and only be first and foremost! Whilst we are so firmly obsessed with profits and cash, we overlook care standards. Not only this, but we seek to take “short cuts” in the hope of saving extra pennies. This often leads to a lack of preventative care, because people just do not get the point of it. Many in Government, I would suspect, think that if a person is not at crisis point, then how poorly actually are they, and do they really need care? I firmly believe that people kid themselves that savings can be made by not providing care until a person is desperately in need (they naively assume that up to this point, the person is caring for him/herself and is therefore “no problem”!). The reality is FAR from this. People who are left until crisis point and up needing far more care, and far more costly care. Quite simply, their illnesses, their problems and their needs have been left to develop to such a state as to be truly staggering. What may have started as a simple illness, or an easily-fixable problem; is now a well-entrenched, chronic illness, or a problem that has gone on so long they can no longer get to the roots of it!I say this, quite simply, because of PERSONAL experience. I have Endometriosis (a Gynaecological complaint). My symptoms began @ 2002, but I was not offered an effective diagnosis or treatment until 2011. THAT meant 9 years of pain, fatigue, stress, chronic illness, and worsening menstrual problems. It also meant an undiagnosed illness festering away in my body. The outcome has lead to 4 surgeries, and infertility! I am pretty certain that had I been diagnosed and treated sooner – had I not been left to reach crisis-point – I might have salvaged my fertility, and have required fewer, less extensive surgeries.Interestingly – I had only vaguely heard of Endometriosis before the diagnosis. Perhaps had I been more aware; had society been more aware; I could have taken some preventative measures? Or I may have been diagnosed faster? I can certainly state that lack of awareness of a condition leads to diagnostic delay, complications, and increased treatment need. And THIS mirrors what I feel about Mental Health care. Lack of early education, lack of awareness, and lack of preventative work leads in the end to diagnostic delays, complications, increased need for inpatient care, and increased need for intensive long-term care.Personally, I think it’s high time that the Social Care profession took the initiative, and did three main things…1. Increase awareness of what Social Care is, and what qualified Social Workers do. This should focus on making society fully clear as to what goes on, and dispelling myths. It should also focus on making sure that potential Social Work trainees know EXACTLY what the job involves (as opposed to some of the people I studied with, who wanted to work in Child Protection because they thought they would be working with cute little babies!) It should further focus on making sure recruits are of the best possible standard, academically and in terms of attitude plus understanding of the job. 2. Consider separating Social Care completely away from Local Authorities, and making it utterly independent. This means that budgets could be completely re-addressed, and that “thresholds” need no longer be manipulated (preventing people in need from getting care). The Social Care profession needs to examine carefully such pilot schemes as exist, in which Social Care is no longer bound to a Local Authority.3. Campaign to reduce stigma for mental illness sufferers. Whilst society continues to have deeply-ingrained prejudices, these WILL affect the quality of care that stigmatized groups receive.The best social work and social care jobsThe online resource for social care professionalsThe biggest and best social care eventGet all the latest information direct to your inbox	Health

It comes as figures reveal that early intervention schemes to help young mental health patients have been reduced over the past 12 months.Mental health trusts are being asked to save almost 20% more from next year's budgets than hospitals.  NHS England says it has put procedures in place to ensure mental and physical health are treated equally in future.  The Mental Health Foundation, Rethink Mental Illness, Mind, the NHS Confederation Mental Health Network and the Centre for Mental Health and the Royal College of Psychiatrists have released a letter on Wednesday warning that planned cuts for next year will put lives at risk as the system is already underfunded.  One charity says half of early intervention programmes aimed at young people have been cut in the past year.Early intervention schemes are intended to reduce suicide rates, prevent patients from becoming more ill and to keep patients out of hospital and in work, and were praised last week by the chief medical officer for England.Sean Duggan, chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, said early intervention programmes were ""very good value for money"" and the prospect of budget cuts was ""very worrying"".""Early Intervention in Psychosis services are known to be highly effective in helping young people to negotiate their first episode of psychosis"", he said. ""They offer hope of a brighter future by helping young people to stay in education, to get and keep work, and to support their physical health.""He described the cuts as a ""false economy"".""They save the NHS £9 and the wider economy another £9 for every £1 invested in them."" He added that the cuts meant young people are now facing delays in getting help.A separate report from the charity Mind shows that mental health patients are losing social care support in greater numbers than elderly or physically-disabled people.  The charity points to research by the London School of Economics which suggests 30,000 people with mental health problems have lost their social care support since 2005, following a £90m shortfall in funding.It also found that one in three local authorities in England halved the number of people with mental health problems receiving social care support.In a statement, NHS England said it had been ""working solidly in its first year now to ensure that mental health no longer inhabits the silo that existed in the old system but is fully embedded in all the work we're doing to deliver outcomes and high quality care"".The US president rejects ""false rumours"" of differences, insisting he and Theresa May ""like each other a lot"".

404	Early intervention teams supporting teenagers and young adults with psychosis are being beset by budget and staffing cuts despite government praise for the ‘internationally recognised’ services, research shows.A survey of 96 of 125 early intervention psychosis services (EIP) in England revealed that 50% had seen their budgets cut in the last year. More than half of EIP services had lost staff (58%) and almost a third (31%) said that their caseloads had exceeded recommended levels. Some teams had been disbanded entirely, while others had seen their functions absorbed into community mental health teams.Psychosis is a medical term used to describe mental health problems that stop the person from thinking clearly, telling the difference between reality and their imagination, and acting in a normal way. The two main symptoms are hallucinations and delusions.Source: NHS ChoicesThe survey was carried out by mental health charity Rethink mental illness and the IRIS network, a group of professionals that support early intervention work.EIP teams support 14 to 35-year-olds to recover from a first episode of psychosis through interventions including family therapy and employment support. The EIP model is praised as an example of ‘internationally recognised’ care in the government’s mental health strategy. Research has suggested the services could save the NHS up to £44 million a year by cutting pressure on hospital beds.Jane Hughes, director of campaigns at Rethink, said that the cuts to EIP teams were leading to young people facing “unacceptable waits” for care, increasing the likelihood of them requiring hospital admission or detention under the Mental Health Act.“That’s why cutting early intervention care makes no sense whatsoever. The human, social and economic costs of are too great, especially at a time when mental health hospitals are completely over-stretched and unable to cope with demand,” she said.Faye Wilson, chair of the British Association of Social Workers’ mental health forum, said EIP services had “one of the strongest evidence bases for early intervention”.“It’s appalling to cut these services. They have been incredibly effective in supporting people’s recovery. As well as working with people around their psychosis, they have done incredible work around things like supporting people back into employment and education,” she said.Wilson said moves to absorb EIP teams into generic community mental health teams risked losing the benefits of intensive support.“Community mental health teams are often running caseloads of 30 or 35 per worker. The recommended caseload for EIP is around 12. With 12 cases you can respond intensively, you can take that whole team and whole life approach and work with support workers to link people into community facilities,” she said.The Rethink report report makes a series of recommendations to improve care, including a call on the government to introduce a maximum waiting time of 28 days for accessing EIP services.Responding to the findings, a Department of Health spokeswoman said: “It’s completely wrong to disadvantage mental health when allocating local funds. We are clear that the NHS must place equal priority on physical and mental health – decisions on how to spend NHS money should reflect this.“Mental health is a priority for this Government which is why we have invested over £450 million into improving access to treatment for people with mental health problems. We are also improving care for people in crisis, setting up ‘street triage’ pilots across the country, investing £25m in liaison and diversion services and asking NHS England to introduce waiting time standards for mental health.”I have been working for the last five years in an EIPS service which is being merged into a larger team. I do think that dedicated EIPS services are unarguably the way to go and it is dissappointing that financial pressures on Mental Health Services are leading to the disbandment and absorption of many EIPS services – a false economy really as EIPS services are very good at keeping people out of hospital.The best social work and social care jobsThe online resource for social care professionalsThe biggest and best social care eventGet all the latest information direct to your inbox	Health

The number of people suffering from mental illness and epilepsy in Northern Region has risen from 4,082 in 2012 to 4,641 in 2013.Mr Abdulai John Ibrahim, Northern Regional Psychiatry Nurse made this known and said those suffering from mental illness were adults from 18 years and above while those with epilepsy were children.Mr Ibrahim announced this when members of the Regional Alliance of Mental Health and Development met in Tamale to assess their activities over the past few months and plan further strategies to address issues of mental health in the region.The Regional Alliance of Mental Health and Development, is a non-governmental organization created by Gub-Katimali Society. It is a group of public agencies and civil society organizations committed to mainstreaming mental health issues into their programmes to address the problem of marginalization affecting mentally ill people.Mr Ibrahim attributed the causes of mental illness to drug abuse, alcoholism and stress.He said despite the increasing mental health cases, the Northern Region lacked adequate facilities including inadequate psychotropic drugs and psychiatry nurses to provide care for patients.He said there were only 17 psychiatry nurses serving all the 26 districts of the region, adding that, some hospitals in the region were also yet to implement the directive to create psychiatry units with at least five beds within their establishments to cater for mental health patients.He said the region did not have vehicles to transport mental health patients to other health facilities for treatment.Sheik Yakubu Abdul-Kareem, Executive Director of Gub-Katimali Society called for more commitment from stakeholders to reduce the number of people suffering from mental health.

The South Carolina State House

Some state lawmakers are looking favorably at the idea of expanding mental health courts in the state as a tool to divert mentally ill defendants from jails or prisons where they cost taxpayers millions of dollars to house and don't receive the treatment they need before their release.The state currently operates mental health courts in Greenville, Columbia and Charleston, offering those suffering mental illness a chance to avoid jail or prison time.Such programs, which operate like the state's drug courts, not only can channel the mentally ill to better treatment options, advocates say, they also can save governments money that would be spent on jail or prison costs.""The court is quite effective and really good,"" 13th Circuit Solicitor Walt Wilkins of Greenville told The Greenville News. ""I'm a big advocate for it.""House Majority Leader Bruce Bannister of Greenville said lawmakers should look at expanding the mental health court after the success of drug courts.""I would anticipate mental health courts would have the same type of success,"" he said.Senate Judiciary Chairman Larry Martin of Pickens said questions would have to be worked out in expanding the program, but he would support reviewing the program.""I would certainly be interested in reviewing the success rate of the circuits that are doing it now,"" he said.""Any way we can avoid incarcerating these folks, getting them the treatment they need and doing justice for the victims involved, I'm certainly open to it.""Senate Corrections Committee Chairman Mike Fair of Greenville said he wasn't familiar with mental health courts but said he ""absolutely"" is interested to trying to have them expand.""I think that would be a good bill to put in the hopper this year,"" he said. ""It would be worth putting in just to stimulate conversation. So that's what I'm going to do.""The state estimates about 12 percent of the state prison system's 22,000 inmates suffer some form of mental illness. At $18,299 per inmate in costs, those that are mentally ill cost approximately $48 million a year.The state's three mental health courts don't take defendants charged with violent or major crimes, officials said, but offer treatment plans for those facing less serious offenses. The courts are overseen by probate judges with the help of prosecutors and mental health professionals.In Richland County's mental health court, 83.3 percent of those completing the program aren't committed or arrested again, according to the program's website. Wilkins said Greenville County's recidivism rate also is low.To be eligible for the courts, which were established by the South Carolina Supreme Court, defendants must have an identifiable form of mental illness, be charged with a misdemeanor or a non-violent felony and are able to understand the terms of their agreement.Defendants can be referred by members of the public, law enforcement, lawyers, prosecutors or mental health professionals.Those charged with criminal domestic violence, lewd act on a minor, DUI, fraudulent checks or any offense in which the victim hasn't consented are excluded from the program.Participants must stay in the program a minimum of three months, if their offense came from magistrate's court, to a maximum of 12 months or the length of their sentence or probation, for those charged with a general sessions offense.Intensive case management and supervision is provided to the participant based on an individualized treatment plan developed for the participant, officials said. As treatment progresses, the participant will move to more traditional mental health services. Participants must report to the court each week, a feature that advocates say ensures accountability.Those who don't complete the program are referred back to the court system. Those who do complete their programs often have their charges dropped. Wilkins said the charges range from shoplifting, to resisting arrest, larceny to simple possession of drugs.""It's a win for the participants,"" said Debora Faulkner, a Greenville County probate judge. ""It's a win for the taxpayers. It stops that revolving door into the jail or the hospital, all of which costs an enormous amount of money.""Faulkner, who has been involved in the program since it began in 2005, said one participant went on to get his Master's degree, while another earned his first paycheck in the program.""We've had a lot of success,"" she said.Faulkner said the Greenville County mental health court started on a grant but the money long ago ran out. She said the professionals involved remain committed to the program because it works so well.The mental health team not only supervises a participant's treatment but also day-to-day needs, such as transportation.Wilkins said Greenville County can only afford about 15 participants at a time.Anderson County Probate Judge Martha Newton said her county's program lasted four or five years until grant money was spent and mental health budgets were cut severely. She said the program was successful and worthwhile until it closed about 2008.She said if lawmakers choose to expand it, they should be sure mental health centers have the funds to help, including for doctors.""It's a wonderful program but it takes money,"" she said.Paton Blough, a Greenville mental health advocate, said the idea of expanding the number of mental health courts resonates among lawmakers he has talked to in the wake of a judge's 45-page order in January that criticized the state prison system for its handling of mentally ill prisoners.He said in Ohio, which operates mental health courts, diversion is estimated to save the state $40,000 per defendant.Mental health advocates are expected to rally at the Statehouse at 10 a.m. Wednesday on the steps to show lawmakers the benefits from mental health treatment.Some state lawmakers are looking favorably at the idea of expanding mental health courts in the state as a tool to divert mentally ill defendants from jails or prisons where they cost taxpayers millions of dollars to house and don't receive the treatment they need before their release.The state currently operates mental health courts in Greenville, Columbia and Charleston, offering those suffering mental illness a chance to avoid jail or prison time.Such programs, which operate like the state's drug courts, not only can channel the mentally ill to better treatment options, advocates say, they also can save governments money that would be spent on jail or prison costs.""The court is quite effective and really good,"" 13th Circuit Solicitor Walt Wilkins of Greenville told The Greenville News.

Adam has a secret. Hes shared it with his family and close friends. In fact, he would like to talk about it more openly. But he doesnt want to use his real name in this story because he fears that people at his new high-tech job will see it and think less of him.



Adam has depression. Since high school, the 27-year-old South Bay resident occasionally has suffered periods when he is more than just blue; he has no energy to get out of bed, and feels hopeless and like hes been hit by a truck.



A few months ago, he considered allowing a reporter to mention his depression in a news story about a community project in which he was involved. His depression was one of the reasons he got involved: I guess I was tired of feeling like I have to hide this piece of me, he says.



But he was job-hunting at the time, and friends worried that prospective employers would see the story online and toss his application. The pragmatist in him conceded, and he asked to keep his depression out of the story. Coming off two years of unemployment in a tough economy, he needed a job. Also, he didnt just need to work to pay his bills; having a job was crucial to his sense of self-worth.

Was Adam being overly cautious? After all, many of us think we live in enlightened times when people dont lose jobs or opportunities because they have depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. But thats not the case. Bay Area mental health advocates point to studies that show people with mental illness have the highest rates of unemployment of all disabled and that half of U.S. employers are reluctant to hire someone with a past psychiatric history or currently undergoing treatment for depression.



The issue reflects our cultures understandably ambiguous feelings about mental health issues.



In one news cycle, a celebrity such as Catherine Zeta-Jones or film such as Silver Linings Playbook is hailed as courageous for presenting positive images of people with mental illness. But the next days stories dwell on how the latest suspect in a mass shooting was hearing voices, fueling the belief that people with mental illness are unreliable, emotionally unstable, even dangerous.



We still have a long way to go, says Lisa Smusz, executive director of PEERS (Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services), an Alameda County-based nonprofit working to end mental health stigma and discrimination.



ONE IN FIVEMore of us are dealing with various forms and degrees of mental illness than we may realize, she says. Nearly 46 million adult Americans  one in five  experienced a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional disorder in the previous year, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.



But while mood and thought disorders are prevalent, they usually are less understood because they are invisible, says Nadine Dixon, a former member of the Berkeley/Albany Mental Health Commission. In a workplace, a persons condition may only show up in subtle behaviors, or in gaps in his work history.



At the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness  along with getting medication, a good therapist and family support and living a healthy lifestyle, says Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.



LOST OPPORTUNITIESWork allows people who tend to isolate and feel inadequate to engage socially and feel needed and successful, experts say. But several Bay Area residents say theyve lost jobs or work opportunities, in a range of industries, because of their disabilities.



A 54-year-old Foster City woman said she was fired from her sales job in March 2013 when her boss said the time she took off for medical appointments  which included visits to her therapist  prevented her from meeting her quotas.



Like Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesnt want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.



Dixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at an East Bay program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelors and masters degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.



But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, shes heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didnt think she fit into the culture.



HONESTY UNHELPFULLike others interviewed, Chris Velarde, 33, of South San Francisco, would like to be open about his bipolar disorder. He receives plaudits for regularly sharing his story with Bay Area medical schools and community organizations as part of the San Mateo County-based Stamp Out Stigma.



But being candid during an interview for a personal trainer job at a gym did not go over well.



I told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually. His interviewer told him, We dont have the time for that.



The lesson for Velarde? He wont be an honest employee again  at least not until after hes landed the job.



State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act.

Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees. Legally, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability when that person can perform the essential functions of the job.

Adam has a secret. Hes shared it with his family and close friends. In fact, he would like to talk about it more openly. But he doesnt want to use his real name in this story because he fears that people at his new high-tech job will see it and think less of him.


Adam has depression. Since high school, the 27-year-old South Bay resident occasionally has suffered periods when he is more than just blue; he has no energy to get out of bed, and feels hopeless and like hes been hit by a truck.



A few months ago, he considered allowing a reporter to mention his depression in a news story about a community project in which he was involved. His depression was one of the reasons he got involved: I guess I was tired of feeling like I have to hide this piece of me, he says.



But he was job-hunting at the time, and friends worried that prospective employers would see the story online and toss his application. The pragmatist in him conceded, and he asked to keep his depression out of the story. Coming off two years of unemployment in a tough economy, he needed a job. Also, he didnt just need to work to pay his bills; having a job was crucial to his sense of self-worth.

Was Adam being overly cautious? After all, many of us think we live in enlightened times when people dont lose jobs or opportunities because they have depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. But thats not the case. Bay Area mental health advocates point to studies that show people with mental illness have the highest rates of unemployment of all disabled and that half of U.S. employers are reluctant to hire someone with a past psychiatric history or currently undergoing treatment for depression.



The issue reflects our cultures understandably ambiguous feelings about mental health issues.



In one news cycle, a celebrity such as Catherine Zeta-Jones or film such as Silver Linings Playbook is hailed as courageous for presenting positive images of people with mental illness. But the next days stories dwell on how the latest suspect in a mass shooting was hearing voices, fueling the belief that people with mental illness are unreliable, emotionally unstable, even dangerous.



We still have a long way to go, says Lisa Smusz, executive director of PEERS (Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services), an Alameda County-based nonprofit working to end mental health stigma and discrimination.



ONE IN FIVEMore of us are dealing with various forms and degrees of mental illness than we may realize, she says. Nearly 46 million adult Americans  one in five  experienced a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional disorder in the previous year, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.



But while mood and thought disorders are prevalent, they usually are less understood because they are invisible, says Nadine Dixon, a former member of the Berkeley/Albany Mental Health Commission. In a workplace, a persons condition may only show up in subtle behaviors, or in gaps in his work history.



At the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness  along with getting medication, a good therapist and family support and living a healthy lifestyle, says Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.



LOST OPPORTUNITIESWork allows people who tend to isolate and feel inadequate to engage socially and feel needed and successful, experts say. But several Bay Area residents say theyve lost jobs or work opportunities, in a range of industries, because of their disabilities.



A 54-year-old Foster City woman said she was fired from her sales job in March 2013 when her boss said the time she took off for medical appointments  which included visits to her therapist  prevented her from meeting her quotas.



Like Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesnt want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.



Dixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at an East Bay program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelors and masters degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.



But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, shes heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didnt think she fit into the culture.



HONESTY UNHELPFULLike others interviewed, Chris Velarde, 33, of South San Francisco, would like to be open about his bipolar disorder. He receives plaudits for regularly sharing his story with Bay Area medical schools and community organizations as part of the San Mateo County-based Stamp Out Stigma.



But being candid during an interview for a personal trainer job at a gym did not go over well.



I told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually. His interviewer told him, We dont have the time for that.



The lesson for Velarde? He wont be an honest employee again  at least not until after hes landed the job.



State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.

A few months ago, he considered allowing a reporter to mention his depression in a news story about a community project in which he was involved. His depression was one of the reasons he got involved: I guess I was tired of feeling like I have to hide this piece of me, he says.



But he was job-hunting at the time, and friends worried that prospective employers would see the story online and toss his application.

Was Adam being overly cautious? After all, many of us think we live in enlightened times when people dont lose jobs or opportunities because they have depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. But thats not the case. Bay Area mental health advocates point to studies that show people with mental illness have the highest rates of unemployment of all disabled and that half of U.S. employers are reluctant to hire someone with a past psychiatric history or currently undergoing treatment for depression.



The issue reflects our cultures understandably ambiguous feelings about mental health issues.



In one news cycle, a celebrity such as Catherine Zeta-Jones or film such as Silver Linings Playbook is hailed as courageous for presenting positive images of people with mental illness. But the next days stories dwell on how the latest suspect in a mass shooting was hearing voices, fueling the belief that people with mental illness are unreliable, emotionally unstable, even dangerous.



We still have a long way to go, says Lisa Smusz, executive director of PEERS (Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services), an Alameda County-based nonprofit working to end mental health stigma and discrimination.



ONE IN FIVEMore of us are dealing with various forms and degrees of mental illness than we may realize, she says. Nearly 46 million adult Americans  one in five  experienced a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional disorder in the previous year, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.



But while mood and thought disorders are prevalent, they usually are less understood because they are invisible, says Nadine Dixon, a former member of the Berkeley/Albany Mental Health Commission. In a workplace, a persons condition may only show up in subtle behaviors, or in gaps in his work history.



At the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness  along with getting medication, a good therapist and family support and living a healthy lifestyle, says Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.



LOST OPPORTUNITIESWork allows people who tend to isolate and feel inadequate to engage socially and feel needed and successful, experts say. But several Bay Area residents say theyve lost jobs or work opportunities, in a range of industries, because of their disabilities.



A 54-year-old Foster City woman said she was fired from her sales job in March 2013 when her boss said the time she took off for medical appointments  which included visits to her therapist  prevented her from meeting her quotas.



Like Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesnt want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.



Dixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at an East Bay program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelors and masters degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.



But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, shes heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didnt think she fit into the culture.



HONESTY UNHELPFULLike others interviewed, Chris Velarde, 33, of South San Francisco, would like to be open about his bipolar disorder. He receives plaudits for regularly sharing his story with Bay Area medical schools and community organizations as part of the San Mateo County-based Stamp Out Stigma.



But being candid during an interview for a personal trainer job at a gym did not go over well.



I told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually. His interviewer told him, We dont have the time for that.



The lesson for Velarde? He wont be an honest employee again  at least not until after hes landed the job.



State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.



Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .

At the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness  along with getting medication, a good therapist and family support and living a healthy lifestyle, says Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.



LOST OPPORTUNITIESWork allows people who tend to isolate and feel inadequate to engage socially and feel needed and successful, experts say. But several Bay Area residents say theyve lost jobs or work opportunities, in a range of industries, because of their disabilities.



A 54-year-old Foster City woman said she was fired from her sales job in March 2013 when her boss said the time she took off for medical appointments  which included visits to her therapist  prevented her from meeting her quotas.



Like Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesnt want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.



Dixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at an East Bay program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelors and masters degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.



But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, shes heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didnt think she fit into the culture.

He receives plaudits for regularly sharing his story with Bay Area medical schools and community organizations as part of the San Mateo County-based Stamp Out Stigma.



But being candid during an interview for a personal trainer job at a gym did not go over well.



I told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually. His interviewer told him, We dont have the time for that.



The lesson for Velarde? He wont be an honest employee again  at least not until after hes landed the job.



State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.



Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees.

Was Adam being overly cautious? After all, many of us think we live in enlightened times when people dont lose jobs or opportunities because they have depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. But thats not the case. Bay Area mental health advocates point to studies that show people with mental illness have the highest rates of unemployment of all disabled and that half of U.S. employers are reluctant to hire someone with a past psychiatric history or currently undergoing treatment for depression.



The issue reflects our cultures understandably ambiguous feelings about mental health issues.



In one news cycle, a celebrity such as Catherine Zeta-Jones or film such as Silver Linings Playbook is hailed as courageous for presenting positive images of people with mental illness. But the next days stories dwell on how the latest suspect in a mass shooting was hearing voices, fueling the belief that people with mental illness are unreliable, emotionally unstable, even dangerous.

She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelors and masters degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.



But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, shes heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didnt think she fit into the culture.

He receives plaudits for regularly sharing his story with Bay Area medical schools and community organizations as part of the San Mateo County-based Stamp Out Stigma.



But being candid during an interview for a personal trainer job at a gym did not go over well.



I told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually. His interviewer told him, We dont have the time for that.



The lesson for Velarde? He wont be an honest employee again  at least not until after hes landed the job.



State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.



Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees. Legally, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability when that person can perform the essential functions of the job.

In one news cycle, a celebrity such as Catherine Zeta-Jones or film such as Silver Linings Playbook is hailed as courageous for presenting positive images of people with mental illness. But the next days stories dwell on how the latest suspect in a mass shooting was hearing voices, fueling the belief that people with mental illness are unreliable, emotionally unstable, even dangerous.

Nearly 46 million adult Americans  one in five  experienced a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional disorder in the previous year, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.



But while mood and thought disorders are prevalent, they usually are less understood because they are invisible, says Nadine Dixon, a former member of the Berkeley/Albany Mental Health Commission. In a workplace, a persons condition may only show up in subtle behaviors, or in gaps in his work history.



At the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness  along with getting medication, a good therapist and family support and living a healthy lifestyle, says Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.

Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.



Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees. Legally, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability when that person can perform the essential functions of the job.

Employers can find strategies to address mental health issues and reduce stigma at the Right Direction website. The website, with a downloadable toolkit, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation.



ONE IN FIVEMore of us are dealing with various forms and degrees of mental illness than we may realize, she says. Nearly 46 million adult Americans  one in five  experienced a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional disorder in the previous year, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.



But while mood and thought disorders are prevalent, they usually are less understood because they are invisible, says Nadine Dixon, a former member of the Berkeley/Albany Mental Health Commission. In a workplace, a persons condition may only show up in subtle behaviors, or in gaps in his work history.



At the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness  along with getting medication, a good therapist and family support and living a healthy lifestyle, says Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.



LOST OPPORTUNITIESWork allows people who tend to isolate and feel inadequate to engage socially and feel needed and successful, experts say. But several Bay Area residents say theyve lost jobs or work opportunities, in a range of industries, because of their disabilities.



A 54-year-old Foster City woman said she was fired from her sales job in March 2013 when her boss said the time she took off for medical appointments  which included visits to her therapist  prevented her from meeting her quotas.



Like Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesnt want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.



Dixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at an East Bay program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelors and masters degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.



But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, shes heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didnt think she fit into the culture.



HONESTY UNHELPFULLike others interviewed, Chris Velarde, 33, of South San Francisco, would like to be open about his bipolar disorder. He receives plaudits for regularly sharing his story with Bay Area medical schools and community organizations as part of the San Mateo County-based Stamp Out Stigma.



But being candid during an interview for a personal trainer job at a gym did not go over well.



I told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually. His interviewer told him, We dont have the time for that.



The lesson for Velarde? He wont be an honest employee again  at least not until after hes landed the job.



State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.

The lesson for Velarde? He wont be an honest employee again  at least not until after hes landed the job.



State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.



Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees. Legally, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability when that person can perform the essential functions of the job.

At the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness  along with getting medication, a good therapist and family support and living a healthy lifestyle, says Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.


LOST OPPORTUNITIESWork allows people who tend to isolate and feel inadequate to engage socially and feel needed and successful, experts say. But several Bay Area residents say theyve lost jobs or work opportunities, in a range of industries, because of their disabilities.



A 54-year-old Foster City woman said she was fired from her sales job in March 2013 when her boss said the time she took off for medical appointments  which included visits to her therapist  prevented her from meeting her quotas.



Like Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesnt want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.



Dixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at an East Bay program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelors and masters degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.



But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, shes heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didnt think she fit into the culture.

He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.

Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees.

Like Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesnt want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.



Dixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at an East Bay program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelors and masters degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.



But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, shes heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didnt think she fit into the culture.

I told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually. His interviewer told him, We dont have the time for that.

State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.

State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.



Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees. Legally, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability when that person can perform the essential functions of the job.

The lesson for Velarde? He wont be an honest employee again  at least not until after hes landed the job.



State and federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, says Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.



Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders says. This is especially true for people who work in any field  from law enforcement to high tech  where depression or anxiety could be viewed as a weakness.



By law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.



Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees. Legally, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability when that person can perform the essential functions of the job.

Employers can find strategies to address mental health issues and reduce stigma at the Right Direction website. The website, with a downloadable toolkit, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation.



On a positive note, Saunders adds that in most disputes hes handled between an employer and a worker, weve been able to work things out.



Often its just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesnt lessen a persons ability to be a productive employee, he says.



HANDS-OFF TOPICFor employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not being a team player, says Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, a national Ohio-based employer coalition. But they havent before had a way to address the subject. Its a hands-off topic, he says.



He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles says.



The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.



A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.



Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.



Research shows that people who have disclosed aspects of their mental illness report an enhanced sense of empowerment and self-confidence that allows them to achieve personal and professional goals, according to the Coming Out Proud manual.



The manual, however, notes that disclosure is risky, especially in the workplace. If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed. The manual, which has a workbook that helps people weigh the pros and cons of disclosure and strategies for effectively sharing their stories, is available at .



The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees. Legally, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability when that person can perform the essential functions of the job.

If youre job-hunting, sharing information about your illness can hurt your chances of getting hired, which is why Oakland attorney Chad Saunders, who specializes in employment discrimination, usually advises people to not say anything until theyve secured the position.



If you open up about your condition in your current job, you could be shunned by co-workers, denied opportunities for advancement and even let go, the manual says. On the other hand, co-workers might help you out  dealing with a difficult boss, for example. Co-workers also might reveal similar challenges, and you may find a boss willing to help you stay in your job and succeed.

The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Californias Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibit employment discrimination for those with mental health challenges at public and private employers with five or more employees. Legally, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability when that person can perform the essential functions of the job.

A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with lived experience sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are funded by Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health consumers to work in mental health organizations.


Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregons state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder  a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  is considered an asset.



Its the first place where Ive been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present, he says. Thats cool for me personally, that Ive been hired not despite of my experiences but because of those experiences.

408	Adam has a secret. He’s shared it with his family and close friends. In fact, he would like to talk about it more openly. But he doesn’t want to use his real name in this story because he fears that people at his new high-tech job will see it and think less of him.Adam has depression. Since high school, the 27-year-old California resident occasionally has suffered periods when he is more than just blue; he has no energy to get out of bed, feels hopeless and like he’s “been hit by a truck.”A few months ago, he considered allowing a reporter to mention his depression in a news story about a community project in which he was involved. His depression was one of the reasons he got involved: “I guess I was tired of feeling like I have to hide this piece of me,” he says.But he was job-hunting at the time, and friends worried that prospective employers would see the story online and toss his application. The pragmatist in him conceded, and he asked to keep his depression out of the story. Coming off two years of unemployment in a tough economy, he needed a job. Also, he didn’t just need to work to pay his bills; having a job was crucial to his sense of self-worth.Was Adam being overly cautious? After all, many of us think we live in enlightened times when people don’t lose jobs or opportunities because they have depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. But that’s not the case. Mental health advocates point to studies that show people with mental illness have the highest rates of unemployment of all disabled and that half of U.S. employers are reluctant to hire someone with a past psychiatric history or currently undergoing treatment for depression.The issue reflects our culture’s understandably ambiguous feelings about mental health issues.In one news cycle, a celebrity such as Catherine Zeta-Jones or a film such as “Silver Linings Playbook” is hailed as courageous for presenting positive images of people with mental illness. But the next day’s story dwells on how the latest suspect in a mass shooting was hearing voices, fueling the belief that people with mental illness are unreliable, emotionally unstable, even dangerous.“We still have a long way to go,” said Lisa Smusz, executive director of Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services, or PEERS, an Alameda County, Calif.-based nonprofit working to end mental health stigma and discrimination.More of us are dealing with various forms and degrees than we may realize, she said. Nearly 46 million adult Americans — one in five — experienced a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional disorder in the previous year, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.But while mood and thought disorders are prevalent, they usually are less understood because they are “invisible,” said Nadine Dixon, a former member of the Berkeley/Albany Mental Health Commission in Berkeley, Calif. In a workplace, a person’s condition may only show up in subtle ways he behaves, or in gaps in his work history.At the same time, the ability to work is an important part of recovering from mental illness — along with getting medication, a good therapist, family support and living healthy lifestyle, said Brian Hill of Black Men Speak, an organization that helps African-American men with mental health challenges.Work allows people who tend to isolate and feel inadequate to engage socially and feel needed and successful, experts say. But several San Francisco Bay Area residents say they’ve lost jobs or work opportunities, in a range of industries, because of their disabilities.A 54-year-old Foster City, Calif., woman said she was fired from her sales job in March 2013 when her boss said the time she took off for medical appointments — which included visits to her therapist — prevented her from meeting her quotas.Like Adam, she asked that her name not be used because she doesn’t want it associated with her diagnosis in online searches.Dixon, of the health commission, understands the challenge firsthand. She received stellar reviews for the 13 months she worked at a program that provides housing for low-income single mothers. She figured that her life experiences made her a strong advocate for her clients. She raised a daughter and worked low-wage jobs. As her mental health stabilized in her late 40s, she went to college and earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics and public policy from Mills College.But a new boss came in, and Dixon lost her job a month later. Since then, she’s heard from colleagues that a new supervisor was making inaccurate statements about her condition. More recently, Dixon interviewed with a global consulting firm and was told that they really liked her, but the company only offered her a temporary contract because they didn’t think she “fit into the culture.”Like others interviewed, Chris Velarde, 33, of South San Francisco, would like to be open about his bipolar disorder. He receives plaudits for regularly sharing his story with Bay Area medical schools and community organizations as part of the San Mateo County, Calif.-based Stamp Out Stigma.But being candid during an interview for a personal trainer job at a gym did not go over well.“I told them because I wanted them to know there might be special issues. I wanted to be an honest employee and figured they were going to find out eventually.” His interviewer told him, “We don’t have the time for that.”The lesson for Velarde? He won’t be an “honest employee” again — at least not until after he’s landed the job.The person who rejected Velarde may have been breaking the law. Federal laws prohibit discrimination against people with mental illness in the workplace and in hiring, said Chad Saunders, an Oakland attorney who is also interim president of the PEERS board of directors.Still, employers simply may choose not to consider an applicant they suspect has a mental illness, and workers are hesitant to ask for time off or other accommodations for their illness, Saunders said. This is especially true for people who work in any field — from law enforcement to high tech — where depression or anxiety could be viewed as “a weakness.”By law, employers must provide “reasonable accommodations” for people who can perform the functions of the job. Accommodations can include flexible hours, modifying how feedback is given or allowing someone prone to anxiety to work in a quiet room rather than a noisy open office.On a positive note, Saunders added that in most disputes he’s handled between an employer and a worker, “we’ve been able to work things out.”Often it’s just a matter of helping an employer understand that a mental illness doesn’t lessen a person’s ability to be a productive employee, he said.For employers, they may be frustrated by an otherwise good worker who is calling in sick, lacks focus or is not “being a team player,” said Marcas Miles, director of programs and communications at Employers Health, an Ohio-based national employer coalition. “But they haven’t before had a way to address the subject. It's a hands-off topic,” he said.He also cites figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that depression costs employers as much as $44 billion a year in lost workdays. Realizing their bottom line could improve by helping workers, employers are starting to get on board with a new initiative to reduce stigma around mental illness, Miles said.The initiative, the Right Direction, was created by Employers Health and the Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, a program of the American Psychiatric Foundation. The Right Direction website includes a downloadable tool kit that provides businesses with strategies to reduce stigma in the workplace.A new host of anti-stigma campaigns have also been launched at the state and county levels and involve people with “lived experience” sharing their stories in a variety of public settings, including workplaces. These campaigns are in part funded by California Proposition 63, the Mental Health Services Act. Proposition 63 also aims to close the employment gap by training mental health “consumers” to work in mental health organizations.Julian Plumadore worked for 30 years in Oregon’s state government but is much happier in his job as a community advocate for the Mental Health Commission of San Francisco. For one thing, managing his schizoaffective disorder — a condition that features symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia — is considered an asset.“It’s the first place where I’ve been able to be completely open and honest about my past and present,” he said. “That’s cool for me personally, that I’ve been hired not despite of my experiences, but because of those experiences.”	Health
409	"COPYRIGHTOntario's record in improving services for those with mental illness and, in particular, those with the most serious of illnesses is totally reprehensible. So, imagine my surprise when I read an article by Toronto Star columnist Carol Goar who wrote glowingly about Liberal MPP Kevin Flynn and his crusading for mental health. I have no doubt about his commitment but he is part of a ruling party that has none, based on its record. Flynn chaired the all party Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions that issued an excellent report in 2010. Problem is that it has been a mostly ignored report.That report had 22 very specific recommendations and the headline on my letter to the editor of the Star about the Goar column read  ""Excellent Report Had Little Impact."" I decided to question my own Liberal MPP who is also in cabinet on why so little has been done and we got into an email exchange. His initial comment was that the committee recommendations were rolled into a subsequent report issued a year later called Open Minds Healthy Minds.His responses to my emails were so Kafkesque that a friend likened talking to a politician as trying to swim in jello. My MPP said he is personally in favour of improvements as he sits on the board of a local mental health agency and he encouraged me to advocate as well. My reply was that the agency has no power to set government policy or to allocate funds and nor do I. The cabinet does and he is in the cabinet so... His reply to that was to congratulate me for my advocacy and to encourage me to continue.Like I can personally bring about changes when the government refuses to.My Star letter pointed out that the original committee recommended that Ontario investigate and change the Mental Health Act pertaining to involuntary admission and treatment. In fact, the committee cited how impressed they were with how this issue is handled in British Columbia, Norway and The Netherlands. Recommendation 21 and never done. The committee recommended that Ontario re-evalute its Personal Health Protection Act. That Act prevents health care officials from revealing information to families about their adult children and, as a result, families cannot help prevent further deterioration and to minimize the risk of serious physical or psychological harm. Again the committee was impressed with how well British Columbia accomplished this. That is recommendation 22 and again, nothing has been done. Since that report was shelved for the new one a year later, we should look at what this new report recommends and what has been accomplished. But first, the Select Committee Report of 2010 was actually initiated to replace an earlier report that the Liberal government inherited when they first took power from the Tories in 2003. Called the Time Is Now, that report was co-chaired by former federal cabinet minister Michael Wilson who called the Ontario mental health system something that was based on 30 years of neglect. The incoming Liberals assured all that they would study the report and take action. They did not, as my first Huffington Post blog in 2011 pointed out. Interestingly, the Time is Now report has been removed from the government website.As for the latest report, it sets out quite a few very vague, pie in the sky goals with no explanation of how they are going to be achieved and that reflect a lack of understanding of serious mental illness. The very first is that they plan to reduce the prevalence of mental health and addictions in Ontario and reduce suicides. When science does not know what causes these illnesses how is it then possible to prevent them? Inoculations prevent diseases like polio and good sanitary practices prevent cholera but how do you prevent autism or schizophrenia? I guess the government could prevent Post Traumatic Stress Disorder if it were able to prevent any of its citizens from ever suffering from severe trauma.In order to accomplish all it sets out to do, the government is to:Develop common performance measures with clear accountabilities;Set up an Advisory Council; Establish a task force to examine current Ontario legislation related to involuntary treatment and sharing of health information (e.g., Mental Health Act, Child and Family Services Act, Personal Health Information Protection Act). Note this is a carryover from the 2010 report;Report to the citizens on their progress every two years (which should have been done in 2013.No indication of any of these having been done is available on the the government website but I am told that the government is working with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Services (ICES) to develop a scorecard and evaluation framework for the strategy. No advisory group, however, has been set upAnd, if we consider autism as a mental illness which would be included in the deliberations for the Open Minds Healthy Minds report, then the government has totally failed. According to a report in the Toronto Star on March 7, 2014, Ontario is also failing those with autism. A not yet published government report dated December, 2013 that the Star was able to acquire found that ""Parents spoke of confusion trying to navigate a convoluted system, lack of transparency about wait lists and how agencies make decisions about who is eligible for treatment and how long they get it,"" along with other problems.Ontario has recently seen a number of inquests into police shootings involving people with serious mental illnesses and National Post columnist Christie Blatchford made some excellent points. She stated that:""The critical thing these poor people had in common, it seems to me, was not that they were shot by police, but how ill-served they and their loving families were by the shambles of what passes as the mental health care system in this province."" And she is so right. Because of that column, a mother with a son with schizophrenia wrote to Blatchford privately and has given me permission to use her information. I'm not mentioning her name to protect the privacy of her son as requested but she is a freelance writer in Vancouver. Her son was in Toronto on at least two occasions when he received Ontario services for his illness.She said:""There is something very wrong with Ontario. My son was kicked out of psych emerg in 2011 (Toronto Western Hospital: ""All he needs is a sandwich"", the psych nurse told me, on long distance telephone to Vancouver. I was frantic.) When he finally and miraculously returned to B C, he spent the next 10 months in hospital, till they closed Riverview. He is doing OK at the moment, not great, but way better than Ontario. If he had stayed in Ontario I have no doubt in my mind that he would now be dead.""And""Ten years ago, again in Toronto, my son was turfed out of hospital (St. Mikes) after a couple of weeks, at night, into freezing February winter, with no money, no friends or relatives at hand ... nothing. It was a terrifying scramble for us, 3,000 miles away, to try to get him into a hotel so he wouldn't freeze to death on the streets. Looks like nothing has changed.""She concluded with:""Ontario, or at least Toronto, is indeed a very mean place to be, if you have a mental illness.""And no amount of government committees can change any of that if all they do is meet, listen and ignore. Premier Kathleen Wynne seems like a nice lady -- a mother and a grandmother. I would not wish this on her but imagine if one of your grandkids developed schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, would you be satisfied with the services they would get? Put yourself in those shoes, Wynne, and get off your butt and start to do something.And, as for my MPP, don't knock on my door come next election looking for my vote.    ALSO ON HUFFPOST:

410	"Sunny with gusty winds. High near 65F. Winds SSW at 20 to 30 mph. Winds could occasionally gust over 40 mph..Windy with clear skies. Low 39F. Winds SSW at 25 to 35 mph. Winds could occasionally gust over 40 mph. Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 12:35 pmBy Leilana McKindra OKLAHOMA CITY — Russell Westbrook is continuing the relationship pingpong he started when he supported his teammate, Paul George, after learning Tuesday that George had not made the All-Star Game. A state question meant to make strong beer and wine sales less cumbersome in Oklahoma, is now threatening to close some low point beer pubs and bars if the county residents where they do business fail to pass liquor by the drink measures soon.  So apparently 2018 is in a few days, which is weird because 2005 was just last year. I don’t know how that is possible but okay. I’ll roll with it. The first Woodward Chamber luncheon of the year brought a nearly packed house as more than 120 crammed into the Pioneer Room to get a sneak peek at the production ""The Music Man"" and hear from Terri White, Oklahoma Commissioner of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.Newly promoted Red Cross Area Coordinator Mary Ann White also offered an update on her new position overseeing the entire Northwest Oklahoma region as well as a reminder that the local office needs volunteers.""Also, the Red Cross fundraiser Friday night was really great and everyone enjoyed our dueling pianos,"" White said.She also took a moment to recognize Bruce and Sheryl Benbrook as the recipients of the Red Cross Humanitarian Award.""And finally, I want to say that in two years, Red Cross will be celebrating their 100th year of existence here,"" White said. ""And that says a lot of this community, because it is supported totally by private dollars that come from this community.""In what turned out like the popular commercials that air during the Super Bowl; performers from the coming production by Woodward Civic Opera, ""The Music Man,"" broke out unexpectedly in song and dance throughout the meeting.The micro-performances included a barbershop quartet (Shawn Denney, Charlie Burns, Dave Wallace and Cody Amparan) singing ""It's You"" and soloist, Greg Nuse who sang ""76 Trombones.""White offered some sobering facts about the overall health of Oklahomans.At present, Oklahoma has the second highest rate of mental illness of all the states in the US, she said.In Oklahoma, a youth is, on average, 12-years-old when they take their first drink and alcohol is still the number one substance adults and children are addicted to, she said.Mental illness is the third leading chronic illness in Oklahoma and the state ranks 13th in the US for death by suicide.""And yet we rank 45th in spending on treatment for mental illness and addiction,"" she said. ""And with treatment, recovery can and does happen.""According to White, mental health and addiction in this state has traditionally been stigmatized as well as considered a weakness and not a disease.""But mental illness and addiction is a disease just like diabetes and asthma,"" she said. ""They just happen to be a disease of the brain.""White explained mental illness and addiction as a chemical imbalance just like diabetes is a chemical imbalance.""And you wouldn't tell someone to just get over it, if they had diabetes or asthma, you would treat them,"" she said. ""But the treatment gap is huge.""That is because programs started in years past are on the cutting table as a result of a nearly $21 million shortfall this year in the departmental budget.That means in Woodward, there will be 3,439 adults who will need treatment for mental illness this year and only 768 will receive help, she said.""And I am not talking about having a bad day, or you have lost someone and you are grieving, I am talking about a serious mental illness,"" she said.The budget shortfall also means 465 children will need treatment for severe mental illness and only 189 will be able to be served.That doesn't even include treatment for addiction for children and adults, she said.  The need for those services also outstrips the current ability for the department to keep up, White said.""So that means 232 youth in Woodward needed treatment for substance abuse last year and 13 got treatment,"" she said. ""Because every bed we have is full.""In the Woodward area, services are generally sought through Northwest Center for Behavioral Health just off Oklahoma, according to NCBH Executive Director Trudy Hoffman.NCBH serves 13 counties and has more than 270 employees.The services include outpatient appointments  in Alva, Enid, Fairview, Guymon and Woodward for both substance abuse, mental illness evaluation, group counseling, medication evaluation and individual counseling, among others, Hoffman said.For those who need intensive treatment  for substance abuse in an inpatient facility,  the Lighthouse Substance Abuse Services program on Highway 270 south of Woodward is available but very often full, Hoffman said.For acute care patients who need intensive inpatient treatment, the Northwest Center for Behavioral Health Acute Care Unit is located in Fort Supply. The facility has a 28 bed unit and meets the needs of high risk clients who might hurt themselves or someone else, Hoffman  said.But those services are tapped out most of the time, according to White.And the cost to the state for this treatment shortfall is significant, she said.Employers spend millions paying for physical illnesses that stem from untreated mental illness. That doesn't even include the lost days of work, the increased incidence of workplace accidents and the increased demands on law enforcement, she said.According to White, it costs $23,000 to incarcerate a non-violent offender for drugs and with drug court, it costs $5,000. Recidivism rates from drug court average less than 25 percent. Recidivism rates for incarceration average more than 50 percent, she said.""There are people in this room, if you know the statistics, who are here living productive lives who received treatment so we know treatment works,"" White said.Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

411	"Maryland lawmakers are moving to make it easier to medicate mental hospital patients against their will, while examining the idea of court-ordered therapy for mentally ill people who aren't hospitalized. The legislation is based partly on recommendations from a panel convened by Gov. Martin O'Malley after the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. That case prompted a national debate about the adequacy of care for mentally ill Americans.But while some mental health advocates have long sought additional tools to better manage treatment — for the sake of the patient and public safety — the proposals have created a rift in the health care community. Some argue such measures are inhumane and unconstitutional.""This is part of the dilemma in choosing between, on the one hand, necessary treatment, and having high respect for people's individual rights,"" said Del. Dan Morhaim, the General Assembly's only physician and sponsor of the medication legislation. ""We are trying to strike the right balance and really help those who need it.""The state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene supports legislation that would expand the circumstances under which a doctor could medicate mental health patients without their consent. In those cases, as a check and balance, a review must be done by a clinical panel. Health officials argue that the longer patients go without treatment, the worse their illness and chances for recovery become.Some lawmakers want further study of a proposal that would allow patients to be forced to get outpatient treatment. They also want an outside panel to study other alternatives, such targeted outreach efforts called ""assertive community treatment"" that engage those with mental illnesses rather than forcing treatment.Other measures that would make it easier to have people committed are less assured of passage. One bill would clarify the criteria needed to have somebody hospitalized when they have a psychotic break, but opponents warned the commitment process could be abused. A Senate committee voted against that proposal.The state health department supports clarifying the standards for hospitalization of mentally ill patients, but it would rather see changes made through regulation, not legislation. Under the law, patients must be deemed a danger before they can be hospitalized, but practitioners and institutions widely interpret the definition of dangerous.The health department recently studied deficiencies in the state's behavioral health system that led to periods without care for those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and other conditions. Those breaks can on rare occasions lead to dangerous situations.""There are some people that may not be in a position where they can make decisions about their treatment,"" said Dr. Gayle Jordan-Randolph, deputy secretary for behavioral health at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who chaired the panel.But balancing the need for treatment against individual rights is difficult, experts said. Forcing people into treatment may not be effective, said Linda Raines, chief executive officer of the Mental Health Association of Maryland. She said it might be more effective to engage patients and help them understand they need help. ""Why don't we give people the option first to let them self-select what will make them better,"" Raines said.She called some of the legislation proposed in the General Assembly a ""substantial and frightening step backward"" that would merely increase the number of people who are institutionalized.Others say steps must be taken to ensure the mentally ill get the care they need before a crisis occurs. In fiscal year 2012, an analysis of Medicaid data found that 588 people, or less than 1 percent of the state's mental health population, accounted for one-quarter of all emergency department visits. Those patients visited the emergency department six or more times in a year. Many are believed to have a mental disorder called anosognosia, which causes them not to recognize that they are sick. Some families of mentally ill patients say they can't afford to wait for more studies.Dr. Steven Sharfstein, CEO of Sheppard Pratt Health System, supports mandatory treatment options because he has seen families desperate to help their loved ones. Doctors sometimes tell them the only way their relatives can get help is if they get arrested, he said.""Families will tell you about how frustrated and frightened they are because their family member won't get care and how much havoc it creates,"" Sharfstein said.Some mental health advocates back mandatory outpatient care as a way to ensure consistent care and fewer hospital visits. Many patients learn to manipulate the system, adhering to treatment while institutionalized but going back to their old ways once released, advocates said.""There are people who cycle in and out and don't get stabilized in the community,"" said Kate Farinholt, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Maryland. ""They end up getting released into the community with recommended treatment, with a history of not getting that recommended treatment, and becoming dangerous to themselves or others and getting hospitalized again. Or worse yet, picked up and put in jail or prison.""The Mental Health Association of Maryland and Maryland Disability Law Center support a community approach to treatment that provides basic services such as housing to improve the living conditions — and mental state — of the mentally ill. ""Assertive community treatment"" programs have been successful in other states, but have proved expensive. New York has spent $2 billion on its program.""As a general principal, we do not believe coercion is a benefit to anyone in the long run,"" said Laura Cain, managing attorney for the Maryland Disability Law Center. ""We believe there are alternatives to engage people voluntarily. In the longer run, when a person becomes motivated on their own, that is where recovery actually begins.""Tonier Cane said she is an example of how forced treatment doesn't work. The 46-year-old Annapolis motivational speaker was in and out of jail and mental institutions for 19 years beginning in 1989. She blames her bipolar disorder, depression and drug addiction.At one point, she was taking three medications for her mental disorder and was so drugged she drooled, could barely walk and couldn't hold her head up.But she said she didn't get better until she got into a program that addressed the underlying trauma — sexual abuse as a child — that caused her illnesses. She now has coping mechanisms, such as reading, that help her adjust when she feels anxiety beginning to build.""You can't force anything on anybody because it is not going to be received well,"" Cane said. ""That does not work.""andrea.walker@baltsun.comtwitter.com/ankwalker"	Health
412	"I have dedicated my professional life to community mental health. After nearly 30 years in the field, I have witnessed vast challenges and changes to mental health delivery in Connecticut. Stigma and the tragic repercussions of severe mental illness result in a profoundly vulnerable population with minimal political clout.The need for behavioral health services is ever-increasing, while budgets continue to shrink. Our nonprofit agency, which was founded and built on a mission to serve those with severe and prolonged mental illness stands to lose all remaining funding from the state for outpatient behavioral health services this year. The rationale is that due to expected increases in ""third-party payments"" from more people being insured under the Affordable Care Act, we are expected to be self-sufficient.But given our reimbursement rates from Medicaid and Medicare, providing certain services actually results in a net loss of revenue. Can we at least agree that we should not abandon those in our community with mental illness?Kate Calvin, GlastonburyThe writer is a psychotherapist at InterCommunity in East Hartford."	Health
413	"Kudos to The Courant for the attention given to the issue of mental health and the challenges faced by families and individuals dealing with mental illness. The op-ed by Dr. Harold Schwartz [Feb. 28, courantopinion.com, ""Money At Root Of Mental Health Care Woes""] and the heartfelt story of a son's mental illness by Liza Long [March 1, op-ed, ""Long Road To Find Care For Mental Illness""] speak to the multiple challenges faced by those suffering, either related to financial limits or stigma. There is no time to waste in addressing these issues, and political action, while welcome, takes too long. Individuals and communities can begin to make a difference right now.If any town or region is looking for a model, through a local collaborative effort, we have begun a community mental health fund. Local faith communities, in conjunction with Andover, Hebron, Marlborough Youth and Family Services, now have a fund that offers financial support to families in our towns, subsidizing mental health services for those who cannot afford to carry the full burden alone, whether for hospitalization, counseling or prescriptions. It is our hope that as awareness grows about mental health, more communities will find ways to address the emotional and practical challenges for those who suffer from mental illness, supporting both them and their family members who suffer along with them.Joel Rosenberg and Stephanie Haines, HebronThe writers are executive director of Andover, Hebron, Marlborough Youth and Family Services, and minister of mission for the Gilead Congregational Church."

The Boston Bar Association president calls specialty courts ""the wave of the future.""In his most recent budget, Gov. Deval Patrick has called for increasing the number of mental health courts from four to six. These courts operate in a much different way than traditional courts.In the traditional court, a defendant with a mental illness may be convicted and sentenced to jail time and probation. In the mental health court, the defendant pleads guilty and is sentenced to a different kind of probation: instead of going to prison, participants receive mental health treatment with substantial oversight.Rather than having a probation officer check in once a month to make sure they are not breaking any laws, participants in mental health court are assigned a case manager and a probation officer. They are connected to mental health services in the community and have to check in with the court judge every week.Judge Rosemary Minehan, Plymouth District Court judge who has presided over the mental health court since 2011 and chairs the District Court Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse.Dr. Debra Pinals, assistant commissioner of Forensic Mental Health Services for the state Department of Mental Health.WBUR ""(T)here are strict criteria, including a verifiable history of mental illness, and a defendant must agree to participate in a rigorous treatment plan. That plan involves not only counseling, but weekly appearances before a judge, who almost acts like a therapist.""Bureau of Justice Statistics ""More than half of all prison and jail inmates, including 56 percent of state prisoners, 45 percent of federal prisoners and 64 percent of local jail inmates, were found to have a mental health problem.""National Center for State Courts ""(M)ore research is desperately needed to sift through the diverse array of problem-solving approaches and, before the cart gets too far ahead of the horse, help refine current knowledge and understanding of which programs work, for whom, and why.""Council of State Governments Justice Center ""(P)reliminary evidence indicates that mental health court participation is associated with positive outcomes in several categories, including lower criminal recidivism rates, increased treatment engagement, and cost savings.

Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 10:53 amWe knew that the actions in Vietnam were flawed and taking our country in the wrong direction when we heard one of the generals explain battle field conduct saying: “We destroyed the village to save it.”On Saturday, the newspaper reported on a similar tragedy. Our friend Jim Ness, apparently depressed and possibly suicidal, was pursued by law enforcement officers and in a confrontation shot dead. The village was destroyed to save it.The underlying issue of course is the inadequacy of our mental health system. For those suffering from a mental illness, the stigma still deters many from seeking help and treatment. For those intervening when a person with mental illness suffers a debilitating episode, when the illness surfaces and the individual reacts, we still lack comprehensive training for law enforcement and others, to intervene in ways which calm the mentally ill person and lead that person to safety and assistance. Too often, a person with a gun is seen as a danger without any sense that the person is struggling with an illness and that the action needs to focus upon getting appropriate assistance for the individual.Hopefully we will see a change in our treatment of the mentally ill. In the meantime, unfortunately, until the public demands effective treatment for mental illness on par with the treatment of other physical illnesses and until we fully fund these needs, we will continue to see these senseless acts of violence directed towards the mentally ill. And the village will continue to be destroyed to save it.

At the same time, other controlled substances, such as alcohol and cigarettes, are either remaining stable or declining in use within the same age group.The war against smoking has been raging on for years. Many anti-smoking campaigns have targeted teens in the hopes that stopping the habit before it starts is the best solution. “Our analysis shows that public health campaigns are working—fewer teens are smoking cigarettes,” said Stephanie Lanza, who is a professor of biobehavioral health and the scientific director of the Methodology Center at Penn State.Unfortunately, Lanza and her team have discovered that teens are not simply stopping when it comes to smoking. They are just replacing cigarettes with marijuana.The researchers collected data from surveys that were given to high school seniors over a 37-year period, from 1976 to 2013. Over 600,000 students were questioned about their use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana. The study used data that was originally collected by the University of Michigan for their own long-term study.The statistical findings showed that, as of 2013, nearly 19 percent of white teens smoked cigarettes and 22 percent used marijuana. These numbers shift slightly for black teens, where only 10 percent smoke cigarettes but nearly 25 percent used marijuana. The researchers also found that teens were more likely to use marijuana if they smoked or drank excessively, and vice versa.When compared to alcohol, though, cigarettes and marijuana still lag behind in teen use. Although these numbers have decreased since the 1970s, alcohol consumption is still more widespread amongst white teens than cigarette or marijuana use. But if abuse trends continue in this manner, then marijuana will likely begin to challenge alcohol consumption as the number one substance that teens abuse.“What will this look like in a few years?” asked Lanza when looking at graphs that showed black teens’ use of marijuana and alcohol consumption. “All signs point to these two lines crossing within the next few years. This is a decisive shift.”Lanza and her colleagues will continue to analyze their data to see what else can be learned from it. They hope to see if the legalization of marijuana in several U.S. states will impact their figures in any significant way. The full study has been published in the Journal of Adolescent Health.  Substance abuse can be pervasive at all ages, but a recent study conducted by researchers at Penn State shows that marijuana use is rising amongst teenagers.

been used for medicinal purposes for more than 4,800 years. Doctors in
ancient China, Greece and Persia used it as a pain reliever and for
gastrointestinal disorders and insomnia.Cannabis as a medicine was common throughout most of the world in the
1800s. It was used as the primary pain reliever until the invention of
aspirin.The United States, in effect, made prescriptions for Cannabis
illegal through the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. The only opponent to the
legislation was the representative of the American Medical Association.Marijuana contains at least 60 chemicals called cannabinoids. THC is the
main component responsible for marijuana's mind-altering effect. Marinol
(dronabinol), a prescription drug taken by oral capsule, is a man-made
version of THCOne of THC's medical uses is for the treatment of nausea. It can improve
mild to moderate nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy and help reduce
nausea and weight loss in people with AIDS.Older people, especially those with no marijuana experience, may not
tolerate THCs mind-altering side effects as well as young people.
Doctors generally prescribe several kinds of newer anti-nausea drugs
with fewer side effects before resorting to Marinol.Glaucoma increases pressure in the eyeball, which can lead to vision
loss. Smoking marijuana reduces pressure in the eyes. Your doctor can
prescribe other medications to treat glaucoma, but these can lose their
effectiveness over time.Researchers are trying to develop new medications based on cannabis to
treat pain. THC may work as well in treating cancer pain as codeine. A
recent study found that cannabinoids significantly reduced pain in
people with multiple sclerosis, a disease of the nervous system.Though some doctors and patients suggest marijuana has a legitimate use,
the federal government disagrees.The law classifies marijuana as one of
the most dangerous drugs that have no recognized medical use. The
penalties for possession of marijuana can range from a small fine to a
prison sentence.Along with the legal implications of smoking marijuana are the health
problems such as memory impairment, loss of coordination and the
potential for withdrawal symptoms and hallucinations. And, inhaling
marijuana smoke exposes you to substances that may cause cancer.One study has indicated that the risk of heart attack more than
quadruples in the first hour after smoking marijuana. The researchers
suggest that a heart attack might be caused by marijuanas effects on
blood pressure, heart rate and the capacity of blood to carry oxygen.Most polls show that about three out of four people approve of medical
marijuana. This has led to the introduction of bills in Congress which
would eliminate federal controls in states which approve medical
marijuana. None of these bills has been voted into law.There is legislation on the books in the majority of states allowing the

The legalization measure was approved on vote of 53 to 47 percent. Amendment 64 permits people in Colorado to possess up to an ounce of marijuana but does not allow them to use it in a public place. It also allows residents to grow up to six marijuana plants in an area not accessible to others.Colorado residents would be able to purchase marijuana at one of the medical marijuana dispensaries that currently require a doctor's prescription.Washington voters also decided to allow recreational marijuana use. The measure allows residents 21 years old or older to purchase up to one ounce from a licensed distributor.In Oregon, a similar ballot initiative failed to get enough votes to pass.There were also some medical marijuana questions on the ballot. In Massachusetts, voters approved a measure to allow marijuana as a medical treatment but a similar proposal failed in Arkansas. In Montana, a proposal to restrict medical marijuana use appeared to have passed.GrowLife, Inc., a company active in the medical marijuana field, says the drug is growing in acceptance.""Marijuana has been shown to be very effective in many different medical scenarios,"" said GrowLife, Inc. CEO Sterling Scott. ""The federal government has long grouped marijuana in the same group as cocaine and heroin, but the reality is that the drug has helped many thousands of people overcome chronic symptoms related to diseases like cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, Crohn's, ALS and Alzheimer's among others.""The Colorado and Washington votes may be the most significant in that they are the first U.S. jurisdictions to decriminalize the recreational use of marijuana. But the new measures face a highly uncertain future.Possession of marijuana is a violation of U.S. law and federal officials have made clear that this statute remains in force, trumping any state initiatives. When Arizona passed its own immigration law the Justice Department sued, with the U.S. Supreme Court overturning portions of the state law. Experts expect the same to happen with the new marijuana laws.In fact, the Justice Department does not recognize the legality of medical marijuana in any state but, to date, has seldom intervened.

                 Read Full Bio→Colorado voters will have a chance to largely decriminalize marijuana when they go to the polls this November.A statewide proposal that would eliminate civil and criminal penalties for limited possession and cultivation of marijuana by adults was certified by the Colorado Secretary of State's office this week, as state officials certified that the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol had collected sufficient signatures from registered voters to qualify the measure for the 2012 ballot.If passed by voters this fall, the measure would immediately allow for the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana and/or the cultivation of up to six cannabis plants by those age 21 and over. Longer-term, the measure seeks to establish regulations governing the commercial production and distribution of marijuana by licensed retailers.While the initiative is said to be popular in Colorado, it's not clear that a similar proposal would fare well nationally.  ConsumerAffairs conducted a computerized sentiment analysis of more than 3.3 million consumer comments on social media and blogs over the last year and found overall sentiment on something of a roller coaster.""Marijuana is safer than a Big Mac,"" tweeted one enthusiast.  ""Marijuana is better than boys,"" said another.  ""William Randolph Hearst is a HUGE reason why marijuana is illegal,"" said an anonymous poster from Oklahoma, offering no historical background for the claim.Quite a few individuals credited marijuana with keeping them sane and motivated. ""I'm thankful for marijuana for giving me piece of mind & good sleep,"" said one.Overall, we found that the primary objection to marijuana is that it's illegal.Of course, the fact that something is illegal doesn't have much to do with whether or not it should be legal, although it's a pretty good argument against using it, at least among those who worry as much about their criminal record as about their credit score.We found only about 140 comments about Colorado's marijuana initiative, too few to be useful. Press reports indicate a notable lack of hysteria about the issue, however.Former state House Majority Leader Paul Weissmann endorsed the initiative, saying the proliferation of medical-marijuana patients and businesses has not damaged the state.""The world hasn't come to an end,"" Weissmann said, according to the Denver Post, which reported that there is so far no organized opposition to the measure.Backers spent more than $200,000 to get the measure on the ballot and are expected to put at least that much into advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts, the Post reported.The initiative does not change existing medical cannabis laws for patients, caregivers, and medical marijuana businesses. The measure also prohibits the imposition of an excise tax on any retail sale of medical marijuana.By contrast, the general assembly would be required to propose ""an excise tax of up to 15 percent on the wholesale sale of non-medical marijuana applied at the point of transfer from the cultivation facility to a retail store or product manufacturer."" This proposed tax must be approved by a majority of voters in a statewide general election before it could be implemented.Non-commercial transfers of cannabis would not be subject to taxation. In other words, you could get high with a little help from your friends without being required to pay tax on the transaction.---Sentiment analysis powered by NetBase Colorado voters will have a chance to largely decriminalize marijuana when they go to the polls this November.A statewide proposal that would eliminate civil and criminal penalties for limited possession and cultivation of marijuana by adults was certified by the Colorado Secretary of State's office this week, as state officials certified that the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol had collected sufficient signatures from registered voters t...By Mark Huffman

Newman, President of the Michigan State Medical Society, and various police officers.Schuette noted confusing inconsistencies between the Michigan Motor Vehicle Code and the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act must be eliminated to preserve safety on Michigan roadways. A longstanding safety provision in the Michigan Motor Vehicle Code prohibits driving with any amount of marijuana in your system.In contrast, the medical marijuana law prohibits only driving ""under the influence of marijuana,"" a term which Schuette says is not defined in state law or by uniform scientific standards, and creates a different standard for medical marijuana users. This inconsistency, he says, has created confusion for law enforcement, and is currently under review by the Michigan Court of Appeals in the case, People v. Koon.Schuette cited statistics recently released by the Michigan State Police which indicate that marijuana-related fatalities remain the most common drug-related automobile fatality, and that such fatalities are on the rise in Michigan.""Driving with marijuana in your system is unsafe and jeopardizes the safety of our roadways,"" said Schuette.  ""If you take drugs, don't take the wheel.""Schuette also proposed legislative reforms to the Penal Code that will give prosecutors and law enforcement the tools they need to crack down on criminals who exploit the loopholes of the medical marijuana law.Schuette has proposed the creation of new crimes to crack down on criminal abuse of the medical marijuana certification system:Schuette says the proposed regulation would also strengthen the hand of law enforcement, limit criminal access to medical marijuana, empower local communities to regulate marijuana facilities, ensure high standards for patient care, and avoid confusion and excessive litigation regarding insurance claims and coverage for medical marijuana users.Schuette said he expects the bills to be introduced and considered by the legislature in the fall.

                 Read Full Bio→The presidential race isn't the only contest on the ballot this fall. In several states voters will consider a number of questions about the status of marijuana, most of which would reduce penalties for its possession.Nine former directors of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are calling on the U.S. Justice Department to actively oppose the initiatives in states where they appear on the ballot.The former officials have signed a letter to US Attorney General Eric Holder urging his office to take active steps to make sure measures that seek to de-penalize the personal use and possession of cannabis by adults do not pass.""We urge you to oppose publicly Amendment 64 in Colorado, Initiative 502 in Washington and Measure 80 in Oregon,"" the letter states. ""To continue to remain silent conveys to the American public ... a tacit acceptance of these dangerous initiatives.""Every former director of the DEA since the agency was founded signed the letter.Amendment 64, the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, Initiative 502, and Measure 80, the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act, all seek to amend state law to allow for the limited possession and distribution of cannabis to adults.According to the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) both Amendment 64 in Colorado and Initiative 502 in Washington hold solid leads among likely voters. Last week, a Survey USA poll of Washington voters showed I-502 ahead by a margin of 57 percent to 34 percent.The DEA letter did not specifically address separate state initiatives in Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Montana that seek to regulate the physician-recommended use and distribution of cannabis.Holder's office previously spoke out in 2010 against Proposition 19 in California after receiving a similar letter from past chiefs of the DEA. That measure sought to allow for the limited possession and cultivation of cannabis for adults. The measure was defeated at the polls by a vote of 46.5 percent to 53.5 percent.State and local moves to lessen penalties for possession and use of small amounts of marijuana puts the states in conflict with the federal government on the issue. Under U.S. law, possession of any amount of marijuana is a misdemeanor punishable by one year in prison and a $1,000 fine. The presidential race isn't the only contest on the ballot this fall.

Meanwhile, as America turns into a legal patchwork quilt where marijuana is safe and legal in some states while remaining a super-dangerous Schedule I drug in others, a couple aspects of the law purely scare the hell out of many observers.The federal government has decreed that, among other things, states with legal marijuana must have systems in place to prevent its being transported to states where it is not legal. But how will this be possible, short of intimately searching every person, package and vehicle exiting a legal-marijuana state? And here’s an even worse thought: given the frequent overzealousness of the anti-drug police, think how ridiculously easy it will be for dishonest people in legal-pot states to utterly destroy the lives of enemies in non-pot states!After all, American anti-drug laws (or, rather, those who enforce them) have long since abandoned the quaint old notion of “innocent until proven guilty”—if there’s any illicit plant matter in your vicinity, cops automatically assume you are, at minimum, Pablo Escobar 2.0.Consider this example (which I mention not because it’s unique but because it’s so depressingly common): One afternoon in 2008, a man named Cheye Calvo, then-mayor of Berwyn Heights, Maryland, returned home from walking his dogs when suddenly, armed SWAT team members broke into his house, shot and killed his dogs, forced him at gunpoint to walk downstairs in his underwear and sit, handcuffed, next to the stiffening corpses of his beloved pets … because somebody sent his wife a package of marijuana via UPS.Neither Calvo nor his wife had any knowledge of the package; authorities later admitted they were victims of a scheme wherein drugs are sent to unknowing recipients and then intercepted along the way.The police, of course, insisted that they did nothing wrong; terrorizing  innocent families and murdering their pets is a small price to pay in exchange for making marijuana slightly more difficult for determined smokers to buy.So here’s the scenario that's scary: Some sociopath with a few bucks to spare thinks “Hmm, as an evil-minded resident of a legal-marijuana state who absolutely despises law-abiding Maryland [or other illegal-marijuana jurisdiction] resident Joe Blow, I think it’s worth spending a few bucks to anonymously mail Joe a couple ounces of weed, then leave an anonymous tip with the anti-drug squad of Joe’s hometown police force....”How realistic are those fears? Conventional wisdom says marijuana makes you paranoid; could changes in marijuana law have the same effect? I posed that question to members of LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition),  a non-profit coalition of current and former police, prosecutors and other law-enforcement professionals who have realized that the War on Drugs isn’t working.LEAP member and former prosecutor Jim Doherty suspects the fear of legal marijuana being used to frame innocent people is, technically, unfounded—though not for the reason you might think.“Because state and federal search & seizure laws do not allow thorough searches of all individuals crossing between states, there is always the possibility that individuals will cross a state border with drugs (legal or illegal) in their possession,” he wrote in an email. “Recreational marijuana that is produced by licensed growers in the State of Washington will be transported to licensed retailers [….] The problem, at least for the next few years, is that unlicensed marijuana is still being produced and sold outside the regulated market. Unlicensed, unregulated marijuana is untaxed, so that product will be cheaper and more prone to cross state borders.”So our hypothetical sociopath won’t frame people with legal marijuana because the illicit variety is cheaper. Still: It’s an undeniable fact that innocent people have been terrorized by police seeking to intercept marijuana mailings. What can be done to protect the Cheye Calvos of the future?LEAP member and former special agent David Long suggested:  “My short answer is that one would hope that prosecutors would utilize their lawful discretion in considering whether to prosecute such cases and that politicians would have the guts to see cases like this as isolated incidents that have nothing to do with the overall enforcement of the legalized marijuana regime.”Yes, well, some prosecutors might use discretion but there is no shortage of politically ambitious prosecutors riding roughshod over individuals, innocent and otherwise.But James Gierach, formerly a prosecutor himself, offered a potentially useful suggestion:  “[H]ow do we prevent an innocent resident of a marijuana prohibition state from being victimized by an enemy or jokester who mails a box of marijuana across state lines, crossing the boundary between legal to illegal?  We need to make it a complete defense to the recipient of the package if the sender uses a false return address on the package.  Then, the insensible will make some sense.”Were such a policy in place five years ago, nobody outside of Berwyn Heights, Maryland would ever have heard of Cheye Calvo, and he wouldn't have had to watch angry SWAT team members shoot his dogs, either. It looks like the beginning of the end for American marijuana prohibition, which has been every bit as successful as 1920s alcohol prohibition while lasting almost ten times as long.Granted, we’re still a long ways away from a time when we can report on the relative quality of various marijuana brands or which shape of waterpipe is best at filtering smoke.

                 Read Full Bio→When it comes to the discussion of drug use in the United States, the conversation can go in about a million different ways all at the same time.First, there are some people in the discussion who tend to put all illegal drugs in the same category, and make the point that the war on drugs doesn’t only need to continue, it needs to be stepped up.Then you have those in the conversation who see a need for a completely new outlook on certain drugs, specifically marijuana, and according to the Pew Research Center, the majority (52%) of U.S. residents believe marijuana should be legal, which is the highest percentage of people sharing that belief in 40 years.As has happened recently with gay marriage, public opinion seems to have reached a ""tipping point,"" and, after years of slow change, now appears to be moving rapidly.The research is providing added ammunition to proponents of legalized marijuana.In fact, it does seem the tide is changing in the favor of those who support legal marijuana use, as there are currently 14 U.S. states that have lowered the penalty for a person carrying small amounts.In Rhode Island, for example, officials have decriminalized amounts that seem to be for personal use, so someone carrying less than an ounce of marijuana will be subject to a $150 ticket with no jail time.John G. Edwards, a Rhode Island state representative, feels that decriminalizing small amounts of pot is a move towards a sensible solution to the nation’s drug problem.“I am very proud that Rhode Island will be able to begin a new chapter in sensible drug policy today,” said Edwards in a press conference.“As I have said many times before, I firmly believe that people should be able to work, volunteer and live their lives after being caught for a youthful indiscretion or two. What we have been able to do with this law is effectively punish those in possession of small quantities of marijuana while giving people opportunities to redeem themselves by allowing them to be productive members of society.”And as far as teen marijuana use is concerned, Sen. Josh Mille of Rhode Island—like other state officials on his side of the argument—says proper education instead of throwing kids in jail may be the right move to get them to stop or at least remove the forbidden fruit aspects of smoking the controversial green stuff.“It’s clear from what we’ve been able to glean from the Special Senate Commission to study the prohibition of marijuana that education and treatment are better for addressing teen marijuana use than incarceration,” he said.“We’re also saving money by keeping people out of jail for minor marijuana infractions and putting money where it can best serve our communities: drug education programs for young violators.”However, a bill in Hawaii over the decriminalization of marijuana didn’t go quite the same way. State lawmakers there defeated a bill that would have followed in the footsteps of places like Rhode Island.Those concerned about decriminalizing pot in the Aloha State, like former Congressman Patrick Kennedy, say lightening marijuana laws will only increase people’s dependence on it.“Hawaii’s rates of marijuana use are significantly higher than in the rest of the country,” said Kennedy, chairman of SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana), an organization that considers itself bipartisan in the marijuana debate.SAM wants the U.S. to shift towards laws that will neither criminalize low-level users, nor create policies that will increase people’s dependence on marijuana.“Fewer kids in Hawaii think smoking marijuana is harmful compared to kids in the United States as a whole,"" added Kennedy. ""I have seen firsthand the debilitating effects of marijuana addiction. It’s more than just the addict, it’s the families who suffer too.”Advocates of legalizing marijuana note that the Pew Research survey does not support Kennedy's position.Obviously the debate on marijuana use will continue, as more states are tweaking some of their laws, some aren’t changing them at all, and others like New Hampshire are considering legal recreational use, so the conversation is likely to go in a million more places before all is said and done.In Vermont, Attorney General Bill Sorrel said he’s in favor of the decriminalization of marijuana, and says it’ll lower those crimes that are attached to people seeking out dealers.  Sorrel even said he’s in favor of Vermont residents growing their own marijuana plants for the same reason.“This might be a surprise to some,” he said in a hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee.“But the reality is possession of small amounts of marijuana has in effect been decriminalized for quite some time in this state. If you take away the ability to grow your own, you’re pushing someone who wants to possess and use marijuana into the marketplace of having to deal with marijuana dealers. And is that the behavior you essentially want to require and foster?”It’ll be interesting to see where the nation is on marijuana laws at the close of this year. It’s likely that states as well as public opinion will be split for a long time to come. When it comes to the discussion of drug use in the United States, the conversation can go in about a million different ways all at the same time.First, there are some people in the discussion who tend to put all illegal drugs in the same category, and make the point that the war on drugs doesn’t only need to continue, it needs to be stepped up.Then you have those in the conversation who see a need for a completely new outlook on certain drugs, specifically marijua...By James R.

                 Read Full Bio→Advocates of legalizing marijuana have been saying for years that it's the safest recreational drug of all, and now a study suggests that that's actually an understatement.Marijuana is even safer than everyone thought it was while alcohol is even more dangerous, according to the study, published in Scientific American.  Looking at what it takes to ingest a lethal dose, the researchers found that alcohol was 114 times more dangerous than THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. The study compared the estimated lethal dose of a number of drugs to the estimated human intake. Using this approach, alcohol, nicotine, cocaine and heroin fell into the ""high risk"" category, with alcohol having by far the highest risk profile.This perhaps comes as good news in Alaska, where a ballot measure to legalize and regulate marijuana for adults takes effect tomorrow (Tuesday). Alaskans age 21 and older will legally be able to possess up to one ounce of marijuana and cultivate no more than six plants at home, though commercial sales will have to wait until regulations have been established.Colorado, Oregon and Washington have also legalized marijuana, and medical marijuana is permitted in 23 states and Washington D.C.“We anxiously await the same public safety improvements from Alaska that we have already seen in Colorado and Washington,” said Maj. Neill Franklin (Ret.), executive director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP). “Cops will spend more time going after dangerous criminals and protecting communities, and parents can rest assured that their local marijuana retailer is barred from selling to their children.”Legalization efforts continue in Congress, where Representatives Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) introduced separate bills to tax and regulate the sale of marijuana for adults at the federal level. The measure is seen as having little chance of winning passage in the Republican-controlled Congress.  Advocates of legalizing marijuana have been saying for years that it's the safest recreational drug of all, and now a study suggests that that's actually an understatement.Marijuana is even safer than everyone thought it was while alcohol is even more dangerous, according to the study, published in Scientific American.  Looking at what it takes to ingest a lethal dose, the researchers found that alcohol was 114 times more dangerous than THC, the active...By Christopher Maynard

                 Read Full Bio→The debate over the legalization of marijuana has continued to rage on as states begin to adopt more lenient legislation on the matter. Proponents point out that there are numerous economic and health benefits that come along with legalizing the drug, but there are bound to be negative consequences as well.One study shows that the chances of young children swallowing, breathing in, or otherwise being exposed to marijuana has increased dramatically as policies shift in its favor.The numbers that have been uncovered by the study are truly staggering. From 2006 to 2013, exposure to marijuana for children five years of age or younger has risen 147.5% across the U.S. This number is small potatoes when compared to states that legalized marijuana for medical purposes. In these states, the rate increased almost 610% in the same time period.States that legalized marijuana from 2000 to 2013 have had child exposure rates increase steadily. There is roughly a 16% increase each year, and there is always a more dramatic jump in the year that marijuana was legalized in each state.But it is not just states that legalize marijuana that have to worry. Even states that had not legalized marijuana by 2013 saw a rise of 63% in marijuana exposure in young children from 2000 to 2013.But why exactly is this exposure to young children occurring? Henry Spiller, who co-authored the study and is the director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children’s, explains why children may be attracted to the drug.""The high percentage of ingestions may be related to the popularity of marijuana brownies, cookies and other foods,"" he says. ""Very young children explore their environments by putting items in their mouths, and foods such as brownies and cookies are attractive.""Exposure to marijuana has produced a range of results when it comes to children. While most instances resulted in minor clinical effects, some children suffered from coma, decreased breathing, or seizures. These more serious conditions could be due to increased amounts of THC in marijuana food products.  Gary Smith, who is the senior author of the study and the director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s, urges that states need to have child protection laws in place when it comes to marijuana. Although the total number of exposure cases is less than 2,000, he believes that the growing trend in states that have legalized marijuana is very telling.""Any state considering marijuana legalization needs to include child protections in its laws from the very beginning,"" Dr. Smith said. ""Child safety must be part of the discussion when a state is considering legalization of marijuana,"" he said.Other researchers endorse the idea that marijuana be treated like other chemicals and medicines in a household. If marijuana products are being kept in the house, they should be kept out of sight of children. If possible, they can be locked in a cabinet to ensure that they cannot be swallowed by mistake.The full study was published in Clinical Pediatrics on June 8, 2015.

It's not always true but in the case of marijuana, it just may be that sticking to the real thing is safer than using synthetic substitutes, popularly known as ""spice"" and ""K2."" (Using none at all is OK too, of course).A University of South Florida neurology team reports that stroke may be among the severe health hazards associated with synthetic marijuana.An advance online article in the journal Neurology  details case studies by the USF neurologists of two healthy, young siblings who experienced acute ischemic strokes soon after smoking the street drug spice.  Ischemic strokes occur when an artery to the brain is blocked.Seizures, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, psychosis, hallucinations and other serious adverse effects have been associated with smoking synthetic pot.  Medical journals have also begun to report a growing number of strokes potentially related to the use of natural (non-synthetic) marijuana.“Since the two patients were siblings, we wondered whether they might have any undiagnosed genetic conditions that predisposed them to strokes at a young age. We rigorously looked for those and didn’t come up with anything,” said senior author W. Scott Burgin, MD, professor of neurology at the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine and director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Tampa General Hospital.“To the best of our knowledge, what appeared to be heart-derived strokes occurred in two people with otherwise healthy hearts.  So more study is needed.”USF vascular neurology fellow Melissa Freeman, MD, was lead author of the paper.Synthetic marijuana refers to a mixture of herbs, often resembling lawn clippings, that have been sprayed or soaked with a solution of designer chemicals intended to produce a high similar to cannabis when consumed.  Spice can be much more potent than conventional marijuana because of the more complete way the psychoactive ingredient in the synthetic product binds to the brain’s cannabinoid receptors, Dr. Burgin said.People who smoke spice expose their brains to unidentified chemicals untested on humans.“You don’t know what you’re getting when you smoke synthetic marijuana,” Dr. Burgin said. “It’s like the Wild West of pharmaceuticals, and you may be playing dangerously with your brain and your health.”Not identified in standard toxicology screens, spice has become second only to natural marijuana as the most widely used illicit drug among high school seniors, according to a 2011 survey sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.More physicians need to be more aware of the potentially toxic effects of recreational synthetic drugs, especially when seeing conditions like heart attack or stroke not as common in young patients, Dr. Burgin said. “Be willing to ask about pot and spice use, because it’s not something patients are inclined to volunteer and synthetic marijuana does not show up on routine drug tests.” There's a popular belief that anything that's ""natural"" is better than anything that's not.

District residents pay taxes to the United States but have no Congressional representation and their elected city council's actions can be overturned by Congress for any or no reason. That's why D.C. license plates have the slogan “Taxation without Representation.”The House Appropriations Committee put out a three-page press summary (available in .pdf form here) including three paragraphs dedicated to the District of Columbia. The first paragraphs mention the size of next year's federal payment to D.C. ($680 million) and offers a partial breakdown of how that money's been earmarked ($479 million for “public safety and security costs” including “DC Courts” and “supervision of offenders and defendants.” The second paragraph discusses money spent for schools and other educational costs in D.C. And the third paragraph says this:In addition, the legislation maintains a longstanding provision prohibiting federal and local funds from being used for abortion in the District of Columbia, and prohibits both federal and local funds from being used to implement a referendum legalizing recreational marijuana use in the District.In the actual spending bill, which is 1,603 pages long, this paragraph is on page 660:None of the funds contained in this act may be used to enact or carry out any law, rule or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution of any schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act or any tetrhydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes.In other contexts, various members of Congress and especially the House Appropriations Committee have surely said nice things in favor of democracy, voting, the Will of the People and other things mentioned in civics textbooks.Yesterday, various protesters (incuding members of D.C.'s city council) gathered in the city's downtown. Some of them were specifically protesting the marijuana issue, others the larger issue of D.C. self-rule (basically, demanding that residents of the district have the same voting rights as any other American citizens, including the right to vote on local issues rather than have Congress manage their local affairs for them).NBC's Washington blog reported late last night that the “marijuana protesters” (some of whom were protesting not in favor of legal marijuana, so much as the larger issue of self-rule for D.C. residents) joined up with another group demonstrating against police brutality against ordinary citizens.Rep. Andy Harris (R-Maryland), who firmly opposes marijuana legalization, led the behind-the-scenes strategy to overturn election results in D.C. He told Politico magazine that if D.C. residents don't like Congressional oversight, they should live somewhere else: “That’s the way the Constitution was written …. If they don’t like that oversight, move outside of the federal district to one of the 50 states that is not covered by the jurisdiction of Congress as a whole.”Of course, in America as a whole, a slight majority of polled voters now support marijuana legalization, which is why some political analysts predict the Republicans' short-term victory in successfully overriding the will of D.C. voters will hurt them on the national stage in the long run. For now, Congressional oversight of Washington, D.C. will continue to ignore the wishes of the majority of voters in D.C. and the rest of the country, at least where marijuana laws are concerned. On Election Day last month, voters in Washington, D.C. chose by a margin of more than 2-1 to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes.A month later, Congress decided to overturn those election results. District residents pay taxes to the United States but have no Congressional representation and their elected city council's actions can be overturned by Congress for any or no reason. That's why D.C. license plates have the slogan “Taxation without Representatio...By Jennifer AbelFuture historians will be able to build entire specialized careers out of parsing the contradictory American laws regarding marijuana in the second decade of the 21st century.At the federal level, marijuana is still officially classified as a Schedule 1 drug — meaning that there is absolutely zero medicinal benefit, according to federal regulators. (However, while genuine marijuana officially has no medical use, artificial marijuana in the form of the prescription drug Marinol does.)So that's the federal view of marijuana, but at the state level things change depending on where you live: marijuana is legal for recreational purposes in Colorado and Washington State, legal via prescription for medicinal purposes in 20 states and the District of Columbia, and a medically worthless felony-offense drug everywhere else (as of presstime).But in those states where marijuana is less than completely illegal, there's a new legal wrinkle to consider: as an op-ed writer for Food Safety Newswondered, “What About Marijuana Food Safety?” and noted: “A considerable paradox exists in U.S. food policy. Although the federal government has named food safety as a top priority, an entire pocket of the food industry remains largely unregulated by, or at least largely under the radar of, most federal agencies. That pocket is marijuana-infused food.”Here's the problem: for the most part, food safety is overseen by the feds (though states do have the option of adding additional regulations if they wish). Meanwhile, where marijuana at the state level is concerned, the federal government has a sort of “don't ask, don't tell” policy in place: still completely illegal at the federal level, but if a state government chooses to take a different view, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other anti-marijuana federal agencies more or less ignore it.So — for those who view marijuana as something to eat rather than something to smoke — what policies are the feds implementing to ensure the marijuana-food supply is safe? Thus far, the answer appears to be “no policy at all.”The Coloradoannoted on Feb. 6 that in Colorado, ever since retail marijuana sales became legal on Jan. 1, foods infused with marijuana have gained in popularity among people who want to enjoy the effects of marijuana without subjecting themselves to clouds of pungent (okay, stinky) pot smoke.But the only safety issues mentioned in that article are those involving people who confuse marijuana-infused treats with ordinary ones — say, mistaking a marijuana brownie for a regular non-intoxicating chocolate treat. And what state-level rules have been or will be implemented focus mainly on how potent a given batch of marijuana is — an entirely different matter from, say, making sure a given crop is free of E. coli or other contaminants.We suspect that when future historians write their doctoral dissertations on the evolution of American marijuana laws, they will note that federal food-safety standards did not apply to marijuana crops until after the feds abandoned their “Schedule 1” insistence and officially treated marijuana as akin to alcohol—taxed and regulated far more strictly than ordinary consumer consumables, in some places available only through a state-run monopoly, but completely legal for any adult to possess or ingest. Future historians will be able to build entire specialized careers out of parsing the contradictory American laws regarding marijuana in the second decade of the 21st century.At the federal level, marijuana is still officially classified as a Schedule 1 drug — meaning that there is absolutely zero medicinal benefit, according to federal regulators.

Meanwhile, heroin use was fairly stable throughout the decade. Methamphetamine consumption dramatically increased during the first half of the decade and then declined.Citing 2012 statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 8.9% of people in the U.S., age 12 or older, had used an illicit drug in the past month. A large percentage of them reported using marijuana.""Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,"" said Beau Kilmer, the study's lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. ""This work synthesizes information from many sources to present the best estimates to date for illicit drug consumption and spending in the United States.""The report's data stops at 2010 so researchers say it does not cover the recent spike in heroin use, or take into consideration the consequences of marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington.The study provides estimates of the amount of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine used each year from 2000 to 2010. It includes estimates of retail spending on illicit drugs and the number of chronic users, who researchers say account for a majority of drug consumption.Besides the money consumers spend on illegal drugs, billions more is spent trying to prevent those purchases and treating the effects of drug abuse. The Drug Policy Alliance reports the U.S. spends $51 billion a year on the war on drugs. In 2012 1.55 million people in the U.S. were arrested on nonviolent drug charges.In 2012 749,825 people in the U.S. were arrested for violating marijuana laws – 88% of them for possession. The number of Americans incarcerated in 2012 in federal, state and local prisons and jails rose to 2.2 million, or one in every 108 adults, the highest incarceration rate in the world.The National Institute on Drug Abuse keeps track of the costs of substance abuse. By its accounting the abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs is costly, amounting to over $600 billion annually in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and healthcare.It says the health care costs related to illicit drug use is $11 billion a year. Drug use overall, it says, costs $193 billion. Compared to alcohol, which is legal, the health care costs are $30 billion and overall costs $235 billion.The large uptick in marijuana use appears to be related to an increase in the number of people described as heavy users, who reported using the drug on a daily or near-daily basis. Those estimates are based on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which surveys nearly 70,000 people each year.Estimates for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine are largely based on information from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, or ADAM, which was recently defunded by the U.S. government.

Your day or the next couple of days are ruined.”Palm Springs officials say they're concerned mainly with ensuring that the products sold by local dispensaries are safe.“Right now, we’re just taking baby steps,” said Jay Thompson, Palm Springs chief of staff who’s coordinating the pilot program. “Hopefully, as we get down the line, we can develop standards, but right now we’re just doing it for patient safety and for patient information.”There are no state regulations covering marijuana in California and the federal government still regards it as illegal so for the time being, it's up to cities to oversee the quality of the local weed. Wurzer testing is necessary if marijuana is to grow out of its current cottage-industry status.“For everyone involved, it would just be easier if there were set rules,” he said, according to the Sentinel. “Vague rules allowed the industry to innovate and find itself. Now is the time that we know what we’re getting into and what we need for rules and regulation.” Now that marijuana is sort of legal in some cities and states, there's growing pressure on local regulators to make sure the stuff that's being sold is safe and that its potency is clearly indicated on the packaging.Trying to stay ahead of the curve, the desert resort city of Palm Springs, California, next week begins testing the marijuana sold in local dispensaries, according to local media reports.The tests will be conducted by SC Labs of Santa Cruz, Calif., which alr...Terms of Use Your use of this site constitutes acceptance of the Terms of Use.

A study on drug trends from the year 2000 to 2010 found dramatic shifts in the consumption of illicit drugs. The study by the RAND Corporation found cocaine use fell by half from 2006 to 2010, while marijuana use increased by 30 percent over the same period. (Via Flickr / Torben Bjørn Hansen)The same study found the U.S. spent an estimated $109 billion on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine consumption in 2010. That's more than was spent at either furniture or electronics and appliance stores.
HealthDay notes while the yearly amount spent on drugs stayed pretty consistent over the decade-long study, ""spending patterns for certain drugs shifted. Much more was spent on cocaine than on marijuana in 2000, but that had reversed by 2010.""While those are some pretty staggering numbers, Businessweek notes there is a ""great deal of uncertainty"" in the study, and the figures could be off by huge amounts.It points out while the best estimate for spending on cocaine in 2010 is $28 billion, the possible range is anywhere from $18 billion to $44 billion.""No one's scanning a bar code when they hand over a bag of coke, and criminal enterprises don't fill out economic data surveys.""​Still, the study's lead author said in a press release the research is ""critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations.""​That press release acknowledges the study doesn't take into account the recent reported spike in heroin use or the effect of the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington. The full report was published on the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy website.Want more news?

HealthDay Reporter
MONDAY, March 10, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Americans' use of cocaine fell by half from 2006 to 2010, but marijuana use increased by more than 30 percent during that time, according to a new report.The spike in pot use may be due to an increase in the number of people who said they use the drug on a daily or near-daily basis, said the researchers, whose study covered drug trends from 2000 to 2010.
Heroin use remained fairly stable during the decade, while methamphetamine use rose sharply during the first half of the decade and then fell.Americans spent $100 billion a year on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine -- or a total of $1 trillion over the decade, the RAND Drug Policy Research Center report estimated.""Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,"" study lead author Beau Kilmer, co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center, said in a RAND news release.While the overall amount spent per year on drugs remained the same from 2000 to 2010, spending patterns for certain drugs shifted. Much more was spent on cocaine than on marijuana in 2000, but that had reversed by 2010.Because the report did not examine trends after 2010, it doesn't include recent reported increases in heroin use, or the effects of marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington. The report also didn't look at the reasons behind changes in drug use and did not assess the effectiveness of drug-control strategies.The report was prepared for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and appears on its website.Prescription and over-the-counter medications.Know when to seek medical attention.Changes that happen in the body and the mind.Causes, symptoms, and treatment.© 2005 - 2018 WebMD LLC.

426	"03.11.2014LifeShare this PostThe marijuana industry in the U.S. is ramping up and the legalization movement for the plant seems to have reached a tipping point. Washington and Colorado have already legalized the drug in a small way and other states appear to be following. Views on the drug are also changing and even the President has declared marijuana less dangerous than other, legal, drugs.With all of this momentum for the marijuana movement, the critics who declared the plant a gateway drug might expect to see the use of harder drugs also increasing. This is not the case, at least with cocaine.A new study published on the Office of National Drug Control Policy website this week shows that cocaine use in the U.S. dropped by around 50% from 2006 to 2010. This while marijuana consumption increased by more than 30% during the same period. The report's authors were not able to gather enough data to estimate methamphetamine use past 2008. Likewise, the more recent spike in heroin overdoses is not included in the report.The report, compiled by RAND Corporation, also includes U.S. spending estimates for various illegal drugs. It estimates that Americans bought upwards of $100 billion worth of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine yearly - around $1 trillion spent during the first decade of the 21st century.""Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,"" said Beau Kilmer, lead author of the report and co-director of the Drug Policy Research Center at RAND.

It is such an important data system for understanding drug problems.”Maybe not. It all depends on how you define “drug problem.”These sort of surveys also tend to reinforce the beliefs of those who create them. In this case, drugs are illegal, so you ask criminals about their drug habits. All you need to know, right?I’ll leave the other drugs out as largely irrelevant to our discussion here and focus on marijuana.Most people who commit the “crime” of using marijuana never commit any other crime — period. In fact, asking only criminals about marijuana is a lot like asking child molesters about their parenting practices. You may get some interesting data, but it really doesn’t reflect how our society raises children.Of course, if the intent is to paint every marijuana user as a hardened criminal, to make the assertion that using marijuana leads to crime, or any of a number of other silly prohibitionist myths that have little or no basis, then using the survey data is good propaganda — it’s just not very good scholarship.Totally agree.  I think the only trend that is obvious here is that more people are less afraid to be given the stink eye for admitting they are ganja smokersJust a thought…when asked about cannabis use more people will answer honestly now that it’s legal, at least in many places but blow is still against the law.The study seems to cut-off data at 2010, before cannabis was legal anywhere.Maybe part of the reason behind the demise of the study was that they specifically did not want to know the answer to the question, “What happens after legalization?” That rather clashes with the study design of asking only those in contact with the legal system about their drug use.

428	"(HealthDay News) — Americans' use of cocaine fell by half from 2006–2010, but marijuana use increased by more than 30% during that time, according to a new report. The spike in pot use may be due to an increase in the number of people who said they use the drug on a daily or near-daily basis, said the researchers, whose study covered drug trends from 2000–2010. Heroin use remained fairly stable during the decade, while methamphetamine use rose sharply during the first half of the decade and then fell.Americans spent $100 billion a year on cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine – or a total of $1 trillion over the decade, the RAND Drug Policy Research Center report estimated. While the overall amount spent per year on drugs remained the same from 2000–2010, spending patterns for certain drugs shifted. Much more was spent on cocaine than on marijuana in 2000, but that had reversed by 2010.Because the report did not examine trends after 2010, it doesn't include recent reported increases in heroin use, or the effects of marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington. The report also didn't look at the reasons behind changes in drug use and did not assess the effectiveness of drug-control strategies.""Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,"" study lead author Beau Kilmer, PhD, co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center, said in a RAND news release.Full Article

429	"A study has found that use of cocaine among Americans has dropped by over 50%. The statistics over the last half decade have revealed that smoking Marijuana has become a new trend in America, with 30% more Americans now smoking pots. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy has received the new report. Researchers at the RAND Drug Policy Research Center have compiled the stats. ""Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations"", said Beau Kilmer, the study's lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center.He said in a recent new release that their report was aimed at providing the best estimate of illicit drug consumption to date and how much is being spent on drugs for pleasure in the US.Most of the data for compiling the report was collected between 2006 and 2010. Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, or ADAM, provided significant help to derive cocaine usage estimates. Marijuana use, on the other hand, was derived from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.The new analysis failed to figure out recent effects of marijuana legalization in Washington and Colorado because the report was based on studies and surveys till 2010.Researchers are of the belief that it would become difficult in future to do such analysis as the Federal Government has defunded valuable ADAM program last year. A vital role was played by the ADAM program to provide important details on who abused hard drugs and how much they spent on these substances, said Jonathan Caulkins, co-author of the new study public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University. It was really tragic to realize that 2013 was the last year for ADAM, he said.Life is becoming busier than ever and the food...A truck driver, who is on trial for an accident...A container ship sailing around 500km north of New...When tragedies like Orlando shooting incident...Shares of Baidu dropped five percent during the...On Tuesday, Crude oil futures dropped during early..."

I’ve invested more than 30 thousand hours investigating this one subject.And what I’ve found sickens me. It compels me to reject with my very being the concept of a Drug War. It is a scam, a feckless, endless, mindless pursuit of global success and salvation. It’s been more than 40 years since President Nixon declared the war on drugs to “Go after the blacks without appearing to do so”.It is now over 50 years since the United Nations declared their war on drugs with the belief that they would eliminate drugs from planet Earth within 5 years. Barbarous drug cartels worldwide love this situation. It makes them billions of dollars per year.Cocaine was made a federal offense when politicians proclaimed that black men on Cocaine would rape white women, or at a minimum would fail to step off the sidewalk when a white man approached.In 1937, because Mexicans were taking our jobs and they “might” rape white women while high on Marijuana, the feds crafted the Marijuana Tax Act which was later declared unconstitutional in Leary vs. U.S., then put under the regimen of the ludicrously named Controlled Substances Act.Over the lifetime of the Drug War, more than 45 million non-violent US citizens—have been arrested for these plant products in their pocket. The US has invested over 1 Trillion dollars trying to stop the flow of these drugs. And at the same time, drug users worldwide have invested 10 Trillion dollars in purchasing these drugs. These barbarous cartels, the terrorists and the thousands of U.S. gangs make 400 Billion dollars a year from this policy.So what have we wrought? What benefits? What positives have we derived from maintaining this policy? And what are we likely to derive if we continue this forever? Most politicians are so ignorant as to avoid this question at any cost, but when I spoke with former President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, I asked him “Is there anything positive that we derive from this Drug War?” and he said, “Nothing, there is no benefit”, he closed his thought with, ”prohibition doesn’t work”.Belief in the Drug War allows ignorance to be used as a badge. And to hell with the Constitution. Belief in Drug War encourages feigned hysteria and overblown fears which are now being used as a bludgeon.Before prohibition of these drugs, a gram of pure Cocaine could be bought at the drug store for twenty-five cents. Now, the youngsters out there are buying a contaminated, often polluted, gram of Cocaine that could go over one hundred dollars per gram. Prior to the Drug War, a month’s supply of Heroin could be purchased from Sears Roebuck for a dollar and they would throw in a syringe as a bonus as well.Back in 1900, 1 and ½ percent of us were addicted. Today after all this hoopla, 1 and ½ percent of us are addicted.After forty years, fifty years, more than a hundred years of Drug War, it’s time to face facts. The Drug War is a pipe dream of men who have long since died. It has become a quasi-religion, a belief system that attracted many adherents within law enforcement and the criminal justice system to speak from ignorance, bigotry and steadfastly in support of primitive creeds, platitudes and irrational tradition.Those who make their bones from this policy—and by God the cemetery is overflowing from their efforts—cannot now back down from their prior pronouncements. They dare not jeopardize their reputation, their legacy; by now embracing the truth that the Drug War is vacuous, hollow and a horrendous mistake. Until we face this truth, these cheerleaders for Drug War, these Drug War addicts, will continue their eternal chant, their everlasting rain dance in the eye of this Drug War hurricane.The answer to the Drug War? Legalize. Stop funding the Taliban. Gut the cartels. Eliminate most of the gangs. Let Pfizer produce it and let Walgreen sell it. We’ll judge adults by their actions like it used to be, instead of by the contents of the baggies in their pocket. We’ll then have lots of room in prison for anybody who would dare sell drugs to our children.I am not for gradual change to the drug laws quoting Martin Luther King Jr., “Gradualism is so often an excuse for Escapism and Do Nothingism, which ends up in Standstillism”.The Drug War is an abomination and it must be ended.To End The War On Drugs features the thoughts of 115 experts on the subject of drug war.  Included are the words of scientists, doctors, judges, cops, wardens, prosecutors, politicians, authors, prisoners, patients, pastors, pot providers and more.340 pages of unvarnished truth that will help bring about an end to the madness of this irrational, unscientific and plain fucking evil war on drugs.Paperback On sale at CreateSpace/Amazon Kindle Digital Version Website: Features link to first two chapters & Index of expertsContact: dean@drugtruth.netGet a copy, share it with friends and family.

This book rips the head off the drug war.Wow Dean! Nice work, as usual.Neurotics build castles in the sky, psychotics live in them; the concept of a “Drug-Free Society” is a neurotic fantasy, and Prohibition’s ills are a product of this psychotic delusion.In a dangerous and futile attempt to stamp out alcohol, tobacco, heroin, marijuana, pornography, prostitution, marital infidelity, and even masturbation, this former land of the prosperous and free has been shamelessly pillaged by groups such as the Women’s Christian Temperance Society, The Anti-Saloon League, The Anti-Cigarette Movement, The Social Purity Movement, The Social Hygiene Movement, and now our latter day Drug Warriors.Prohibition was flawlessly designed to increase drug use, atomize society, impoverish citizens, spread illness, increase unemployment, destroy lives, imprison productive people, subvert democracy, shred the Constitution, empower the ignorant & brutal, facilitate mass surveillance, destroy the educational system, hold people in ignorance, manipulate and censor the media, and enrich a tiny puritanical minority of mega-millionaires and corporate bosses. Sadly, it has succeeded in all these objectives.If you support prohibition, then you’re a black market profiteer, a terrorist, a corrupt politician, a sadomoralist, a nanny-state socialist, or a fake-conservative.Finally, the truth about the drug war is emerging! In addition to supplying a scapegoat for fascist thugs and the marching morons who cheer them, drug illegalization is about money.The major drugs in the world — alcohol, cannabis, opiates, and cocaine — are valuable medicines which have served mankind for hundreds of years. Medicinal plants and extracts are also the safest drugs. Preparations of alcohol, cannabis, opium, and coca have been safely produced and consumed for centuries. These much-valued herbal medicines also have religeous, ceremonial, and recreational uses. They belong in every home and medicine kit unless the homeowner chooses otherwise.Medicinal plants and extracts are currently illegal because they cannot be patented. They are illegal because they can be produced and sold for pennies by poor people such as peasant farmers. They are illegal because the biological action of every prescription drug can be duplicated with medicinal plants, extracts, and dietary supplements that are much safer, more effective, and much cheaper. In a free market where everyone, including poor people, are allowed to compete, basic medicines (drugs) would be dirt cheap. Big Pharma (the government licensed drug cartel) would lose more than ninety percent of their sales amounting to several hundred billion dollars per year. That is the reason why government drug fighters are employed to arrest millions of consumers who prefer natural drugs and choose not to be ripped off by Big Pharma. Money is the reason why government thugs are employed to murder peasant farmers and spray poison on their land, livestock, crops, and families. In fact, the medical industrial complex purchases tons of opiates every year from selected peasant farmers and resell them by prescription for more than a thousand times what they paid. The prescription drug racket is the most profitable racket in history enforced by armies of police and a vast prison complex.The drug war is now a one trillion dollar per year armed robbery that enriches Big Pharma and the police-prison industrial complex at the expense of taxpayers and consumers. It is the largest armed robbery in history.↑	Health
431	What are the trends of illicit drug use in the United States over the past five years? According to a new report submitted to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, snorting lines of cocaine is down while smoking joints is up in the nation!The report compiled by researchers at the RAND Drug Policy Research Center found that between 2006 and 2010, cocaine use has dropped dramatically while that of marijuana has spiked considerably during the period.“Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,” disclosed Beau Kilmer, the study’s lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. “This work synthesizes information from many sources to present the best estimates to date for illicit drug consumption and spending in the United States.”Study detailsIn order to get an insight into the number of ‘chronic users’ and how much Americans spend on drugs, experts scrutinized data on illegal drug use from numerous national studies conducted between 2000 to 2010. Data on marijuana use was mostly pulled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health while that for the cocaine, methamphetamine comes from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM).The analysis revealed between 2006 and 2010 cocaine use was cut in half across the nation but that of marijuana jumped a whopping 30 percent in the same period. In contrast, heroin abuse has remained fairly stable over the past 10 years whereas consumption of methamphetamine has declined after seeing a sharp rise at the first half of the decade.Americans shelled out more than $100 billion for marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin annually throughout the decade. According to experts, the sum of money spent yearly on illicit drugs remained consistent during the study period, but the drugs the money was spent on saw a difference.“Our analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than $1 trillion on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,” said Beau Kilmer.

432	"How many Americans have an alcohol abuse disorder? Statistics can be gleaned from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and other sources about the prevalence of alcohol use, alcohol use disorders, underage drinking, alcohol-related conditions, and fatalities.It is not possible to determine the number of alcoholics in the United States because there is no official diagnosis of ""alcoholism."" Since the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in May 2013, drinking problems have been diagnosed as alcohol abuse disorders, ranging in level from mild to moderate to severe. Even before then, in the DSM-IV, published in 1994, alcohol use disorders were broken down into two categories: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. Among people 18 years or older, an estimated 86.4 percent reported they had consumed alcohol at some point during their lives; 70.1 percent said they had a drink within the past 12 months and 56.0 percent said they drank alcohol within the past 30 days.An approximate 26.9 percent of all adults in the U.S. reported engaging in binge drinking in the past 30 days and 7.0 percent admitted to heavy drinking in the past month. For the NSDUH survey, binge drinking was defined as five or more drinking on the same occasion on at least one day in the past 30 days. Heavy drinking was defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion on five or more days in the past 30 days.An estimated 6.2 percent of adults over 18—about 15.1 million people—had an alcohol use disorder. This included 9.8 million men and 5.3 million women, or 8.4 percent of all adult men and 4.2 percent of all adult women.Of the people with a drinking problem, only 6.7 percent received professional treatment for their alcohol use disorder in the past year from a facility specializing in alcohol treatment and rehabilitation.Breaking it down further, only 7.4 percent of men and 5.4 percent of women who needed help for an alcohol problem actually sought help for that problem.The prevalence of heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorders are highest among men aged 18 to 24, and men who are unemployed.Several studies have found that binge drinking was most common among non-Hispanics whites, those with some college education, and those with an annual family income $75,000 or more. In contrast, alcohol use disorders were most common among American Indians or Alaskan Natives, those having less than a high school education, and those with an annual family income of less than $25,000.Among youth ages 12 to 17, an estimated 623,000 had alcohol use disorders, including 325,000 females and 298,000 males. Among U.S. adolescents, 2.5 percent had already developed an alcohol use disorder. During the previous 12 months, only 5.2 percent of those with a drinking problem received treatment in a rehab facility.Each year, an estimated 88,000 people—62,000 men and 26,000 women—die from alcohol-related causes. This makes alcohol abuse the third leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. In 2014, there were 9,967 deaths attributed to alcohol-impaired driving.A CDC report from 2014 said that, among 15-year-old Americans, 35.1 percent reported having had at least one drink and about 22.7 percent reported drinking within the past 30 days. That included 23 percent of males and 22.5 percent of females.Among those from age 12 to age 20, 14.2 percent—about 5.4 million—reported binge drinking. That includes 15.8 percent of males and 12.4 percent of females. Approximately 3.7 percent of this age group—about 1.4 million—reported heavy drinking, including 4.6 percent of males and 2.7 percent of females.Among U.S. college students, 58.4 percent of full-time students ages 18 to 22 reported drinking alcohol in the past 30 days, compared to 50.6 percent of others the same age. An estimated 39 percent of college students reported binge drinking in the past month and 12.7 percent admitted to heavy drinking. All of these percentages are significantly higher for the same age group among non-college students.Sources:Alcohol Facts and Statistics. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

	The use of cocaine dropped sharply across the United States from 2006 to 2010, while the amount of marijuana consumed increased significantly during the same period, according to a new report.
	Studying illegal drug use nationally from 2000 to 2010, researchers found the amount of marijuana consumed by Americans increased by more than 30 percent from 2006 to 2010, while cocaine consumption fell by about half. Meanwhile, heroin use was fairly stable throughout the decade.
	Methamphetamine consumption dramatically increased during the first half of the decade and then declined, but researchers did not have enough information to make a credible estimate of the drug's use from 2008 to 2010.
	The findings come from a report compiled for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy by researchers affiliated with the RAND Drug Policy Research Center.
	""Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,"" said Beau Kilmer, the study's lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. ""This work synthesizes information from many sources to present the best estimates to date for illicit drug consumption and spending in the United States.""
	Because the project only generated estimates through 2010, researchers say the report does not address the recent reported spike in heroin use or the consequences of marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington. The report also does not try to explain the causes behind changes in drug use or evaluate the effectiveness of drug control strategies.
	The study, published on the website of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, provides estimates of the amount of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine used each year from 2000 to 2010. The study includes estimates of retail spending on illicit drugs and the number of chronic users, who account for a majority of drug consumption.
	Researchers say that drug users in the United States spent on the order of $100 billion annually on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine throughout the decade. While the amount remained stable from 2000 to 2010, the spending shifted. While much more was spent on cocaine than on marijuana in 2000, the opposite was true by 2010.
	""Our analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than one trillion dollars on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,"" Kilmer said.
	The surge in marijuana use appears to be related to an increase in the number of people who reported using the drug on a daily or near-daily basis.
	The estimates for marijuana are rooted in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which surveys nearly 70,000 individuals each year. Estimates for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine are largely based on information from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, or ADAM. The final estimates also incorporated information from other data sources
	However, since the federal government recently halted funding for ADAM, researchers say it will be considerably harder to track the abuse of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine in the future.
	""The ADAM program provided unique insights about those who abused hard drugs and how much they spent on these substances,"" said Jonathan Caulkins, a study co-author and the Stever Professor of Operations Research and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. ""It's a tragedy that 2013 was the last year for ADAM. It is such an important data system for understanding drug problems.""
	To improve future estimates, the report recommends investments in programs like ADAM that collect detailed data from heavy users. It also recommends that federal agencies revise some of the questions on existing self-report surveys.RAND CorporationPosted in: Medical Research News | Healthcare NewsTags: Drug Abuse, Drugs, Heroin, ResearchCancel reply to commentCharles Mazel, PhDAn interview with Charles Mazel, President of NIGHTSEA, conducted by Barbara Foster, The Microscopy & Imaging Place, Inc.Dr. Rajat MukherjeeData science is a marriage between statistical science and informatics, using statistical principals of math and logic on huge volumes of data.Dr. Thomas MuellerDr. Thomas Mueller is the Director of Product Management in the AFM business unit of Bruker’s Nano Surfaces Division.

434	"According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), about 620,000 Americans used heroin in 2010. But according to a new report commissioned by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, something like 1.5 million Americans were ""chronic heroin users"" that year. That group includes anyone who has consumed heroin on four or more days in the previous month.This dramatic discrepancy results from the report's attempt to count heroin users missed by NSDUH, whether because they did not respond honestly, because they did not respond at all, or because they were not part of the household population sampled by the survey. To adjust for such undercounting, Beau Kilmer and eight other drug policy analysts at the RAND Corporation rely mainly on data from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM), which includes urinalysis as well as a survey. Because it focuses on arrestees, ADAM is more likely than NSDUH to identify heavy drug users. But its sample, unlike NSDUH's, is not nationally representative, so Kilmer and his colleagues must perform a series of calculations to convert ADAM numbers into total male arrestees testing postive for heroin and divide those users by frequency of use. Then they add estimates for men who were not arrested as well as for women and teenagers, based partly on NSDUH and information about overdoses, emergency room episodes, and treatment admissions.The RAND researchers convert their estimate of heroin users into estimates of total consumption and spending. They use similar methods to estimate the size of the cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana markets. In the case of marijuana, a drug for which NSDUH seems to be a better guide, Kilmer et al. rely mainly on numbers from that survey, inflated by 25 percent and supplemented by ADAM data for respondents with criminal records. It is an impressive, headache-inducing feat, but one that is subject to ""great uncertainty"" because of the assumptions involved and the limits of the data, as the authors repeatedly acknowledge. ""In many cases,"" they say, ""the extent of the uncertainty cannot be bounded or quantified."" They do not really know, for example, ""the extent to which one can trust arrestees' self-reports about their spending on illegal drugs"" or ""how to extrapolate just ten urban areas' arrest records to the country as a whole.""The RAND estimate for frequent heroin users is much higher than the one reported by NSDUH. In a recent USA Today op-ed piece, Kilmer and one of his collaborators, Jonathan Caulkins, say ""estimates from the 2010 NSDUH suggest there were only about 60,000 daily and near daily heroin users""—i.e., people who used heroin on 21 or more days in the previous month. They argue that ""the real number is closer to 1 million.""
Yet whether you look at NSDUH data or at the RAND estimates, the trend from 2000 through 2010 looks similar. ""Heroin consumption remained fairly stable throughout the decade,"" Kilmer et al. write, ""although there is some evidence of an increase in the later years."" They note that ""there was a steady increase in the amount of heroin seized within the United States and at the southwest border from 2007 through 2010,"" but they caution that seizure levels may reflect enforcement efforts and traffickers' tactics rather than consumption. The RAND estimates of heroin consumption indicate ""essentially no change"" from 2000 to 2010. The report does not cover the two subsequent years, when NSDUH reported an increase in the number of past-month heroin users, from 239,000 in 2010 to 335,000 in 2012.(Image Wikipedia)The trends for the other drugs are also similar to what the NSDUH data suggest. ""Multiple indicators are consistent with an increasing trend in meth consumption over the first half of the decade and a subsequent decline through 2008,"" Kilmer et al. write. ""From 2002 to 2010, the amount of marijuana consumed in the United States likely increased by about 40 percent while the amount of cocaine consumed in the United States decreased by about 50 percent."" Throughout the period covered by the report, estimated annual spending on the four drugs in the United States totaled about $100 billion, although the breakdown changed substantially. ""In 2000,"" say the RAND researchers, ""much more money was spent on cocaine than marijuana; in 2010 the opposite was true.""[cross-posted at Hit & Run]"	Health

          16View  commentsUppers are down and downers are up, according to a new report on American drug use. Between 2006 and 2010, use of cocaine in the U.S. has dropped by half while marijuana use has increased an astonishing 30 per cent. Use of heroin on the other hand has remained fairly stable, while methamphetamine use has been on the decrease since seeing a huge spike at the beginning of the decade. Change of habit: Between 2006 and 2010, cocaine use in the U.S. dropped by half The new report was published by the White House's Office of National Drug Policy which is affiliated with the RAND Drug Policy Research Center and draws on data between 2000 and 2010. Each year, the National Drug Policy office totals how much Americans spend on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and meth while also estimating the number of chronic users. 'Our analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than one trillion dollars on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,' said Beau Kilmer, the study's lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Police Research Center. That's an average of $100billion a year. The report does not attempt to explain changes in drug use or the impact of drug control strategies. However, the dramatic increase in marijuana use may be attributed to the fact that there was an increase in people who reported daily or near-daily use of weed in recent years. New vice: Meanwhile, marijuana use went up 30 per cent and may be attributed to more users using the substance on a daily or near-daily basis Data on marijuana use was mostly taken from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health while statistics on the other three drugs comes from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM). Federal funding for ADAM was halted this year, which may mean less-reliable data in the future.

436	"Studying illegal drug use nationally from 2000 to 2010, researchers found the amount of marijuana consumed by Americans increased by more than 30 percent from 2006 to 2010, while cocaine consumption fell by about half. Meanwhile, heroin use was fairly stable throughout the decade. Methamphetamine consumption dramatically increased during the first half of the decade and then declined, but researchers did not have enough information to make a credible estimate of the drug’s use from 2008 to 2010. The findings come from a report compiled for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy by researchers affiliated with the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. “Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,” said Beau Kilmer, the study’s lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. “This work synthesizes information from many sources to present the best estimates to date for illicit drug consumption and spending in the United States.” Because the project only generated estimates through 2010, researchers say the report does not address the recent reported spike in heroin use or the consequences of marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington. The report also does not try to explain the causes behind changes in drug use or evaluate the effectiveness of drug control strategies. The study, published on the website of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, provides estimates of the amount of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine used each year from 2000 to 2010. The study includes estimates of retail spending on illicit drugs and the number of chronic users, who account for a majority of drug consumption. Researchers say that drug users in the United States spent on the order of $100 billion annually on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine throughout the decade. While the amount remained stable from 2000 to 2010, the spending shifted. While much more was spent on cocaine than on marijuana in 2000, the opposite was true by 2010. “Our analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than one trillion dollars on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,” Kilmer said. The surge in marijuana use appears to be related to an increase in the number of people who reported using the drug on a daily or near-daily basis. The estimates for marijuana are rooted in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which surveys nearly 70,000 individuals each year. Estimates for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine are largely based on information from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, or ADAM. The final estimates also incorporated information from other data sources However, since the federal government recently halted funding for ADAM, researchers say it will be considerably harder to track the abuse of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine in the future. “The ADAM program provided unique insights about those who abused hard drugs and how much they spent on these substances,” said Jonathan Caulkins, a study co-author and the Stever Professor of Operations Research and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. “It’s a tragedy that 2013 was the last year for ADAM. It is such an important data system for understanding drug problems.” To improve future estimates, the report recommends investments in programs like ADAM that collect detailed data from heavy users. It also recommends that federal agencies revise some of the questions on existing self-report surveys.

Americans are using less cocaine and more marijuana than before, according to new data on illegal US drug use.Pulling from numerous national studies, data on illegal drug use were collected nationwide from 2000 to 2010 as part of a study done for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Between 2006-2010, cocaine use was cut in half across the US, while the same time period revealed a 30 percent increase in marijuana use.Heroin use remained stable throughout the decade, the study found. Consumption of methamphetamine rose sharply during the first half of the decade before declining, but end-of-decade data on meth-use was not solid enough for researchers to make definitive statement on the overall trend for the decade.Throughout the decade, Americans spent $100 billion on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine every year, according to the study, which is published on the Office of National Drug Control Policy's website. While the sum of money spent annually on illegal drugs stayed the same throughout the decade, the drugs the money was spent on changed, the researchers found.""Our analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than $1 trillion on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,"" said lead study author Beau Kilmer, co-director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center.

Because the study only ran through 2010, researchers said Colorado and Washington state's recent legalization of marijuana for recreational use was not factored in, nor was a recent spike in heroin use.Still, the data will be valuable for policy makers, drug treatment centers and researchers, the study authors said.""Having credible estimates of the number of heavy drug users and how much they spend is critical for evaluating policies, making decisions about treatment funding and understanding the drug revenues going to criminal organizations,"" Kilmer said. ""This work synthesizes information from many sources to present the best estimates to date for illicit drug consumption and spending in the United States.""The researchers said that similar and more accurate studies in the future will be more difficult now that the government has canceled the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM).

438	"Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.Americas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.Americas+1 212 318 2000EMEA+44 20 7330 7500Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000America’s illegal drug market is huge. The country spent $109 billion in 2010 on illicit marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin, according to new (and very rough) estimates from the RAND Corp. prepared for the White House.To put that number in perspective: It’s more than we spend at furniture stores ($90 billion) or electronics and appliance retailers ($101 billion) annually, according to U.S. Census data. It’s more than one-fifth of what we spend eating out each year, and it dwarfs the $21 billion we drop at bars.Most of that $109 billion is spent by what the RAND report calls “the minority of heavy users,” who get high during at least 21 days of a month. And while the total dollars spent (adjusted for inflation) remained roughly stable from 2000 to 2010, the mix has changed. Cocaine use has gone down; marijuana use has gone up. Meth peaked in the middle of the Aughts, though the report’s authors caution that the meth numbers are less reliable than other estimates.There’s a great deal of uncertainty in RAND’s numbers. No one’s scanning a bar code when they hand over a bag of coke, and criminal enterprises don’t fill out economic data surveys. The researchers tried to size up the drug market by extrapolating from user demand, rather than create estimates based on drugs seized by law enforcement. The uncertainty “is an inevitable consequence of trying to measure sales of something sold in hidden markets or consumption behavior that is both illegal and dominated by a relatively small number of heavy users,” the report says.The numbers may be off by huge amounts. For example, while RAND’s best estimate of U.S. spending on cocaine (including crack) in 2010 is $28 billion, it pegs the range as $18 billion to $44 billion. Even the upper and lower bounds don’t necessarily capture all the uncertainty in measuring drug spending. RAND says “the range should be considered plausible, but not extreme.”That said, the numbers show the direction of shifting drug habits, even if the estimates are far from precise. In 2000, Americans spent more than twice as much on cocaine than on cannabis. That changed dramatically by 2010, when marijuana spending was estimated to be almost 50 percent higher than cocaine. (The first three years of marijuana data are not perfectly comparable to the rest of the series because of survey changes, Rand notes.)

#lazy-img-243496422:before{padding-top:75.78125%;}

Marijuana had far more regular users than the other drugs in Rand’s analysis, and the figure appeared to jump toward the end of the decade. (Note that the study period ends two years before Colorado and Washington State approved legal recreational pot use.)

#lazy-img-243496434:before{padding-top:64.84375%;}

And here are the estimates for the amount of each drug traded, by weight. Again, the decline in cocaine and rise in marijuana are clear:

#lazy-img-243496444:before{padding-top:83.8258164852255%;}

RAND’s study period ends in 2010, several years before resurgent heroin use began making headlines, most recently after Philip Seymour Hoffman’s death. But the report may record the early signs of a growing problem: “Heroin consumption remained fairly stable throughout the decade,” the authors note, “although there is some evidence of an increase in the later years.”"	Health
439	"Exaggerated health claims are not convincing the public, and ""medical"" marijuana has become something of a running cultural joke, but there is an upside to more pot - less cocaine use. Meth too, according to advocates at the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. Or at least a group is correlating the two. Methamphetamine and cocaine consumption increased during the first half of the last decade and then dropped in the latter half. Marijuana use increased significantly during that time, according to a new report.Studying illegal drug use nationally from 2000 to 2010, researchers found the amount of marijuana consumed by Americans increased by more than 30 percent from 2006 to 2010, while cocaine consumption fell by about half.

440	"SectionsSocialInformationsections According to the Associated Press, ""the White House needs something close to a miracle to meet its goal of enrolling 6 million people by the end of this month."" (AP File Photo)The Department of  Health and Human Services said more than 940,000  people signed up during  February for private coverage under President  Barack Obama's health  care law, bringing total sign-ups to 4.2 million.With open  enrollment ending March 31, that means to meet the goal,  another 1.8  million people would have to sign up during the month, an  average of  about 60,000 a day.That's way above the daily averages for  January and February, which  have ranged between 33,000 and 34,000. The  math seems to be going  against the administration.If the target  isn't met, the immediate fallout will be political.  Republicans will say  it proves their point that Obama's signature  project never had the  public's support. Backers of the law will have to  work harder to smooth  out some of its problems and convince Americans  to take a second look.Administration  officials expect the pace to pick up as  procrastinators are forced to  act. There are no plans to extend the  March 31 deadline, they emphasize.  The big question is whether that  will be enough to make up for the  technical troubles that paralyzed  HealthCare.gov much of last fall and  the continuing challenges for  several state-sponsored websites.""Given  what we know about past enrollment patterns for health care,  we expect  that even more (people) will sign up as we approach the March  31  deadline,"" said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.Julie  Bataille, communications director for the health care rollout,  said she  expects millions more to sign up — but she wouldn't commit to  a number  by March 31.The goal of 6 million sign-ups is itself a lower bar  than was  originally set. The Congressional Budget Office scaled back its   original target of 7 million because of the federal website's computer   problems. HealthCare.gov serves 36 states, while 14 states and   Washington, D.C., are running their own sites.The 943,000 enrolled in February fell short of the target of 1.27 million that HHS had initially set for the month.And the cumulative total of 4.2 million sign-ups is just  three-fourths of the 5.65 million that HHS originally projected would  sign up by the end of February. Those estimates are from a Sept. 5, 2013  departmental memo.The  numbers released Tuesday still don't say how many of those  signing up  were previously uninsured, which is the ultimate test of  Obama's health  care overhaul.And they don't say how many consumers have sealed the deal by paying their premiums.Health care industry consultant Robert Laszewski said that undercuts his confidence in the numbers.""They are still reporting numbers that are inflated,"" he said.Separately,  a Gallup survey released Monday found that the share of  Americans  without health insurance has been going down so far this  year, albeit  modestly.Enrolling for health care under Obama's law is still  nowhere near as  simple as shopping online. Bataille said consumers make  an average of  six visits to HealthCare.gov, spending 20 to 30 minutes  per visit.Among the highlights of Tuesday's federal report:—  Young adults seemed to be showing a little more interest in  signing up.  Of those signing up in February, 27 percent were between  the ages of  18-34. Their premiums are needed to help defray the cost of  caring for  older generations. Independent analysts have said the mix  should be 40  percent young adults.But people 55-64 are the leading age group among those signing up, cumulatively accounting for 30 percent of total enrollment.—More  than four out of five who have enrolled thus far were eligible  for tax  credits to help offset the cost of premiums, and in some cases  also to  reduce their deductibles and copayments.—Sixty-three percent of those signing up picked a mid-range silver plan.—Fifty-five  percent of those signing up are women, and 45 percent  are men.  ""Enrollment among women remains particularly strong,"" Sebelius  said.An  AP analysis of state-by-state enrollment numbers showed that 13  states  are running ahead of their enrollment targets. Virginia, with a  new  Democratic governor who supports the health care law, was the  latest  addition to that list. Six of the top-performing states are led  by  Republican governors: Florida, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, North  Carolina,  and Wisconsin.Some states that have run into trouble have reduced their enrollment  goals. But based on the original HHS enrollment targets, the five at the  bottom are Massachusetts, Washington, D.C, Oregon, New Mexico, and  Nevada.__Associated Press writer Kevin Vineys contributed to this report. View the discussion thread.Copyright 1998-2018 CNSNews.com.The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where truth and liberty flourish.

Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 1:15 pmWASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration said Tuesday it's making steady progress on health care sign-ups, but the White House needs something close to a miracle to meet its goal of enrolling 6 million people by the end of this month.It could happen with a sustained surge in consumer demand and a foolproof website. But they're not seeing it yet, and time is running out.The Department of Health and Human Services said more than 940,000 people signed up during February for private coverage under President Barack Obama's health care law, bringing total sign-ups to 4.2 million.But with open enrollment ending March 31, that means to meet the goal, another 1.8 million people would have to sign up by the end of the month, an average of about 60,000 a day.That's way above the daily averages for January and February, which have ranged between 33,000 and 34,000. The math seems to be going against the administration.Officials expect the pace to pick up. The big question is whether it will be enough to make up for the technical troubles that paralyzed HealthCare.gov much of last fall and the continuing challenges for several state-sponsored websites.The goal of 6 million sign-ups is itself a lower bar than was originally set. The Congressional Budget Office scaled back its original target of 7 million because of the federal website's computer problems. HealthCare.gov serves 36 states, while 14 states and Washington, D.C., are running their own sites.The 943,000 enrolled in February fell short of the target of 1.27 million that HHS had initially set for the month.And the cumulative total of 4.2 million sign-ups is just three-fourths of the 5.65 million that HHS originally projected would sign up by the end of February. Those estimates were contained in a Sept. 5, 2013 departmental memo to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.The numbers released Tuesday still don't say how many of those signing up were previously uninsured, which is the ultimate test of Obama's health care overhaul. And they don't say how many consumers have sealed the deal by paying their premiums.Separately, a Gallup survey released Monday found that the share of Americans without health insurance has been going down so far this year, albeit modestly.Among the highlights of Tuesday's federal report:— Young adults seemed to be showing a little more interest in signing up. Of those signing up in February, 27 percent were between the ages of 18-34. Their premiums are needed to help defray the cost of caring for older generations. Cumulatively, people ages 55-64 are the leading group among those signing up, accounting for 30 percent of total enrollment.—More than four out of five who have enrolled thus far were eligible for tax credits to help offset the cost of premiums, and in some cases also to reduce their deductibles and copayments.—Fifty-five percent of those signing up are women, and 45 percent are men.An AP analysis of state-by-state enrollment numbers showed that 13 states are running ahead of their enrollment targets. Virginia, with a new Democratic governor who supports the health care law, was the latest addition to that list. Six of the top-performing states are led by Republican governors: Florida, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.Some states that have run into trouble have reduced their enrollment goals. But based on the original HHS enrollment targets, the five at the bottom are Massachusetts, Washington, D.C, Oregon, New Mexico, and Nevada.__Associated Press writer Kevin Vineys contributed to this report.This question has been bandied about over the years, most often when the U.S. Armed Forces have failed to meet recruiting goals and start offering all sorts of incentives to get young people to sign on. On the plus side, we wouldn't have a shortage of military personnel. On the down side, we'd have quite a few recruits who are not suited for military service (one of the problems critics have with the continued lowering of standards for acceptance into the armed forces.) And with so many forced to serve, how would that affect morale? On the other hand, many Americans — especially those who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam — believe that military service would do a world of good for the nation by whipping into shape what many see as a generation of entitled, infantilized young people.

448	"Political notebookWASHINGTON — The Obama administration said Tuesday that 943,000 people signed up last month for private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, increasing the number of those who have selected health plans since Oct. 1 to more than 4.2 million.The number of people picking plans was smaller in February than in December or January. But administration officials predicted a surge of applications toward the end of this month, just before the open enrollment period ends.Of those who have signed up to date, the administration said, about 25 percent were ages 18 to 34, the same proportion as in the first four months of the open enrollment period, through January.Insurers and the White House have avidly sought young adults, saying their premium payments were needed to offset the costs of coverage for Americans who were older and presumably sicker.The latest figures were released as the White House makes a final push to increase enrollment, which got off to a slow start because of the technical problems that crippled the federal insurance marketplace in October. Less than three weeks remain before the March 31 deadline for consumers to sign up.Of the people who have signed up so far, the administration said, 2.6 million were in the federal insurance marketplace, and 1.6 million were in states running their own exchanges.“Over 4.2 million Americans have signed up for affordable plans through the marketplace,” said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. “Now, during this final month of open enrollment, our message to the American people is this: You still have time to get covered, but you’ll want to sign up today.”The age profile of people signing up is somewhat older than insurers had expected. The number of people age 55 to 64 — 1.3 million — exceeds the number in the 18-to-34 age bracket, 1.1 million.Insurers say that roughly one in five people who signed up for coverage failed to pay their January premiums. And some of those who paid and received services in January failed to pay premiums for February, putting their coverage at risk.More than four-fifths of those choosing health plans to date — 83 percent — qualified for financial assistance to help pay their premiums, administration officials said.People who go without insurance after March 31 may be subject to tax penalties. The Internal Revenue Service can deduct the penalties from any refunds to which taxpayers may be entitled.

Obama takes a turn ‘Between Two Ferns’

WASHINGTON — President Obama is hamming it up online to promote his health care plan.Obama joked Tuesday with comedian Zach Galifianakis, including poking fun at the poorly reviewed ‘‘The Hangover Part III’’ during an interview on the website Funny or Die.Galifianakis typically poses awkward questions to celebrity guests appearing on ‘‘Between Two Ferns,’’ and Obama was no exception. After being asked how it felt to be ‘‘the last black president’’ and about the false notion that he was born in Kenya, the president pitched sign-ups for health care by the March 31 deadline.Obama’s appearance is part of an effort to reach young Americans crucial to the program’s success.Asked whether he’d want a third term — which is barred by the Constitution — Obama said, ‘‘If I ran again it would be sort of like doing a third ‘Hangover’ movie. It didn’t really work out very well, did it?’’Galifianakis is a star of the ‘‘Hangover’’ franchise.—

Senate OK’s bill backing pediatric medical research

WASHINGTON — The Senate Tuesday passed Republican-backed legislation to repeal taxpayer funding for political conventions and to go on record in support of devoting $126 million over the coming decade for additional research into pediatric cancer and other childhood disorders like autism and Down syndrome.The measure was passed by unanimous voice vote at the request of minority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. It now goes to President Obama for his signature. The House passed the measure late last year.The legislation was named after Gabriella Miller, a Virginia girl who died of brain cancer last year at age 10. She had helped raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and also sought to win public support for pediatric cancer research.‘‘One courageous young girl, Gabriella Miller, inspired bipartisan action to help research, treat, and cure pediatric diseases and disorders,’’ said majority leader Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia and a key House sponsor of the measure. “When people would remark that Gabriella was wise beyond her years, she would tell them that having a brain tumor means you have to grow up real fast.’’Majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada said the measure is largely symbolic and doesn’t directly fund additional pediatric research; the actual funding would come in future appropriations bills. Funding for medical research through the National Institutes of Health has been squeezed in recent years under tight spending limits and automatic spending cuts.

466	"CHICAGO — Nearly 900 Illinois residents per day signed up for coverage on the health insurance marketplace last month, but the state must quicken that pace to reach a goal set by President Barack Obama's administration.
Federal figures released Tuesday show 113,733 Illinois residents signed up for coverage during the first five months of the nation's new marketplace system.
""February was a busy and productive month and we are working hard to build on it the next three weeks,"" said Jennifer Koehler, executive director of Get Covered Illinois, the state's marketplace. The state is working closely with hundreds of groups in communities across Illinois to assist people in the enrollment process, she said.
Nationally, total sign-ups reached 4.2 million, according to the figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services. The administration hasn't said how many of those people were previously uninsured or how many have paid their premiums.
Illinois' tally through the end of February fell just short of the original five-month goal of 114,400 for the state, an estimate contained in a Sept. 5, 2013 departmental memo to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. That report also set a target of 143,000 Illinois enrollees by March 31.
Illinois would have to sign up 944 people per day in March to achieve that overall goal.
One-third of the Illinoisans signing up for coverage are older, ages 55 to 64, a group more likely to have expensive medical needs than younger people. The most popular plans are the so-called silver plans, with 56 percent of Illinois enrollees choosing them over other plans.
The health care law requires nearly every American to have insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty of either $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is higher.
Time is running out for people who want to buy private health insurance and avoid the penalty. March 15 is the deadline to sign up for coverage that begins on April 1. The open enrollment period closes March 31.
Those who miss the March 31 deadline will have another opportunity to sign up for coverage in November; that coverage would start in January 2015.
Medicaid coverage is available any time during the year to those who qualify — people with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level ($16,104 for an individual).
The Obama administration said Tuesday it's making steady progress on health care sign-ups, but the White House needs something close to a miracle to meet its goal of enrolling 6 million people by the end of this month.
It could happen with a sustained surge in consumer demand and a foolproof website. But they're not seeing it yet, and time is running out.

467	"If you listen to the President, and other supporters of Obamacare, you might get the impression that the reason why tens of millions of Americans go without health insurance is because these people have pre-existing conditions, and health insurers are too mean to cover them. The truth is quite different. Less than a million Americans lack health insurance because of a pre-existing condition. And it turns out that a good number of Americans are uninsured not because they are sick, but because they are convicted criminals.When Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that half of the law’s expansion of health insurance coverage would come from expanding Medicaid, America’s government-run health insurance program for the poor. However, in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states could decline to expand their Medicaid programs; thus far, 25 states have held off. As the debate continues in those holdout states, one data point has gotten almost no attention.It turns out that more than a third of the U.S. population eligible for the Medicaid expansion are ex-cons. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice estimated that “at least 35 percent of new Medicaid eligibles under the Affordable Care Act will have a history of criminal involvement.”
They arrived at this number by noting that approximately 10 million Americans are either in jail or released from prison each year; if approximately 60 percent of these individuals are uninsured enrollees in the appropriate income range, and the Medicaid expansion was originally estimated to cover 16 million people, then more than 35 percent of the Medicaid expansion population is comprised of convicted criminals.Yesterday, in a front-page story in the New York Times, Erica Goode described the impact of Medicaid on the prison population. Medicaid’s “most important benefit,” according to corrections officials, “is that inmates who are enrolled in Medicaid while in jail or prison can have coverage after they get out. People coming out of jail or prison have disproportionately high rates of chronic diseases, especially mental illness and addictive disorders…many would qualify for Medicaid” under Obamacare’s expansion of the program.Defenders of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion argue that it’s a good thing that ex-convicts can get Medicaid coverage, because it might help them stay out of jail. “If they go off their medication, oftentimes it can once again lead to more criminal activity,” asserted Rick Raemisch, executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, to Erica Goode.Real-world data to assess this hypothesis is mixed, but it’s a hypothesis that can’t be dismissed out of hand. It’s certainly true that policy reformers of all stripes should give some thought as to how best to prevent ex-cons from returning to crime.But Medicaid is an especially expensive, and inefficient, and ineffective program rife with waste, fraud, and abuse. You can be sure that there are plenty of taxpayers who work hard and play by the rules, who are wondering why they should pay more in taxes for this purpose. It's certainly not what they were told they were paying for when Obamacare was passed.*    *    *READ AVIK’S NEW BOOK, How Medicaid Fails the Poor (Encounter, 2013), available at Amazon and other major retailers.

High 42F. Winds light and variable..A clear sky. Low 28F. Winds light and variable. Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 1:15 pmThe Democrats in the General Assembly have taken hostages. And, one of those hostages is you.The plan to take over health care in the United States has two parts. First, establish control of private medical insurance, deciding who gets covered for what, and second, greatly increasing the number of people who receive government paid medical coverage from Medicaid. A key component of Obamacare is Medicaid expansion.Twenty-four states have rejected Medicaid expansion, while twenty-three states have accepted it, and three states are dithering. The states that have rejected Medicaid expansion are the Republican states of the South, Mid-West and Rocky Mountains. The states that have accepted it are the Democratic states of the Northeast, Southwest and West Coast.Medicaid is a program that now consumes 21 percent of Virginia’s budget. Also, it is well known as a program that is full of waste and fraud.Now, back to your being taken hostage. The Democrats in the General Assembly sponsored bills in the State Senate and the House of Delegates to bring Medicaid expansion to Virginia. When the Delegates in the House voted on expansion, it was overwhelmingly defeated. Sounds pretty straight forward. That’s where the story should have ended.However, the State Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, then came up with an alternate plan. It added Medicaid expansion to the budget. The tactic of putting a stinker in the budget is how Washington operates.Some explanation may be helpful. In Washington, thousands of Federal programs would never be passed by Congress if those programs were put up to an individual vote. If the multitude of outrageous programs were placed before the House of Representatives and the US Senate, they would be knocked down just like the targets in a shooting gallery.In Washington, the smart guys in power have figured a way around that. They place their stinkers in the budget. When the budget comes up for a vote, the argument is, “If we don’t pass the budget, schools will close, police will be laid off, social security checks won’t be mailed, etc. You have all heard that song before. Well, now they will be singing that song in Richmond.The name of the song is “We Must Pass the Budget or the Government Will Shut Down.” It will be sung by the Democratic Chorus, with back-up singers from the Press. The political opera will be fully funded by the lobbyists who represent big corporations.The stand-off in Richmond will be unlike anything Virginia has ever witnessed. You will be held hostage as the Democrats attempt to pass Medicaid expansion using the budget. Now the question is: Will the Republicans in the House of Delegates muster the courage to rescue you? Or, will they surrender like the Republicans in Washington?How does it feel to be a hostage?Ken Adams is the Chairman of the Waynesboro Republican Committee.This question has been bandied about over the years, most often when the U.S. Armed Forces have failed to meet recruiting goals and start offering all sorts of incentives to get young people to sign on. On the plus side, we wouldn't have a shortage of military personnel. On the down side, we'd have quite a few recruits who are not suited for military service (one of the problems critics have with the continued lowering of standards for acceptance into the armed forces.) And with so many forced to serve, how would that affect morale? On the other hand, many Americans — especially those who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam — believe that military service would do a world of good for the nation by whipping into shape what many see as a generation of entitled, infantilized young people. What do you think? "	Health

I just came across what looks like a conspiracy to commit 'welfare fraud' and I can’t wait to alert the ranking Republican in the Maine Legislature. I just came across what looks like a conspiracy to commit “welfare fraud” and I can’t wait to alert the ranking Republican in the Maine Legislature.Oh, wait. It’s his idea.“Making a conscious commitment to bring yourself above the poverty line allows you to receive these subsidies – with no penalty for falling short of that goal of improving your own economic future and working your way out of poverty,” wrote Senate Minority Leader Michael Thibodeau, R-Winterport, in a recent op-ed in the Kennebec Journal.Translation: If you live below 100 percent of the federal poverty line and thus are ineligible for health-care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, you need only nudge up your “projected” income for next year to just above the cutoff – and you’re in!Asks Thibodeau, “Is it too much to ask of anyone receiving benefits to commit to improving their own economic future?”Well, senator, if you’re suggesting that people deliberately lie about what they’ll make next year to sneak in under the federal health insurance umbrella, then yes, it is too much to ask.In fact, it flies in the face of this statement at the bottom of the Affordable Care Act application (just above where the applicant affixes his or her signature): “I’m signing this application under penalty of perjury, which means I’ve provided true answers to all the questions on this form to the best of my knowledge. I know that I may be subject to penalties under federal law if I intentionally provide false or untrue information.”Thibodeau’s winking and nodding is part of a broader strategy by Maine Republicans in recent weeks to use the Affordable Care Act (long the source of all evil in their world) as proof that there’s no need to expand Medicaid, known here as MaineCare, to about 70,000 low-income Mainers who now have no affordable access to health care.Roughly half of those 70,000 folks have earnings between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty line. That would make them eligible for Medicaid if they lived in a state with expanded coverage. In the absence of expanded Medicaid, they qualify for subsidies in the new federal health insurance marketplace.Whether such private-sector coverage is actually attainable for that group, however, depends on how easily (or not) they can shoehorn the extra costs into their already bare-bones monthly budgets. The heavily subsidized premiums – as low as $5 per week – may sound attractive, but the out-of-pocket deductibles and co-pays can run well into the hundreds if not thousands of dollars.Meanwhile, for the 36,000 or so Mainers below the poverty line – $11,490 per year for a single-person household – that federal marketplace is plainly and simply off limits.Why? Because the Affordable Care Act assumes that those people simply can’t afford private insurance – with or without subsidies – and thus should be covered through expanded Medicaid programs.Which brings us to the Catch-22: Maine is one of 21 states that have flat-out refused to expand Medicaid.And try as our Democrat-controlled Legislature might to muster a veto-proof majority to change that, MaineCare expansion is fast morphing from a moral imperative into an election-year political bludgeon. (Note to Republican lawmakers laying down in front of MaineCare expansion: Come November, you might be surprised to find how many of your constituents think it was a really bad idea to thumb your noses at $1 million per day in federal health-care subsidies for the next three years.)This latest move, though, is politics at its absolute worst. By now dangling the Affordable Care Act in front of the lowest-income Mainers, Thibodeau & Co. have turned the clinical (Who doesn’t need to see a doctor now and then?) into the cynical (Pay no attention to that perjury warning! You’re improving your economic future!).Appearing Monday on the Maine Public Broadcasting Network’s “Maine Calling” program, Jake Grindle, a health services navigator for Western Maine Community Action in East Wilton, called Thibodeau’s op-ed “very concerning, very dangerous advice.”“If you know that you make less than the federal poverty level and you intentionally provide false or misrepresenting information on that application, there are civil and criminal penalties,” said Grindle. “You sign that application under penalty of perjury. I can’t say strongly enough to people, ‘Don’t lie on your application.’ ”Karen Turgeon, a program director for 211 Maine who oversees health insurance marketplace navigation for the Portland-based Opportunity Alliance, wholeheartedly agrees.In fact, Turgeon said, if you vault yourself over the 100 percent poverty line based on wishful thinking alone, there’s a pretty good chance it will come back and bite you.“The problem is that when people go to file their taxes, if they projected incorrectly, then they’re going to have to pay that money back,” said Turgeon. “If you’ve miscalculated what your income would be, then the subsidy that you’ve received is inaccurate and you would ultimately owe money.”That might happen right away. According to Grindle, some people who claim they’ll be crossing the 100 percent poverty line for the first time will be asked, as the year goes on, to provide documentation that they’re keeping up with their projections.Or it might come a few years down the road. While there’s plenty of online speculation that the feds will never catch up with (or crack down on) poor people who tell a white lie to get their foot in the door to a doctor’s office, Turgeon said it might take several years for the other shoe to drop.Bottom line, Turgeon said, “We would not encourage somebody to fudge what their income is. Our goal is not to put people into a situation that could become an issue for them later.”That brings us back to Thibodeau, who’d be screaming to high heaven about all those welfare cheats if this hare-brained scheme didn’t dovetail so nicely with his (and Gov. Paul LePage’s) anti-MaineCare mantra.“Individuals who can ‘anticipate’ their incomes will exceed the federal poverty level are eligible for a subsidy through the exchanges based on their anticipated income,” wrote Thibodeau in an email on Tuesday. “Perhaps we as Republicans have more faith in our fellow citizens than Democrats have.”Or perhaps they’re just playing the poor for suckers.Bill Nemitz can be contacted at 791-6323 or at:[email protected]

473	"CONCORD — About 4,700 New Hampshire residents selected a health plan through the new federal insurance market last month, putting the state over the target for the entire enrollment period that ends March 31, President Barack Obama's administration said Tuesday.CONCORD — About 4,700 New Hampshire residents selected a health plan through the new federal insurance market last month, putting the state over the target for the entire enrollment period that ends March 31, President Barack Obama's administration said Tuesday.Figures released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services show 4,715 New Hampshire residents signed up in February, bringing the total since enrollment opened Oct. 1 to 21,578. That's well over the target of 19,000 spelled out in a Sept. 5 memo to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.Nationally, nearly 4.2 million people have signed up for private insurance under the health care law. As was the case nationally, more women have selected plans than men in New Hampshire. At 34 percent, adults ages 55 to 64 make up the largest age group, about 25 percent are ages 18 to 34, and less than 10 percent are ages 18 to 25. Nearly three-quarters have gotten financial help.Among those who signed up in February was Judy Rappe, 59, of Conway, who had gone without insurance since 2012, when her husband had to stop working after a serious car accident. Rappe said a program through her local hospital has helped pay for her prescriptions, but she was unable to afford an insurance policy until she found one through the new marketplace.Rappe, who describes herself as ""not computer-literate at all,"" met with a marketplace assister at her local library to explore her options and enroll in a plan.""Because of all the horror stories I'd seen on the news, I was very surprised it went so smooth,"" she said Tuesday.Her new policy will cost her $30 a month.""It's a good feeling,"" she said. ""Now, I just need to call up the doctor and make some appointments.""New Hampshire opted not to set up its own marketplace and is partnering with the federal government to educate consumers and manage the health plans being offered. The state Executive Council is set to vote today on whether to allow the Insurance Department to accept a $2 million federal grant for continued plan management.For now, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire is the only insurer offering health plans through the exchange, and it has faced criticism for excluding 10 of the state's 26 hospitals from its provider network. At least two other companies have said they plan to begin offering plans next year.25,000-plus Mainers picked ACA plansAUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The federal government said more than 25,000 Maine residents have picked health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, surpassing the target set by Obama's administration for the entire enrollment period that ends this month.The U.S. DHHS said Tuesday that 25,412 Maine residents selected plans on the exchange by March 1. The administration's goal was for 23,000 Mainers to be enrolled in plans by March 31, when the open enrollment period ends.Maine is one of 16 states that are using the federally run exchange.Thirty-nine percent of those who have picked plans in Maine are between the ages of 55 and 64.

The lawmakers, who have long opposed President Obama’s signature health insurance law, are now promoting one of its main provisions. AUGUSTA — Maine Republicans who are fiercely fighting an effort to expand government-subsidized health care coverage to roughly 70,000 residents have come up with an alternative: government-subsidized health care.The lawmakers have long opposed President Barack Obama’s signature health insurance law. But now they are promoting one of its main provisions, cheap and federally subsidized private plans available through the law’s insurance marketplaces, as a way to keep the state from acting on another part of the law, an expansion of Medicaid.“We understand this is the law that we have to work with right now,” said Republican Rep. Deb Sanderson of Chelsea. “This is the hand that we’ve been dealt. We have a bad hand and worse hand and, for Maine, Medicaid expansion is the worse hand.”Maine, one of six states that hasn’t decided whether to expand Medicaid under the health care law, is gearing up for more debates on the topic Wednesday.Democrats hope to get enough support for expansion to overturn a certain veto from Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who’s rejected two previous attempts to pass the bill. But many Republicans remain staunchly opposed despite the inclusion of provisions designed to attract their votes, such as implementing managed care in the Medicaid program.Republicans, whose opposition to Medicaid expansion has centered on the possibility of hefty future costs to the state, have recently shifted their focus to highlight that Mainers can instead get private plans for as little as $5 or $10 a month. Some lawmakers have even started handling out pamphlets and explaining to protesters about their options on the marketplace, also called an exchange.As part of the health care law, the federal government pays for part of some plans on the marketplace through income-based tax credits or subsidies. In Maine, more than 25,000 residents have already picked plans, surpassing the goal of having 23,000 residents signed up by the end of the open enrollment period in March.But Democrats and advocates point to the fact that those making roughly $12,000 a year won’t get help to pay for plans on the exchange, which would be about 24,000 Mainers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. They criticized the Republican tactic to push such plans.“It’s a desperate ploy at the 11th hour to appear to be concerned about the health care of 70,000 people,” said Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves of North Berwick. Maine has the opportunity accept federal dollars that will not only provide health care coverage to all those who need it in Maine, but will also bring significant benefits to the state’s economy, he said.“If this does not pass, I think going to be reflected on both as a bad human decision and a bad business decision,” he said. “You don’t forgo this kind of money and there not be consequences for our economy.”Advocates for Medicaid expansion contend that the subsidies aren’t a viable alternative for many low-income MainersMany will likely be drawn to plans on the exchange that have the lowest monthly premiums, but those plans don’t offer subsidies to help reduce the total out-of-pocket cost, said Sara Gagne-Holmes, executive director of Maine Equal Justice Partners. That means people who buy them will be on the hook for much higher costs when they seek care, she said.Senate Republican Leader Michael Thibodeau of Waldo is quick to say that Republicans are by no means support the health care law with their efforts. In fact, he questions whether the subsidies will be sustainable long term. They merely hope to point out what options Mainers have that won’t result in continued dependence on a state-run program, he said.“This exists,” he said. “I don’t know for how long. But I think Mainers should take advantage of it while it’s there.”

LETTER Sen. Doug Thomas, R-Ripley, recently wrote a letter to the editor describing MaineCare expansion as the most expensive issue in the State House. What he failed to mention is the expansion is made possible by already available federal funding and, coupled with the Affordable Care Act, is intended to save money for the people of Maine for the long term. He is incorrect in stating that all childless adults ages 19-64 can qualify for a federal subsidy under the ACA. Under current law, these individuals are often not subsidized, and it would be more affordable for Maine if they qualified for MaineCare — if Thomas and his colleagues accept the available federal funds. Thomas also states that people who would benefit from MaineCare expansion “could work if they wanted to.” He does not take into consideration those who are unable to work, unable to find jobs, or working jobs where they are underpaid and uninsured. Wouldn’t it be better if we lived in a community where we teach our children to value the lives of all people? We can show support by accepting this bill and providing health care for 70,000 residents whose lives are on the line. The first step in creating a brighter future for Maine’s people is to recognize access to affordable health care as a human right. Thomas’ vote against MaineCare is a vote against the very people whose rights he was elected to represent and protect.Elise LehotskyPortland

“Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion will harm the Kansans it’s supposed to help, add billions of dollars to the state’s budget and force the state to cut valuable programs that serve our children,” writes Steve Anderson, a former Kansas budget director and the senior adjunct fiscal policy fellow at the Kansas Policy Institute.There’s no such thing as “free money,” right? Those who support Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid in Kansas think there is. According to them, expanding the low-income health care program will give Kansans the coverage they need at no cost to our state.It’s the best of both worlds — and it’s too good to be true. If Kansas expands Medicaid under Obamacare, we’ll actually find that what we were promised can’t be delivered, and both Medicaid recipients and the middle class will pay the price.Any discussion of Medicaid should begin with its track record on patient health. On that score, Medicaid is an abject failure.Medicaid recipients consistently fare poorly on medical access and outcomes. Their access to doctors and specialists is significantly lower than those with private insurance. Their death rate in hospitals following surgery is twice as high. And children on Medicaid have much longer waits to see doctors, along with a higher chance of being turned away by health care providers.Medicaid’s moral failings should be enough to end the expansion debate. But just in case, Medicaid expansion is also an expensive endeavor that will force the state to cut funding from other important areas.Using an analysis model pioneered by other states, I estimate that Medicaid expansion will cost Kansas taxpayers between $822 million and $1.39 billion over the next decade. This will be even after the federal government’s promise to pay all of expansion’s costs for next three years, and then 90 percent of the cost after that.Kansas hospitals are expansion’s most vocal supporters; they also benefit financially from the policy.Their claim that the federal money is free also ignores that the White House has backed off of its promise to foot the bill. Previous presidential budgets included cuts to the federal government’s payment rates to below 90 percent, a dramatic change that the White House has euphemistically called a “blended rate.”Rhetoric aside, this will leave Kansas taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of millions of extra dollars each year.Even the left-wing Center on Budget and Policy Priorities now predicts that a change in federal funding levels will “prompt states to cut payments to health care providers and to scale back the health services that Medicaid covers for low-income children, parents, people with disabilities, and/or senior citizens.” In retrospect, this seems inevitable in an era of trillion dollar deficits and ever-growing federal debt.In other words, Kansas’ share of the bill could be much higher than $1.39 billion. That leaves our state Legislature with two choices: slash Medicaid payments and restrict its services, or throw more money at Medicaid to cover the shortfall.Regardless of whether Washington holds up its end of the bargain, the state Legislature will have to make hard choices about what it can afford to fund. The two biggest losers will likely be the programs that middle class families value most: Our transportation budget and our education budget. Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion will harm the Kansans it’s supposed to help, add billions of dollars to the state’s budget, and force the state to cut valuable programs that serve our children.If that’s what “free money” costs, then Kansas should pass."

481	"March 12--The number of Mainers signing up for private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act dropped off in February, but far surpassed a federal enrollment goal as a March 31 deadline looms.From the Oct. 1 launch of Healthcare.gov through March 1, 25,412 Maine residents selected a private health plan through the federal government's gateway for the marketplaces in Maine and 35 other states, according to a new report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That's up from 20,511 Mainers at the end of January, but a lag from the previous month's sign-up rate.Nationally, about 4.2 million people have signed up for health plans through Healthcare.gov and state-run marketplaces. About 900,000 signed up in February, down from 1.14 million in January and well short of the Obama administration's enrollment goals. The waning pace could spell trouble for the health care law, which administration officials had hoped would attract 6 million sign-ups by March 31, the last day of open enrollment.Maine, however, has emerged as a leader in health insurance enrollments compared to other states using Healthcare.gov. The state beat not only the federal target of 18,400 enrollments by the end of February, but also outperformed, ahead of schedule, a goal of 23,000 enrollment by the end of the month.""Maine's numbers are looking good,"" Ray Hurd, regional administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Tuesday following a Portland health insurance sign-up event.Christie Hager, regional director for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, credited Maine's ""all hands on deck"" approach for the state's enrollment success. Multiple community and health groups partnered to spread awareness of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance options, she said.Will Down, who just moved to Portland from San Diego, signed up for a new Anthem health plan at the event, with help from Liz Charles of Maine Migrant Health.""You're done,"" Charles said, high-fiving Down as the pair completed his application on Healthcare.gov.Down, 29, said he expected more of a hassle with the site, after hearing about its troubled rollout.""It was a lot easier than I thought it would be,"" he said.Sitting in front of a laptop at the Charles A. Dana Health Education Center at Maine Medical Center, Down participated in of one of three ACA sign-up events held throughout Maine Tuesday. Down, who qualified for a federal subsidy to help him afford his premium, signed up for a plan that will cost him just shy of $25 a month.&lt;p>""I don't want to go bankrupt if something bad or an accident did happen,"" he said of his choice to buy coverage.As a young, healthy enrollee, Down represents a demographic crucial to the health reform law's success. The Affordable Care Act's overhaul of the insurance market for those who buy their own coverage relies on healthy Americans, who tend to be younger, signing up to help share the risk with older, sicker consumers and keep costs from skyrocketing.In Maine, the oldest state in the nation, just 19 percent of enrollees through the end of February were aged 18-34, among the lowest showings in the country for young adult signups.Nationally, young adults aren't signing up at the rate administration officials had expected, representing a quarter of all enrollments so far. The administration previously said 40 percent of enrollees should be young adults to offset the higher costs of their older counterparts.Also called ""exchanges,"" the marketplaces are geared toward small businesses and individuals who buy their own health insurance rather than receive coverage through work or government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.Under the ACA, everyone must have health insurance this year or pay a penalty, with few exceptions. The penalty is at least $95 but potentially much more, depending on income. Those who fail to sign up by March 31 will have to wait until November for another chance to buy health insurance through the marketplaces.___(c)2014 the Bangor Daily News (Bangor, Maine)Visit the Bangor Daily News (Bangor, Maine) at www.bangordailynews.comDistributed by MCT Information ServicesInsurance marketplace numbers continue slow rise in S.C.White Bear Lake man celebrates 90th birthday in prison – voluntarilyGet breaking news, exclusive stories, and money- making insights straight into your inbox.

  While Utah would not have chosen the difficult dilemma we now face, action on the issue of expansion of Medicaid coverage must be taken to respond to a significant flaw in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).Why is this? Utahns are paying hundreds of millions of dollars in federal taxes in order to fund insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion occurring in other states.  While this is neither fair nor right, it is the current reality.So, what can we do?  As one of the best managed, most fiscally prudent and business friendly states in the nation, Utah should embrace a solution that is flexible and Utah-specific. Our business community and our citizens already benefit from a state health system that is the envy of the nation. The innovations, efficiencies and talented work force in Utah&apos;s health care industry drive down costs and deliver better outcomes for our state. We need a Utah solution that considers the financial resources of our state and also the health needs of our most vulnerable citizens. Our solution must avoid leaving some 60,000 Utahns without health care coverage. Failure to do so will ensure increased health care premiums for all insured Utahns and for every business in our state, as we all pay for the costs of uncovered emergency room utilization and other unpaid care. Our community will be healthier and financially stronger as we utilize available federal dollars to provide access to health coverage for the poorest among us. This is both the right thing for our citizens most in need and the right thing for our economy.We should pursue all available federal dollars to develop a flexible solution that strengthens a competitive, private insurance market, promotes individual accountability by those receiving assistance, and prevents the state from being left on the hook for providing additional ongoing benefits if the federal government becomes unable or unwilling to hold up its end of the bargain. We believe these aims can be achieved through the innovative approach Gov. Gary Herbert is proposing.The difficult choices that now lay before the Legislature are complex. Sound economic and moral principles drive good public policy. To that end, we should advance Herbert&apos;s proposal to keep Utahns&apos; hard earned dollars in Utah to care for the poorest among us while also strengthening the private health care market. Andrew Croshaw, president of Leavitt Partners Consulting, and Marc Bennett, president and CEO of HealthInsight, are co-chairs of the Salt Lake Chamber&apos;s Health System Reform Task Force.

The Affordable Care Act has caused confusion. It is a significant departure from what has been the American health care payment system, and it depends on nearly all of us to participate so that we can begin to see how it benefits us all. There is still time. Enroll today.As of April 1, Americans are required by law to be covered by a health plan — from an employer or government program such as Medicare or Medicaid, or individually purchased on a government-run exchange or through an agent or broker.But many people remain uninsured — some for philosophical reasons; others because they have not been able to afford the premium on any plan, or have had changes in circumstance since Jan. 1 and are now uninsured.People may choose to go uninsured and pay a relatively small fine imposed by the IRS, and accept that remaining uninsured is risky. There are some exemptions to paying that fine, but there are no exemptions for what is owed for medical bills. If you or an immediate family member becomes ill or is injured, you are responsible for paying for all the necessary medical care. Non-payment of medical bills is the most common reason for declaration of bankruptcy.You may decide that Obamacare is socialized medicine, and that a requirement to be insured violates your freedom of choice. But in fact, Obamacare uses private insurance companies, free markets, and freedom of choice to provide coverage. These plans are regulated but not managed by the state and federal governments.In 1965, when Medicare was introduced, many considered it to be socialized medicine. But in the past 49 years, the American public has overwhelmingly rated its satisfaction with Medicare much higher than its satisfaction with private insurance. Because so many Americans believe that the emergency room can be a clinic for the uninsured, the medical community has been forced to cut back on services previously available. Emergency care is expensive, and emergency rooms are required only to stabilize a patient before releasing that person.If you think that you cannot afford any insurance plan premium, be sure that you have investigated the subsidies the government offers. That can substantially reduce a premium’s cost, your out-of-pocket responsibility, or both. More than half of the Americans who have enrolled for health care coverage on the government exchange have qualified for a subsidy.Another area to explore is whether you may qualify for catastrophic coverage. That is offered at an extremely low premium cost. If your application for one of these programs was denied, there is an appeals process available.Medicaid has long been a government subsidized option for low-income individuals, but there have been changes in this safety net. The Supreme Court made the decision in 2012 that states could decide whether they wanted to participate in an expansion of Medicaid. The ACA expands Medicaid to a national eligibility floor of 138 percent of the federal poverty level and provides 100 percent federal financing for those newly eligible for Medicaid from 2014 through 2016. The federal contribution phases down to 90 percent by 2020. After 2020, the federal funding will remain at 90 percent. But some states, including Missouri and Kansas, declined this opportunity.As of January 2014, in Kansas, Medicaid eligibility for non-disabled adults is limited to parents with incomes below 38 percent of poverty, or about $9,000 a year for a family of four, and adults without dependent children remain ineligible regardless of their income. In Missouri, Medicaid eligibility for non-disabled adults is limited to parents with incomes below 23 percent of poverty, or about $5,500 a year for a family of four. Adults without dependent children remain ineligible regardless of their income.If your desire to enroll in a medical insurance plan occurs on April 1, 2014 or later, you must have what is known as a “qualifying life event.” That applies to coverage purchased both on- and off-the exchange. These events include the birth or adoption of a child, change in marital status, a permanent move to a new area that offers different health plan options, losing other health coverage due to job loss, loss of eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP, expiration of COBRA benefits, or having your health plan decertified. Note that losing coverage because of non-payment of premiums or voluntarily choosing to quit your current health plan are not qualifying life events.If you enrolled in a health plan on the exchange, any change in income can affect your eligibility for tax credits. Be sure to report this change within 60 days of when it occurs so that you have the opportunity to change your plan.With these exceptions, as of March 31, the uninsured will have to remain without coverage. The next open enrollment period is scheduled to run from Nov. 15 to Jan. 15.The Affordable Care Act has caused confusion. It is a significant departure from what has been the American health care payment system, and it depends on nearly all of us to participate so that we can begin to see how it benefits us all.

Victoria Stout made the journey all the way from St. Petersburg, where after two and a half years of being out of work, she's finally landed a job.
""I'm starting to get part-time, seasonal employment, and of course, just at this time, mandatory insurance comes along, which, love to have some health insurance, I haven't been able to afford it yet,"" she said. ""But, I still don't make enough money, and chances are I won't.""
Under a deal being offered by the federal government, Stout would be able to get Medicaid coverage, but Florida would have to accept $51 billion in federal funding. That's something Republican lawmakers are refusing to do.
Far from providing more security, state House Republicans argue expanding Medicaid would be a gamble, as they don't trust Washington would come through on its end of the bargain. If that were to happen, Florida would be stuck with the tab.
Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, cited the nation's ballooning national debt as a cause for concern.
""Why in the world would we take the federal government's position with Medicaid when they promise that they'll pay for Medicaid expansion when we know that they will be unable to keep that promise in the long run?"" he said.
Last year, Gov. Rick Scott tried to convince his fellow Republicans to re-consider - and failed.
Now Stout said it's up to people like her to lead the fight for expansion, an issue she argues isn't just about health but about fairness.
""You get rewarded for not working; you get punished for working,"" she said. ""I've found that out in so many ways.
Stout said the issue can all be fixed, if only lawmakers act.
Activists said they plan to focus most of their attention on House Speaker Will Weatherford, who is leading the charge to reject the federal funds.

490	By Christine Kerncontributing writerRepublicans say new analysis of Medicaid Enrollment may not be telling the whole truthNew research from Avalere Health estimates that between 2.4 million and 3.5 million Americans were newly enrolled in Medicaid from October through January as a result of the Affordable Care Act.According to Modern Healthcare, the Obama administration has said that 8.9 million individuals are eligible for Medicare or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) through state Medicaid agencies and state-run insurance exchanges, and an additional 1.2 million are Medicaid-eligible through HealthCare.gov.According to Avalere’s website, these enrollment estimates were developed by comparing reported data on new enrollments from October through January to enrollment rates from the summer of 2013. The estimates include both individuals who are newly eligible for Medicaid as a result of states’ expanding eligibility under the ACA and those who were previously eligible but newly enrolled due to greater awareness of coverage options (also known as the “woodwork” population). Avalere’s estimates remove individuals who would have been enrolled in Medicaid absent the ACA, including eligibility renewals in some states.Avalere's estimate includes Medicaid enrollment both through the federally run and state-run exchanges. Avalere compared the number of new Medicaid and CHIP applications from October through January to the average monthly number of applications submitted from July through September of 2013 as a control.Avalere’s study indicated that as of Jan. 31, between 1.7 million and 2.7 million people were newly enrolled in the states that have expanded Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, while 700,000 to 800,000 people were newly enrolled in the non-expansion states.These numbers are being challenged by officials in the mostly Republican-led states relying on the federal HealthCare.gov insurance exchange to determine Medicaid eligibility, who argue the actual number of people who have successfully enrolled in their states may only be in the tens of thousands. Obamacare and the expansion of Medicare generally have been opposed by elected Republican officials in those states.Modern Healthcare reports that Texas, for example, which has the highest percentage of uninsured in the country, has processed 6,703 Medicaid files for individuals received from the federal exchange, according to state Medicaid officials. However, of those, only 904 have been approved and enrolled for coverage. The rest were either already on Medicaid, not eligible, or didn't complete their applications. CMS says it has found 392,675 Texans to be eligible for Medicaid since the federal insurance exchange opened.Officials in several Republican-led states relying on HealthCare.gov said they doubted enrollment figures in the non-expansion states were remotely close to the 1 million mark, including both new enrollees and people re-enrolling into the program through Healthcare.gov. State officials from Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Mississippi, and Wyoming told Modern Healthcare the number of Medicaid applications from HealthCare.gov actually processed was very low, either because they aren't receiving them yet or because they are in a testing phase during which the CMS is sending them Medicaid applications to check on the connection between the federal and state databases. They say the CMS has told them not to make eligibility determinations until the testing process is completed.Idaho, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Maine have all received far fewer completed applications than the number of those estimated to be eligible. Tom Shanahan, a spokesman for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, reported, “Idaho is not yet getting the enrollment numbers in Medicaid that were expected. We projected about 35,000 individuals to be eligible but not covered. As of today, the only new enrollments that can be counted are the 1,900 that have come from HealthCare.gov.”	Health

Comments Off on Health care reform and the 60 day repayment rule
As most are aware, the federal government, primarily through its Medicare program that pays healthcare costs of America’s seniors, is the preeminent payer of healthcare in the United States. In addition, Medicaid, as administered by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, provides a limited safety net for Idaho’s poor. As such, Medicaid is also a major payer in the healthcare market.For a healthcare provider to be reimbursed for providing Medicare or Medicaid services, the provider must make sure that it satisfies certain requirements. If the provider fails to meet these conditions of payment—even by mistake—the provider is not entitled to receive the reimbursement.Occasionally, after receiving a Medicare or Medicaid payment, a provider may discover that the claim or a series of claims that it submitted did not meet the applicable conditions of payment. Perhaps a required medical record or hospital admission order is missing. Or maybe a required signature was not on the record. When this happens, the provider is required to proactively return the payment, known as an overpayment. This repayment obligation applies even when the provider simply made a mistake. Now more than ever, Idaho’s healthcare providers are making repayments to Medicare and Medicaid.As part of the healthcare reform in recent years, this repayment obligation has become more serious. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, added a provision requiring Medicare and Medicaid providers to report and return an overpayment within 60 days after the overpayment had been “identified.” The most sobering part of this 60-day requirement is that if the provider does not make the repayment by the 60-day deadline, the provider may become liable for significant penalties and damages under the False Claims Act and potentially risk exclusion from further participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Under the False Claims Act (FCA), a provider could be liable for a civil penalty of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, in addition to three times the amount of the damages sustained by the government as a result of the false claim. While we are not aware of any FCA cases in Idaho relating to the 60-day rule, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Idaho prosecutes FCA cases against Medicare and Medicaid providers.Since this 60-day rule was passed in 2010, providers have struggled to determine when an overpayment has been “identified.” In other words, when does the 60-day clock start ticking? While it is clear that the clock starts once the overpayment has been “identified,” the ACA unfortunately did not define or explain when the overpayment has been “identified.” Does the 60 days start from the moment the provider first learned of a potential overpayment by an anonymous tip, for example? Or does it start once the provider has conducted a thorough investigation to determine whether the potential overpayment is actually an overpayment? The statute does not answer these questions.In February 2012, nearly two years after the 60-day rule was passed, the government finally provided some guidance about the rule. At that time, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services responsible for the administration of Medicare and Medicaid, issued proposed regulations interpreting the rule.While CMS’s proposed regulations provided some direction to providers about when the 60-day clock started, they did not answer all of the questions. An additional problem is that these proposed regulations have yet to be finalized, more than two years after their publication. CMS’s delay in finalizing the regulations is likely due, at least in part, to the negative reaction they have received. For instance, one of the proposals that has been largely rejected by the healthcare industry is CMS’s plan to increase the look-back period (the period during which Medicare claims remain subject to reopening and adjustment) to ten years—a significant expansion over the reopening periods allowed by CMS’s current regulations. With this enlarged lookback period, a provider would be responsible for investigating and determining if a potential overpayment—even one that was the result of a simple mistake up to a decade ago—was an overpayment. Not surprisingly, this ten-year lookback period proposal received a disapproving response from the healthcare industry.At this time, what is the status of the 60-day repayment rule? Even though CMS has yet to finalize any regulations regarding the rule, and even though it may not be clear in many cases when an overpayment has been “identified”—and when the 60-day clock starts ticking—providers still need to repay overpayments within the 60 days of when they are “identified” to avoid liability under the False Claims Act. Needless to say, with only 60 days to make the repayment once the clock starts, when providers become aware that they have, or may have, received an overpayment, they should move quickly and cautiously.Mr. Olson is a partner at Hawley Troxell and a member of the firm’s health law group.

Also: Ugly Twitter fight reveals battle for Republican voice. Decisive votes could be held this week on the expansion of Medicaid, a key issue for Democrats who control the Legislature, but partisan operatives and lawmakers are already positioning the issue for the upcoming election.Republicans who oppose the expansion of Medicaid – which operates in Maine as MaineCare – seem confident that they have the votes to block a compromise bill co-sponsored by moderate Republican Sens. Roger Katz of Augusta and Thomas Saviello of Wilton. Their measure was designed to attract moderate Republican support by expanding MaineCare coverage but also imposing a managed care system on the entire program, which serves about 320,000 low-income residents.Democrats are expected to walk away from the Katz-Saviello bill if it doesn’t gain enough support in early voting to overcome an anticipated veto by Gov. Paul LePage. Democrats would then shift their focus to a bill sponsored by House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, which would expand MaineCare without creating a managed care system. The Eves bill was endorsed Thursday by the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee in a straight party-line vote.Democrats are not thrilled with the managed care component of the Katz-Saviello bill, which they viewed as a major policy concession.Either way, the expansion bills face stiff, if not unmovable, opposition. And Democrats appear to know it. On Friday, there wasn’t a peep about Medicaid expansion in the Democrats’ weekly radio address, a platform that would typically be used to build momentum in advance of looming House and Senate votes.Taxpayer-funded health care for more than 60,000 people and the economic vitality of some of the state’s hospitals is on the line with the upcoming votes. Their fates will also be messaged in legislative and gubernatorial races.Some Democrats are promising an electoral reckoning for Republicans if expansion doesn’t pass. Lawmakers and operatives have said privately that the issue is ready-made for the campaign, citing enthusiasm in the Democratic base and internal polls that show support from independent voters.Democratic gubernatorial candidates, backed by ads by Moveon.org and other progressive groups, have slammed Republican governors in Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Texas for not supporting expansion and denying health care to thousands of people.However, as we’ve seen in Maine, public opinion on Medicaid hinges on how the issue is framed. In other states, Republicans have emphasized Medicaid expansion’s connection with Obamacare, which had a disastrous roll-out.National Republican pundits are predicting a popular revolt like the one in 2010 – the same year Gov. Paul LePage and Republicans swept the State House – if the health care law continues to falter.Democrats are worried. Last week, the Obama administration announced that it was further delaying a provision in the law that would have required consumers to replace individual policies that don’t meet Obamacare guidelines. The move was viewed as mostly political, an attempt to help Democrats in midterm races because it would prevent the cancellation of policies, and the accompanying bad press, at the apex of the election season.Maine Republicans have attached another pejorative to expansion – “welfare” – for the double-whammy: “Obamacare’s welfare expansion.” The belief among Republicans is that a message utilizing one or both of those terms will boost their chances of success in November.The battle against welfare is already a centerpiece of LePage’s campaign, which has the advantage of playing to the governor’s base of support in his three-way race for re-election with Democrat Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler.After all, if the governor can blame welfare for the proliferation of invasive green crabs on the Maine coast, as he did during the recent Fishermen’s Forum, then he might be able to take credit for defeating “Obamacare’s welfare expansion” in November.BIG TENTThere was an ugly Twitter fight on the #mepolitics thread last week between Dan Demeritt, LePage’s former communications director, and David Sorensen, the current communications director for the House Republican Office.At issue: the official voice for Maine Republicans, apparently.Demeritt, who writes a column for the Maine Sunday Telegram every other week and is a political consultant, last week wrote that Maine Republicans should fold the debate over new federal emission standards for wood stoves into their candidate platforms.On Tuesday, the Capitol Ticker blog for the Portland Press Herald noted that the LePage campaign had done just that by reposting on its Facebook page an item from the Maine Republican Party condemning the regulations and trying to link them to the Democratic candidate for governor, U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud. (The post said Michaud was taking orders from his “political commander,” President Obama.)Some folks on Twitter quickly credited Demeritt for the idea, which prompted Sorensen to say doing so was a mistake, that it was an “obvious issue” to push. Demeritt conceded as much, but the discussion quickly turned nasty. Demeritt questioned why Sorensen was picking a fight with him on Twitter, telling him to grow up. Sorensen responded: “You’re an untrustworthy bottom feeder, no credibility or access.” He added that the Press Herald and Maine Public Broadcasting Network should can Demeritt as a Republican pundit.Jason Savage, the executive director of the Maine Republican Party, jumped in, describing Demeritt as a “liberal GOP” operative appointed by the media. A blogger for the Maine Heritage Policy Center added that going to Demeritt for “conservative opinion is like looking for oranges on an apple tree.”Ouch.So what’s behind all the ill will?It’s a long story, but probably doesn’t help that Demeritt is currently consulting for the Maine Medical Association, which supports Medicaid expansion.Also, Demeritt ruffled some feathers when he was LePage’s spokesman and there were signs that Republican operatives secretly played a part in forcing him out of the governor’s office in 2011. He’s long suspected it. Since then, he’s tried to carve out a niche as a conservative opinion leader who writes and talks about politics from his perspective. He doesn’t claim to represent the Maine Republican Party. However, there are some Republicans who think he should use his media platforms to amplify the party’s sanctioned views or vacate the position so someone else can.This desire is not confined to Republicans, by the way; Democrats prefer friendly, uncritical voices in the opinion pages, too.Democrats just haven’t aired their motives on Twitter.Steve Mistler can be contacted at 791-6345 or at:[email protected]Twitter: @stevemistler

499	"HANNIBAL, Mo. – Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster –  now running for governor -- dove straight into the health-care debate Saturday when he attacked his former Republican colleagues for opposing Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act.“The Affordable Care Act was a Republican idea, for goodness sakes,” Koster declared. “They’re just pissed that we stole it.”          Credit File Photo    Koster’s audience included several hundred at this weekend’s Democrat Days, the annual regional event that traditionally kicks off the party’s campaign season leading up to this fall’s election. He noted that the event was the first Democratic gathering he attended after leaving the Republican Party in 2007 and that he has shown up annually ever since.In essence, Koster -- the featured speaker at Saturday's brunch -- said that the GOP’s approach to health care, as well as public education and care of the elderly, boiled down to a single thesis: “Survival of the fittest.”""We Democrats believe in a basic bargain,” he countered. “Our children should be educated. Our sick should have medicine, and our seniors should never live in poverty.”Although he touched on all three topics, the bulk of his speech centered on health care -- and how it influenced his decision to switch parties.“There may be no issue with which I disagree more with my former party than the issue of public health,” Koster said, touching off repeated applause. “On issues of medical research, on access to contraception, on expansion of health care to low- and moderate-income citizens…I am still frustrated by my former party’s 1950s-style public-health policies.”         Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster addresses Democrats on Saturday in Hannibal, Mo. Credit Jo Mannies/St. Louis Public Radio    “Our job as Democrats is to speak clearly on this issue,’’ he continued. “I left the Republican Party over their foolishness on health care... Now, the Hospital Association has left them, the Chambers of Commerce of this state has left them. For god’s sake, even Kit Bond has left them.”Bond, a former Republican governor and U.S. senator, has been hired by business groups to persuade resistant Republican lawmakers to expand Medicaid in Missouri. The federal government would pay all the additional costs for the first three years and at least 90 percent thereafter. Opponents say the state's costs would still be too high. Many conservatives also oppose expanding the government's role in health care.Rural Missouri and Medicaid expansionKoster’s call for Democrats to highlight proudly their support of the federal health insurance law was particularly stunning because many national Democrats, and some in Missouri, have been skittish about it. They believe that the congressional battle several years over the Affordable Care Act contributed to the Democratic election losses nationally and in Missouri in 2010.Some Republicans believe that emphasizing their continued opposition to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion could help the GOP this fall.Koster, however, disagreed. And in Hannibal he appeared to have company from fellow Democrats who said that rural voters – who generally now vote Republican – are coming around on Medicaid, in part because of rural hospitals’ warnings of cutbacks or closings if the expansion is rejected.The money from the expansion is to replace the federal money, soon to be cut, that hospitals now receive for caring for the uninsured. Rural hospitals, in particular, say they may not survive without federal help.“The rural hospitals are suffering,’’ said John Yancy, a longtime organizer of Democrat Days and a member of the local county Democratic committee.  That view was echoed by virtually all Democratic attendees asked to name their top issue.GOP focused on Obama?Koster said in an interview that he was simply in line with Gov. Jay Nixon, a fellow Democrat, who has lobbied for expansion since shortly after winning re-election late 2012. But there is a difference; Koster is espousing the issue before an election, not after.Among other things, Koster accused the state’s Republican leaders of  embracing “the same angry stubbornness” that the GOP espoused in its failed legislative efforts in 2005 to ban certain stem cell research. That led to the narrow statewide passage in 2006 of a constitutional amendment protecting such research.         Campaign buttons promoting Hillary Clinton for president were the most popular item for sale at Democrat Days, salesmen said. Credit Jo Mannies/ St. Louis Public Radio    Expanding Medicaid coverage to roughly 300,000 more Missourians would do more than just improve their health, Koster went on.“Put aside the lives that this will save. Put aside the healthy outcomes that will result. Put aside the emergency room visits that never should occur,” he told the crowd. “This expansion proposal is still the best darn economic development proposal that this state has seen in the last 25 years.”He cited health experts’ estimates that Medicaid expansion would bring 24,000 new jobs to the state, as well as the $8 billion in promised federal money over six years.Koster then concluded, “And for no other reason than because Barack Obama passed it, this legislature is willing to deny the health and economic benefits of  expansion simply to spite a president.”Democratic candidate for state auditorFor all the focus on health care, Missouri Democrats in Hannibal seemed to spend little time discussing a key party problem as it heads into the fall. With only two weeks left for candidate filing, the Democrats have yet to find a prominent figure to run for state auditor, challenging Republican incumbent Tom Schweich.State Democratic Party Roy Temple said earlier that he wasn’t focused on the matter. And that appears to also be the case for many rank and file Democrats.Those in Hannibal seemed more interested in discussing how the party can best cut into the huge edge that Republicans now hold in the Missouri House and Senate. That majority has been built largely by GOP success in decimating the Democratic ranks in rural Missouri.State Rep. Ed Schieffer, D-Troy, introduced himself Saturday as “the last Democrat in the Missouri House from northeast Missouri.” His few remaining colleagues were ousted in 2012.Schieffer is now running for the state Senate and says he’s “cautiously optimistic” – in part because of the issue of Medicaid expansion.As for state auditor, some Democrats were privately contending that Koster -- who now wields significant behind-the-scenes power in state Democratic politics -- opposes mounting a strong challenger to Schweich and is discouraging any major Democrats from filing.They said that Koster would rather run against Schweich for governor in 2016 and would like to see him well-funded for a possible primary battle against former House Speaker Catherine Hanaway, a Republican from St. Louis County who recently announced she’s running for governor.In an interview, Koster dismissed such talk as “overly complicated political gossip.”View the discussion thread.(Updated 1:10 p.m. Mon., Feb. 10)  Within a few weeks, it’s Show-Me time for Missouri’s two major political parties — the Republicans and Democrats – as they showcase their new chairmen and their biggest stars for what could be a crucial election year. At a time when the public is increasingly turning away from organized political parties and classifying themselves as independents, it’s still largely up to the political parties and their networks to round up the contenders to run for office.(Updated 1:10 p.m. Mon., Feb. 10) Within a few weeks, it’s Show-Me time for Missouri’s two major political parties — the Republicans and Democrats – as they showcase their new chairmen and their biggest stars for what could be a crucial election year.At a time when the public is increasingly turning away from organized political parties and classifying themselves as independents, it’s still largely up to the political parties and their networks to round up the contenders to run for office.

500	"HANNIBAL, Mo. – Chris Koster came to Hannibal for the annual Democrat Days gathering seven years ago this weekend as a first-time Democrat.
It was the then-Repbulican state senator’s first large Democratic gathering after announcing his switch from the Republican Party, and he said he was nervous. So nervous, he brought his mom. The wariness that he may have faced during his first trip to Democrat Days was nowhere to be found this year, as attendees rushed to grab photos with the state’s now second-term attorney general and encouraging him as he readies to be the party’s standard-bearer in 2016. Here in Hannibal and elsewhere on the campaign trail, Koster does not shy from talking about his party switch. And when he brings it up, he gets cheers.  Speaking here on Saturday as the party’s presumptive nominee for governor in 2016, Koster said the same issues that brought him to Hannibal after leaving the Republican Party in 2007 are the issues that the state is facing, yet again, in 2014. “I quit my party over a disagreement over public health,” he told Democrats gathered for an annual brunch.   Koster touted his support of the 2010 federal health care law, noting new access to contraceptive services for women and a provision barring insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Koster questioned why Republicans were against the policy, parts of which were first pitched by conservative groups in the 1990’s as an alternative to then-First Lady Hilary Clinton’s health care proposal. “The Affordable Care Act was a Republican idea, for goodness sake,” he said. “It’s an honest to god Republican idea, they’re just pissed we stole it.” Koster said perhaps his biggest frustration with his former party’s health care positioning now is its opposition to Medicaid expansion. “This expansion proposal is the best darn economic development proposal this state has seen in the last 25 years,” he said. “For no other reason than because Barack Obama passed it, this legislature is willing to deny the health and economic benefits of expansion simply to spite a president.” Koster noted support from the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and former U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, a Republican who was a vocal opponent of the 2010 health care law, which was passed during his final year in the Senate. Koster said the potential economic benefits of Medicaid expansion are undeniable. “The bill has been passed. Sen. Bond is walking the halls trying to convince Democrats and Republicans to accept $2 billion,” he said in an interview. “If you had $2 billion dollars sitting on your front door, wouldn’t you take it?” One reason Republicans offer is broad public opposition in Missouri and elsewhere to the federal health care law. When different provisions of the law have been on the ballot, Missourians have overwhelmingly opposed them. Still, Koster said he believes Medicaid expansion is different.  “The Affordable Care Act is unpopular, but the $2 billion federal offer and the expansion of economic opportunity that is being offered to us doesn’t strike me as unpopular,” he said. “Increasingly when I talk with members of the General Assembly, including Republicans, they are looking for a way out of this.” Koster’s vocal support of the federal health care law stands in contrast to his only announced Republican opponent, former House Speaker Catherine Hanaway, who has voiced opposition to the law in full, including the Medicaid expansion provision. “I am against any further expansion of Obamacare. Therefore, I am against Gov. Nixon’s proposed expansion of Medicaid,” she said earlier this month. “I lived through the expansions of Medicaid that Gov. Carnahan put on the books and the strife required to shrink back those expansions when the state could no longer afford them.”Hanaway said she, like Republicans in the General Assembly, believes it would be “ill-advised for Missouri” to accept the federal funds when they will be rolled back in 2020, requiring the state to take on a 10 percent share of the burden.  Koster was the keynote speaker at the morning brunch in Hannibal. Secretary of State Jason Kander was scheduled to speak Saturday evening to the annual dinner.

501	"https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/03/12/five-allegations-against-riken-stem-cell-researcher-in-japan/ Japan’s Riken institute said this week it was weighing a retraction of breakthrough stem-cell research led by a Japanese scientist. The research, published in the journal Nature, purported to describe a safer and easier technique for creating stem cells.Why consider a retraction? Here are five allegations raised about the research and its lead author, Haruko Obokata. Riken said it was investigating the allegations and planned to announce interim findings Friday. Dr. Obokata didn’t return emails seeking comment.Irregularities in images:1) In one of the two papers in Nature describing the research, images of two placentas from supposedly separate experiments look similar. This allegation, made in science blogs including PubPeer, was among the first to be raised and prompted Riken to open an investigation Feb. 13.2) Images used in Nature look strikingly similar to images used in Dr. Obokata’s 2011 doctoral dissertation but come from a different experiment at a different time, according to Teruhiko Wakayama of Yamanashi University, a co-author of the papers. Dr. Wakayama said this discovery prompted him to call this week for a retraction. Japan’s national broadcaster NHK aired a segment comparing the two sets of images.Charles Vacanti of Harvard Medical School, a co-author of both papers, said some mistakes were made in the papers but they don’t affect the conclusions.Allegations of copied material:3) A portion of the Nature paper describing how the researchers viewed chromosomes under a microscope was nearly identical to a section from a separate paper titled “Multicolor Karyotype Analyses of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells” published in 2005 by researchers from a German university.4) A Japanese blogger who has been tracking suspicions over the stem-cell studies posted what he said was the 2011 Obokata dissertation submitted to Waseda University. Large portions of the document were identical to a U.S. National Institutes of Health website on stem cells. A Waseda spokesman said he believed the document was indeed Dr. Obokata’s dissertation and said the university was investigating the allegations.Inconsistencies between Nature paper and authors’ subsequent explanation:5) On March 5, Riken released new tips on methods Dr. Obokata and fellow Riken scientists used to create stem cells. But blogs like the Knoepfler Lab Stem Cell Blog, run by Paul Knoepfler, a stem-cell researcher at the University of California, Davis, pointed out inconsistencies between the new description of the methods and the original paper. In particular, Dr. Knoepfler said the new description suggested that the stem cells didn’t derive from white blood cells as the original paper said.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent to

The Japanese government has asked the Riken Center for Developmental Biology to closely look into the issue of errors in the supposedly groundbreaking research paper on “stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency,” or STAP cells. This comes after one of the authors of the study said they want it to be withdrawn until further research confirms its credibility.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that Riken has reported to them that they are conducting a thorough investigation into it, inviting both local and international experts to take a look into it. He also encouraged the institute to hold a press conference so they can properly explain the process of the investigation as well as the details of the study that are under question. But Minister for Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Hakubun Shimomura, said that he is hoping that after this “objective probe” is finished, they will be able to resubmit the paper to the science journal, Nature.Riken  released a statement on Tuesday saying the study might be withdrawn due to questions on its reliability and research ethics. While they still believe that the “crux of the paper remains unwavering”, they are taking seriously the allegations made by certain netizens that the study contains errors, including images, anomalous lines in the DNA fragments and a section that is almost identical with another paper. They are expected to reveal the interim results of their investigation by Wednesday. University of Yamanashi professor Teruhiko Wakayama said on Monday, “It’s better to retract it once and submit it again after making sure that the data is all correct and it won’t be criticized by anyone.” But one of the 14 people who published it in the journal last January, Charles Vacanti of Harvard Medical School, said that although some mistakes were made, he sees no reason why they should retract the paper as these errors did not affect the final conclusion of the study.

  One of the co-authors of the joint Japanese/American research,
  Professor Teruhiko Wakayama of Yamanashi University, has decided
  to carefully review his team’s study on the creation of stem
  cells (cells that can grow into any type of organ or tissue).
  This followed claims by science colleagues that the erroneous
  image data was used for the article published in the journal
  Nature.
“I have lost faith in the paper. Overall there are now just
  too many uncertainties about it. I think we have to wait for some
  confirmation,” Wakayama told NHK. “To check the legitimacy of the
  paper, we should retract it, prepare proper data and images, and
  then use those to demonstrate, with confidence, that the paper is
  correct.”""When conducting the experiment, I believed it was absolutely
  right,"" Wakayama said, adding that if it turns out to be
  wrong, it would be essential to make it clear why a thing like
  that could have happened.

  The leader of the research team, Japanese researcher Haruko
  Obokata together with US scientists announced a breakthrough in
  January: a cheap way to produce valuable embryonic-like stem
  cells without having to terminate any embryos. The study promised
  to usher in a new era in stem cell biology, as the prominence of
  stem cell use grew with the realization of just how much we could
  accomplish in the way of battling a huge variety of diseases.
  This is because of the cells’ ability to mimic other cells in the
  body.

  What Obokata from the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in
  Japan and researchers from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH)
  allegedly found at the time was that an adult cell (also known as
  a “somatic” cell) had the potential to transform into a copy of
  an embryonic stem cell as a result of a simple process. The
  scientists subjected cells to external stress, ""almost to the
  point of death”, by exposing them to various hostile
  environments, for instance, acid or low oxygen. Within a few days
  the cells (called Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency,
  or STAP, cells) survived and recovered from the stressful
  stimulus by naturally reverting into a state that is equivalent
  to an embryonic stem cell, the researchers said.

  Within weeks of its publication on January 29, the study faced
  criticism of irregularities in visual data and allegedly
  duplicated imagery. Added to that was the problem some scientists
  were having trouble reproducing the ‘simple’ technique promised
  by researchers doing the study.

  Wakayama was in charge of the part of the experiment that checked
  if the cells had acquired pluripotency – the ability to shift
  properties to those resembling an embryo cell. He said a change
  in a specific gene was to be proof. He pointed out that after
  RIKEN disclosed detailed procedures for making STAP cells, in the
  newly released procedures RIKEN says this change didn't take
  place, NHK reported.

  RIKEN said it has launched an independent investigation in the
  content of the paper. Nature has responded promptly with its own
  probe. In an e-mailed statement, the journal said: ""Issues
  relating to this paper have been brought to Nature's attention
  and we are conducting an ongoing investigation. We have no
  further comment at this stage.""
  But not all believe that mistakes were made; among them is
  Hitoshi Niwa, who also contributed to the article in Nature sees
  the hiccups with the picture data as only “minor
  mistakes,” according to Japanese media. Joining him is
  Charles Vanati, a tissue engineer with Harvard Medical School and
  BWH, who told The Wall Street Journal that “based on the
  information I have, I see no reason why these papers should be
  retracted… it would be very sad to have such an important paper
  retracted as a result of peer pressure, when indeed the data and
  conclusions are honest and valid.”RT News App© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2018. All rights reserved."	Health

507	"A number of scientists have been grumbling for weeks about a pair of breakthrough stem cell studies that seemed too good to be true. Now one of the senior researchers who worked on the papers agrees that they may be right.The studies, which were published in January by the journal Nature, described a surprisingly simple method of transforming mature cells into pluripotent stem cells capable of regenerating any type of tissue in the body. The key was to stress them out by soaking them in an acid bath for 30 minutes, prompting genetic changes that made the cells more flexible. The researchers dubbed their technique “stimulus triggered acquisition of pluripotency,” or STAP.But Teruhiko Wakayama, a senior author of one of the papers and coauthor on the other, said he had lost confidence in the studies and was ""no longer sure the STAP cells were actually created,” according to NHK.Wakayama, a professor at the University of Yamanashi in Kofu, Japan, told Japanese media Monday that he had asked his collaborators to withdraw the studies until the results could be verified by independent scientists. He added that “he is ready to provide cell samples and detailed data” to anyone who is willing to try, NHK reported.RELATED: New method makes stem cells in about 30 minutes, scientists report Wakayama also echoed concerns raised by others that some of the images used in the Nature papers may have been published previously. According to Japan News, an English-language website from Yomiuri Shimbun, Wakayama said the images “look almost identical” to images that appear in the PhD thesis of Haruko Obokata, the lead author of both Nature studies. Her thesis was about pluripotent stem cells in humans, but the cells in the Nature STAP paper were supposedly from mice.Anonymous posters to a website called PubPeer have flagged several images in the Nature papers that they say look suspiciously like pictures in a 2011 study led by Obokata. That study, published in the journal Tissue Engineering, purports to show that cells removed from various tissues of adult mice could be coaxed to grow into other kinds of cells.Duplicated images aren’t the only problem skeptics have flagged. A Japanese blog post has noted striking similarities in the words used to describe some of the methods used in one of the Nature papers and the words in a 2005 paper published in a journal called In Vitro Cellular & Developmental Biology – Animal. In the blog post, the overlapping language is highlighted in red.“There sure seems to be a lot of overlap in text in the two papers,” Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell researcher at UC Davis, wrote on his blog.“I’ve heard people react to this by saying 'no big deal, it’s just a methods section,' while I’ve heard others say 'this is misconduct,'” Knoepfler added. “I’m sure many people fall somewhere in the middle.”Knoepfler has been blogging about the STAP research since the day the studies were published on Nature’s website nearly six weeks ago. Right away, something about them seemed odd.“After a relatively quick read, no particular red flags jump out at me from the STAP cell paper,” he wrote on his blog. “It just seems too good and too simple of a method to be true, but the data would suggest so far at least that this team is onto something really important.”As the days and weeks passed, Knoepfler’s suspicions grew. He has posted polls asking readers to weigh in on whether they think STAP cells are “real.” (At the moment, only 17% are pretty convinced that they are real, while 52% are pretty convinced that they are not.) He has also asked fellow researchers who are trying to make STAP cells in their own labs to share their results. So far, none have succeeded.These concerns and others prompted the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, where Obokata works, to launch an investigation into the matter in mid-February. That inquiry is still ongoing, with the research institution considering whether to withdraw the STAP studies, Japan News reported Tuesday. More details are expected Friday.Nature, the London-based journal that published the STAP papers, also began investigating the studies around the same time. The journal has declined to elaborate until its review is complete.In the meantime, Obokata and two of her RIKEN colleagues published a more detailed explanation of their research methods on Nature’s Protocol Exchange website to address some of the questions that have been raised.In late February, Wakayama told Knoepfler he was not surprised that other research groups hadn’t been able to make STAP stem cells yet. (Even he’s had trouble reproducing the study results since he left RIKEN and set up his new lab at the University of Yamanashi.)“It is going to take time to reproduce the new technique,” Wakayama said in a Q&A posted on Knoepfler’s blog. “For example, the first cloned animal, Dolly, wasn’t reproduced for one and half years after it was published. Human cloned ES cell paper [published in May 2013] has still not yet been reproduced. Therefore, please wait at least one year. I believe that during this period someone or myself will success to reproduce it.”That optimism may be gone now. At Monday’s news conference, Japan News quoted Wakayama as saying, ""I’m no longer sure that the articles are correct.”Obokata, who became a national celebrity in Japan after the papers were published, has not addressed the controversy. But one of her coauthors, Dr. Charles Vacanti of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, told the Boston Globe he still believes the STAP findings are sound.“I think there were some simple, perhaps sloppy mistakes that I thought were honest mistakes,” said Vacanti, whose name is on both Nature papers and was also the senior author of the 2011 report in Tissue Engineering. “I don’t have any information that would make me change my opinion of what I said before.” Harvard Medical School is looking into the matter as well, according to Japan News.If you're interested in the latest scientific and medical studies, you like the things I write about.

509	"After claiming to have developed a novel technique for coaxing the growth of stem cells in an acid bath, Japanese researchers have come under scrutiny for apparent irregularities. In the latest twist, one of the paper's coauthors has admitted that the study should be retracted. A potential Nobel-winning stem-cell study is now under investigation for irregularities. Haruko…Soon after the paper was published, it was criticized for irregularities and apparent duplicated images. More importantly, nobody could replicate the results claimed by the team, one led by Haruko Obokata of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan. But now, as Nature News reports, two more serious problems have emerged.First, the paper was found to contain two images that appear to have been duplicated from Obokata's doctoral dissertation. What's more, the study described experiments with cells in an embryonic state, but the cells reported in the paper were said to be derived from an entirely different process from a different experiment. Ouch. Second, there's the recent admission from Teruhiko Wakayama, a cloning expert at Yamanashi University and a corresponding author on one of the papers. From Nature News: Interviewed by NHK news, Wakayama said: ""I have lost faith in the paper. Overall there are now just too many uncertainties about it. I think we have to wait for some confirmation."" Wakayama calls for an investigation of all the laboratory notebooks and data. He continues: ""To check the legitimacy of the paper, we should retract it, prepare proper data and images, and then use those to demonstrate, with confidence, that the paper is correct.""

513	"A co-author of a Japanese study that promised a revolutionary way to create stem cells has called for the headline-grabbing research to be retracted over claims its data was faulty.The findings, published by Japanese researcher Haruko Obokata and US-based scientists, outlined a simple and low-tech approach in the quest to grow transplant tissue in the lab.The study was touted as the third great advance in stem cells -- a futuristic field that aims to reverse Alzheimer's, cancer and other crippling or lethal diseases.But it faced hard questions as the Japan-based Riken institute, which sponsored the study, launched a probe last month over the credibility of data used in the explosive findings.At issue are allegations that researchers used erroneous image data for an article published in the January edition of British journal Nature.Teruhiko Wakayama, a Yamanashi University professor who co-authored the article, called for a retraction.""It's hard to believe the findings anymore after so many mistakes in the data,"" he told broadcaster Nippon Television late Monday.On Tuesday, the institute said it was mulling whether to pull back the study.""We are considering whether to retract the report based on its credibility and research ethics, even though our investigation is still underway,"" it said.In an e-mailed statement, the journal said: ""Issues relating to this paper have been brought to Nature's attention and we are conducting an ongoing investigation. We have no further comment at this stage.""But Hitoshi Niwa, who also contributed to the article, dismissed what he described as minor mistakes, Japanese media reported.Another co-author, Charles Vacanti, a tissue engineer at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told the Wall Street Journal: ""It would be very sad to have such an important paper retracted as a result of peer pressure, when indeed the data and conclusions are honest and valid.""Harvard is also investigating, reports said.  -- Simple, low-cost technique? --Hakubun Shimomura, the Japanese minister in charge of science and education, said Tuesday that the study should be retracted now and re-published it if ""they accumulate new facts"" that prove its authenticity.Called stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) cells, the innovation was touted as breaking new ground, supplying a lower-cost and relatively straightforward technique. Stem cells are primitive cells that, as they grow, become differentiated into the various specialised cells that make up the different organs -- the brain, the heart, kidney and so on.The goal is to create stem cells in the lab and nudge them to grow into these differentiated cells, thus replenishing organs damaged by disease or accident.The researchers' groundbreaking findings said that white blood cells in newborn mice were returned to a versatile state through a relatively simple process that involved incubating them in a highly acidic solution for 25 minutes, followed by a five-minute spin in a centrifuge and week-long immersion in a growth culture.Until now, only plant cells, and not mammal cells, have been found to reprogramme back to a youthful state through simple environmental factors.A key obstacle in the field is ensuring that transplanted cells are not attacked as alien by the body's immune system -- meaning they would have to carry a patient's own genetic code to identify them as friendly.In 1998 came the first gain: the use of cloning technology -- pioneered with Dolly the sheep -- to harvest stem cells from early-stage embryos grown from the donor's own DNA.But these ""pluripotent"" stem cells are controversial as the method entails destroying the embryo, something opposed by religious conservatives and others.In 2006, a team led by Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University, who was a co-recipient of the 2012 Nobel Prize for Medicine, created so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS).The team took mature cells and coded them with four genes, ""rewinding"" the cells' genetic programmes to return them to a juvenile state.The technique had to overcome an early hurdle of causing tumours in cells and still faces efficiency problems -- less than one percent of adult cells are typically reprogrammed successfully."

514	"Japan’s Riken research center is planning to withdraw two controversial stem cell studies which were published in the journal Nature in January. The research papers were under intense scrutiny and now the Japanese researchers are planning to retract the studies which revealed that ordinary cells from mice can be transformed into potent stem cells by receiving acidic stress. The Japanese research team wants to withdraw the studies due to some errors.Haruko Obokata, researcher at Riken Center for Developmental Biology, who published two studies and Teruhiko Wakayama, Professor at University of Yamanashi, said their studies described simple version of reprogramming mature cells into younger versions.
“I’m no longer sure that the articles are correct,” Teruhiko Wakayama said at a press conference held in Japan.Their studies resulted in the process of reprogramming human cells into Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency (STAP) cells. These cells would further be used to replace and heal damaged cells or organs in sick people.Riken said that the novel technique would help in reprogramming cells and in generating stem cells without adding any genes.Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, has issued new guidelines and passed bills to enhance leadership in field of research. Researchers said that it is possible to change embryonic cells at their early age, called as pluripotent, but as the embryo develops, it becomes difficult to differentiate with each other.They added that there are different ways to regenerate pluripotent stem cells.

515	Teruhiko Wakayama, a respected stem cell scientist from Japan’s RIKEN Institute, said he is not certain about the methods used in two studies he co-authored with lead investigator Haruko Obokata.In the ground-breaking work, heralded by some in the field as a game-changer in the way stem cells are made, Obokata and her team, which included researchers from Harvard University and other international institutes, detailed how they were able to coax already developed cells to revert back to an embryonic-like state to become stem cells by simply exposing them to chemical solutions (mostly acidic) or physical stress. Stem cells can be manipulated to develop into any of the body’s tissues to repair or replace diseased cells.The controversy erupted when Obokata and her team published a tips sheet for other researchers to follow to replicate their work. But inconsistencies between the newly released methods and the original protocol in the papers, as well as questions about images in the published work, led some to wonder about the validity of the results. Wakayama himself said he was able to repeat the study only once, with Obokata’s assistance, but not on his own.MORE: The Rise and Fall of the Cloning KingIn a press conference in Japan last month, Wakayama, who is best known for using stem cell techniques to clone mice, said he asked all of the scientists involved to retract the papers, which were published in the journal Nature in January, and to have the data and results reviewed by other scientists. RIKEN is investigating the work, as is Nature.The development adds another black eye to the field of stem cell science, which is ripe with possibility but has struggled to establish its credibility. In 2006, Korean researcher Woo Suk Hwang claimed he had become the first to successfully “clone” human cells, generating patient-specific lines of stem cells from a person’s skin cell. The work turned out to be fraudulent, and the stem cells derived from an already established technique of extracting them from existing embryos.Since then, both policy makers and those in the field have been more skeptical of milestone claims – for good reason, as the latest study shows.

518	"Japanese member of research team makes plea after other experts could not replicate findingsComments:  A Japanese scientist has called for his own headline-grabbing study on stem cells to be withdrawn from publication, saying its findings had now been thrown into too much doubt.The research - hailed when it came out in January as a breakthrough that could herald a new era of medical biology - was covered around the world after it was published in the respected science journal Nature.But since then, there have been reports that other scientists have been unable to replicate the Japanese team's results and that there may have been problems with its data and images.""It is no longer clear what is right,"" Teruhiko Wakayama, a professor at Japan's University of Yamanashi who was part of the researcher team, told public broadcaster NHK yesterday.The study, hailed as game changing by independent experts when it was published, appeared to show a simple way to reprogramme mature animal cells back into an embryonic-like state that would allow them to generate many types of tissue.The results appeared to offer a promise that human cells might in future be simply and cheaply reprogrammed back into embryonic cell-like cells - in this case cells dubbed Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency, or STAP, cells - suggesting a simple way to replace damaged cells or grow new organs for sick and injured people.""When conducting the experiment, I believed it was absolutely right,"" Wakayama said.""But now that many mistakes have emerged, I think it is best to withdraw the research paper once and, using correct data and correct pictures, to prove once again the paper is right.

A Japanese scientist involved in the stem cell study, which many hailed as a “game-changer,” has expressed his desire to retract his research. The research was published in the highly regarded science journal Nature, and was considered a major breakthrough that would usher a new era in medical biology when it came out.Teruhiko Wakayama, a professor at the University of Yamanashi and a member of the research team that studied stem cells, described their discovery now as doubtful. “It is no longer clear what is right,” he said. When the study came out, it described a simple method to reprogram mature animal cells to a younger version. Its embryonic-like state would make it feasible for the cell to generate different kinds of tissue. The results seemed to show a way to reprogram human cells in the future without any complex processes and expensive methods into Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency (STAP) cells, which could be used to replace and heal damaged cells or organs for sick people. Wakayama felt at that time that his experiment was correct. This time, he doubts the accuracy of the experiment saying, “But now that many mistakes have emerged, I think it is best to withdraw the research paper once and, using correct data and correct pictures, to prove once again the paper is right. If it turns out to be wrong, we would need to make it clear why a thing like this happened.” An official from the journal Nature has confirmed that certain “issues relating to the paper” are being looked at by the publication. Meanwhile, Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell expert at Britain’s National Institute for Medical Research remains positive on the research. Lovell-Badge is keeping “an open mind” on the issue and was said to be waiting for other stem cell labs from other countries to see if they can replicate the method. Researchers from Harvard Medical school, Brigham and Women’s Hospital along with other Japanese scientists have taken skin and blood cells to be subjected to stress “almost to the point of death” with the use of trauma, low oxygen levels and acidic environments. Cells placed under an acidic solution seemed to have survived and returned to a state, which resembles embryonic stem cell. However, other experiments were unable to reproduce the same results. This prompted the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Japan to investigate the contents of the paper with the help of experts working in and outside the center to validate the research.[via CBS News]

532	TOKYO — One of the authors of a study that was claimed to have discovered a simple way to make stem cells said Monday that he was no longer sure of his team’s conclusions, and he called for the study to be retracted.The study, laid out in two papers published by Nature in January surprised scientists around the world by finding that a simple acid bath might turn cells in the body into multipurpose stem cells. The new technique could be a quicker and easier source of stem cells than methods now in use, the authors said.But Monday, Teruhiko Wakayama, a professor of developmental engineering at the University of Yamanashi and one of the study’s co-authors, told NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, that a series of concerns raised in recent weeks by researchers around the world had shaken his belief in the study’s findings.“There are too many overall issues that I am not sure about. I am increasingly uncertain,” Wakayama told NHK.The new technique was developed by researchers at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, and at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Haruko Obokata, the 30-year-old lead writer of the study’s two papers and a rising star in Japan’s scientific community, has become an overnight celebrity here and a symbol of the rising stature of female scientists.Still, some experts quickly expressed caution, saying more needed to be known about the new approach. Caution turned to skepticism as researchers reported trouble in replicating the study’s results. Some of the photos used in the study were then called into question, as was wording that was found to be similar to that in an article published by different researchers almost a decade ago. Those questions prompted both Riken and Nature to begin separate investigations into the study’s integrity last month.Wakayama said that the numerous questions raised left the authors with little choice but to retract the paper.—Hiroko Tabuchi, The New York TimesPeter Lanza had not seen his son Adam for two years before the day Adam walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and killed 20 schoolchildren and six adults. Since that morning, Lanza cannot go an hour without thinking about his child. And now, he says, he wishes his son had never been born.“You can’t get any more evil,” he said in his first public comments since the shooting. “How much do I beat up on myself about the fact that he’s my son? A lot.”In a series of emotionally wrenching interviews with the writer Andrew Solomon, Lanza detailed his son’s medical history and increasing isolation, his ex-wife’s struggle to deal with their troubled child, and his own role as the father of the person who committed one of the worst mass shootings in the nation’s history.Solomon, the author of the book “Far From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity,” recounts the interviews in an article in this week’s issue of The New Yorker magazine.Adam Lanza, 20, shot his mother, Nancy, before going on his shooting rampage at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, 2012, and then shot himself just as the police were arriving at the elementary school.Peter Lanza’s account confirms the basic portrait that emerged from the investigation, and adds new details as well as a deeper understanding of how he and Adam’s mother struggled to understand and care for their son. Lanza described Adam’s behavior as a child as “weird” but never dangerous. He said that the first official diagnosis they received concerning Adam’s mental health came when he was 13.The diagnosis was Asperger’s syndrome, a category that the American Psychiatric Association has since subsumed into the broader diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder. Adam refused to accept that he had the disorder. Peter Lanza said that the diagnosis might have kept them from realizing the danger their son posed.—Marc Santora, The New York Times The Syrian civil war’s effect on the health of Syria’s children is far more insidious than has been widely understood, a leading children’s advocacy group reported Sunday, with large numbers dying or at risk from chronic and preventable diseases that have flourished because the country’s public health system has basically collapsed.In a report timed to coincide with the beginning of the fourth year of the conflict, the group, Save the Children, said the effects of untreated illnesses on Syrian children were only partly reflected in the documented statistics.They show that at least 1.2 million children have fled to neighboring countries, that 4.3 million in Syria need humanitarian assistance and that more than 10,000 have died in the violence.“It is not just the bullets and the shells that are killing and maiming children,” said the report, “A Devastating Toll.” The conflict, which began in March 2011, has left a “shattered health system resulting in brutal medical practices that have left millions of children suffering,” the report said.The report asserted that “several thousands of children” had died because of greatly reduced access to treatment for diseases including cancer, epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney failure. The report is based partly on conclusions drawn from data that has been issued by other organizations, including the United Nations and the World Health Organization, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Doctors Without Borders, and other medical research, as well as from the Syrian government.But the report also draws on Save the Children’s own research, including interviews with Syrian children, parents and medical providers who painted what amounted to a portrait of medieval health conditions.—Rick Gladstone, The New York Times 	Health

	A Japanese scientist called on Monday for his own headline-grabbing study on stem cells to be withdrawn from publication, saying its findings had now been thrown into too much doubt.
	The research - hailed when it came out in January as a breakthrough that could herald a new era of medical biology - was covered widely in Japan and across the world after it was published in the highly reputable science journal Nature.
	But since then, there have been reports that other scientists have been unable to replicate the Japanese team's results and that there may have been problems with its data and images.
	""It is no longer clear what is right,"" Teruhiko Wakayama, a professor at Japan's University of Yamanashi who was part of the researcher team, told public broadcaster NHK.
	The study, described as game changing by independent experts asked to comment on it when it was published, appeared to show a simple way to reprogram mature animal cells back into an embryonic-like state that would allow them to generate many types of tissue.
	The results appeared to offer a promise that human cells might in future be simply and cheaply reprogrammed back into embryonic cell-like cells - in this case cells dubbed Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency, or STAP, cells - suggesting a simple way to replace damaged cells or grow new organs for sick and injured people.
	""When conducting the experiment, I believed it was absolutely right,"" Wakayama said.
	""But now that many mistakes have emerged, I think it is best to withdraw the research paper once and, using correct data and correct pictures, to prove once again the paper is right. If it turns out to be wrong, we would need to make it clear why a thing like this happened.""
	A Nature spokesperson said ""issues relating to this paper"" had been brought to the journal's attention and it was conducting an investigation, but made no further comment.
	Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell expert at Britain's National Institute for Medical Research, cautioned against premature assumptions on whether the research was flawed.
	""I have an open mind on this,"" he told Reuters. ""I'm waiting to hear from several serious stem cell labs around the world on whether they have been able to reproduce the methods.""
	Wakayama's co-researcher Haruko Obokata, became an instant celebrity in Japan after she spoke during a Nature media briefing to science reporters all over the world about her eye-catching findings.
	The Japanese researchers, joined by others from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in the United States, took skin and blood cells, let them multiply, then subjected them to stress ""almost to the point of death"", they explained, by exposing them to various events including trauma, low oxygen levels and acidic environments.
	One of these ""stressful"" situations was simply to bathe the cells in a weak acid solution for around 30 minutes. Within days, the scientists said they had found that the cells had not only survived but had also recovered by naturally reverting into a state similar to that of an embryonic stem cell.
	Yet no other research team has yet been able to replicate the findings, and the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Japan, where Obokata works, said last week it had ""launched an independent inquiry into the content of the paper.
	That inquiry would be conducted by a panel of experts from within and outside RIKEN, it said, and would be published as soon as it was concluded.
	A RIKEN spokesman declined to comment on Wakayama's call for the paper to be withdrawn.

537	According to Japanese news reports, a respected scientist and co-author of two high-profile papers that described a controversial technique for creating stem cells has called for the studies to be withdrawn because of errors. For weeks, the papers published in the journal Nature by a team of Boston and Japanese scientists have been under intense scrutiny, which has revealed problems with some of the images  and an allegation of plagiarism in the Methods section of one of the papers. The researcher who is calling for the retraction, Teruhiko Wakayama, is a highly-respected stem cell scientist who was the first to clone a mouse. His involvement with the papers was one of the key reasons that outside scientists who were skeptical of the stunningly simple method -- dipping mature cells in an acid bath to turn them into stem cells -- took it seriously. “I’m no longer sure that the articles are correct,” Wakayama said at a press conference given Monday evening in Japan, according to The Japan News. Wakayama told another news agency, NHK World, that he is now not sure the cells he was given by his coauthors, to check whether they could develop into any cell in the body, were truly created by the technique reported. “He said he is convinced his experiments were correct, but is no longer sure about the credibility of the data used as preconditions for the experiments,” NHK World reported.Last week, the RIKEN Institute in Japan, where many of the scientists involved in the studies work, released a detailed protocol explaining how to make the cells. It was an effort to clarify a situation that has been increasingly murky, because of doubts raised about whether the work was repeatable. Even Wakayama told Nature News that although he was able to do the procedure successfully once, with help from the lead author, Haruko Obokata, he has not since been able to repeat the experiment on his own. But the protocol itself raised many questions. Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell scientist at the University of California, Davis, whose blog has become a resource for information about the technique, described what appeared to be contradictions and red flags. Wakayama told NHK World that his review of data brought to meetings revealed many serious problems, including some with images. The news agency reported that he has asked the entire team to retract the papers and then have the work reviewed by outside scientists.Wakayama did not respond immediately to an e-mail, but Dr. Charles Vacanti of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the senior author of the paper describing the technique for creating stem cells, said he only learned about Wakayama’s request Monday morning, through news reports.“I’ve not communicated with him yet. This is the first I’ve heard of it. I have zero information,” Vacanti said. He said that he still stands behind the papers, and that so far the problems with the papers have been errors that do nothing to endanger the overall result.“I think there were some simple, perhaps sloppy mistakes that I thought were honest mistakes,” Vacanti said. “I don’t have any information that would make me change my opinion of what I said before.”An investigation into the papers has been ongoing at the RIKEN Institute, where Obokata, the lead author of both of the papers, works. Obokata did not immediately respond to an e-mail.In a statement, the journal said the investigation is not complete.“Issues relating to the papers have been brought to Nature’s attention and we are conducting an on-going investigation. We have no further comment at this stage,” a spokeswoman for Nature wrote in an e-mail. © 2018 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC	Health

News blog10 Mar 2014 | 16:00 GMT | Posted by David Cyranoski | Category: Biology & Biotechnology, Ethics, stem cells Less than 40 days after a team led by Haruko Obokata of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, presented two stunning papers claiming a method of using a simple acid-bath method to reprogramme mature mammalian cells back to an embryonic state — so called STAP cells — researchers in Japan, including one of the papers’ co-authors, are calling for them to be retracted.Within weeks of their 30 January publication, the paper was criticized for irregularities and apparent duplicated images. Numerous scientists also had difficulty reproducing the supposedly simple method. The team responded with the promise of corrections and a list of tips to help other scientists to reproduce the results.Over the weekend, however, two more serious problems surfaced. The Nature paper was found to contain two images apparently duplicated from Obokata’s doctoral dissertation. Her thesis also reported experiments dealing with cells that were supposedly in an embryonic state, but the cells reported in the Nature paper were said to be derived from a different process in an altogether different experiment.The revelation has led to a flurry of calls — including some from senior scientists in Japan — for the paper to be retracted.Perhaps the most damning comes from Teruhiko Wakayama, a cloning expert at Yamanashi University and a corresponding author on one of the papers. Interviewed by NHK news, Wakayama said: “I have lost faith in the paper. Overall there are now just too many uncertainties about it. I think we have to wait for some confirmation.” Wakayama calls for an investigation of all the laboratory notebooks and data. He continues: “To check the legitimacy of the paper, we should retract it, prepare proper data and images, and then use those to demonstrate, with confidence, that the paper is correct.” Wakayama reportedly contacted all of the authors requesting that they agree to retract the paper. RIKEN says it is still investigating the case. 12 Mar 2014 03:56 GMT

	I can’t believe this is a fake! You should be so naive to do something like this!
Also, I still respect Japanese people and I trust them more than I would trust American people!
If I should choose between a “made in Japan” or a “made in USA (or China, it’s the same)” thing I would still choose Japan, because I’m sure it will work!!!12 Mar 2014 17:57 GMT

	I feel that it would be great if Nature would find a way to publish the reviewers’ comments on this manuscript as well as the editorial procedure. As long as the reviewers agree, it could be very beneficial. For instance, it might enable the community to see where things went awry in finding the concerns that have been discussed since the publication of these studies.
It has been the common practice in EMBO since 2009, (linked here – http://bit.ly/1iAVP5i). As it might be problematic to apply this policy retrospectively, this case enhances the need to adopt this model going forward.Comments are closed.BlogrollBlogrollBlogrollBlogrollBlogroll

linked to a higher risk of bearing a preterm or unexpectedly small baby, even if expectant 

mothers keep within the government-recommended limit of two units a week.In addition, say researchers at the University of Leeds in the UK, who report their findings in the 

BMJ's Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,  drinking alcohol in the weeks 

leading up to conception is also linked to smaller fetal growth.The new finding adds to a debate, fueled by mixed evidence, that has been going on for some 

time about light alcohol consumption in pregnancy.The authors note that when pregnant women drink alcohol, it crosses the placenta and results in nearly equal cocentrations in both the fetus and the mother.However, while the effects of heavy drinking in pregnancy are well established, the effect of light drinking is not, and different studies have come to different conclusions about it, as have different health authorities.For example, in 2010, the same journal published a study led by University College London, which tracked children up to the age of 5 and found no evidence that light drinking in 

pregnancy harms children's development.But in 2012, researchers in the US who were concerned about fetal alcohol syndrome - a range of 

growth, mental and physical abnormalities that can occur in babies whose mothers drink alcohol 

during pregnancy - said there was no safe limit for alcohol consumption 

in pregnancy. They described how they came to this conclusion in a paper published in the  

journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.And then, a year later, another UK study published in BMJ Open looked at the 

effects drinking during pregnancy might have on fetal development and concluded that moderate alcohol consumption in 

pregnancy was safe.Meanwhile, American women are advised by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that there is no safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy, and that women who are pregnant or 

plan on becoming pregnant should refrain from drinking alcohol.This is also the view of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, which 

recommend universal screening for alcohol consumption for all pregnant women and women of 

childbearing age.The UK's Department of Health advice is less strict. They recommend women who are pregnant or 

trying to conceive should not drink alcohol at all, but if they choose to drink, then they 

should limit their consumption to one or two units, once or twice a week. That is no more than a 

pint of beer, or a medium glass of wine, twice a week.For this latest study, the Leeds researchers examined data on 1,264 pregnant women in Leeds 

aged between 18 and 25 who were assessed to be at low risk for birth complications.All the women were enrolled in the Caffeine and Reproductive Health (CARE) Study, and had 

filled in food frequency questionnaires that asked them to specify how often they drank alcohol 

and of what type, 4 weeks before conception and during each trimester throughout their 

pregnancy.When their babies were born, 13% were underweight and 4.4% were smaller than would be 

expected, while a similar percentage (4.3%) were preterm.Even after taking into account other possible influencers, when they analyzed the alcohol 

data against the birth outcomes, the researchers found women who drank more than two units of 

alcohol per week were twice as likely to give birth to a premature or unexpectedly small baby 

than women who did not drink alcohol at all.But the analysis showed that even women who did not drink more than the maximum recommended alcohol intake during this period were still at increased risk of giving birth prematurely.Plus, drinking during the period leading up to conception was also associated with a risk of 

restricted fetal growth, suggesting this may also be a critical time, note the authors.The data showed that on average, the women drank the most alcohol before conception and in the 

first trimester. During pregnancy, the average intake was 11 units a week in the first, four in the 

second, and just under two in the last trimester.More than half (53%) of the moms-to-be drank more than two units a week in the first trimester, 

and nearly 40% said they drank more than 10 units a week in the weeks leading up to 

conception.The study also found expectant mothers who were the most likely to drink more than the 

recommended limit of two units a week tended to be older, white, better educated and living in 

more affluent areas.Senior author Janet Cade, a professor in Leeds' School of Science and Food Nutrition, 

says:""Since pregnancy is such a special time for women it would be sensible for anyone who is 

thinking about getting pregnant to avoid alcohol during that time.""

541	"LEEDS, England, March 11 (UPI) --  Pregnant women who drank more than two weekly units of alcohol were twice as likely to give birth to a small or premature baby, researchers in Britain say. A 15-ounce can of beer which is 4.5 percent alcohol is 2 units of alcohol, while a single shot of spirits is 1 unit of alcohol, explained the website www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/alcohol-units.aspx.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
Professor Janet Cade of the University of Leeds' School of Science and Food Nutrition and colleagues linked women drinking alcohol -- just two weekly units of alcohol -- during the first three months of pregnancy to a higher risk of having a premature or unexpectedly small baby.The research also found those who drank more than two units a week were more likely to be older, were college educated, of white ethnicity and more likely to live in affluent areas.Britain's Department of Health recommends pregnant women, or those trying to conceive, to not drink alcohol at all. But, if they chose to drink, the government's advice is to not have more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week, Cade said. However, the study found even women who didn't exceed the maximum recommended alcohol intake during this period were still at increased risk of a premature birth. Drinking alcohol during the period leading up to conception was also linked to a higher risk of lower fetal growth, Cade said. The study involved 1,200 women in Leeds, England, at low risk of birth complications. All the women were part of the Caffeine and Reproductive Health study, looking for links between diet and birth outcomes.The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found 13 percent of the babies born were underweight, and 4.4 percent were smaller than would be expected. A similar proportion, 4.3 percent, were born prematurely. Drinking during the first three months of pregnancy was most strongly linked to these outcomes, the researchers said.

		Thursday 25 January 20186:00PM GMT 11 Mar 2014 More than half of women drink more than the recommended limits during the first three months of pregnancy, a study suggests.  Some 53% of women drank more than the upper limit of two units a week during the first trimester, figures show. Middle class women are more likely than women from other classes to drink more than the recommended limits during pregnancy, researchers said.  They called for health officials to revise their guidance on drinking in pregnancy after their study showed that even those adhering to the suggested limits are more likely to have problems with their babies than those who do not drink at all.  The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, examined 1,200 women in Leeds who filled out food frequency questionnaires, including information on alcohol consumption during the month before conception and the three trimesters of pregnancy.  They noted that alcohol intake was ""significantly higher"" before conception, and during the first three months of pregnancy than in the last two trimesters. Related Content Dr Patrick O'Brien, spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said: ""The findings suggest that even small amounts of alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy may increase the risk of a small impairment to the baby's growth and possibly premature birth.  ""This is consistent with RCOG advice that if a woman falls pregnant she should abstain from alcohol during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy because this is a particularly sensitive time for the baby's development.  ""However, while the safest approach would be to choose not to drink at all, small amounts of alcohol, not more than one to two units once or twice a week, have not been shown to be harmful after 12 weeks of pregnancy.  ""Pregnant women should always consult their midwives or doctors if they have any concerns about their alcohol intake.""  Source: ITN / PA More Video

544	"ATLANTA (CBS Atlanta) – The findings of a recent study suggest that middle-class mothers-to-be are more likely to imbibe alcohol while pregnant than women from any other economic tier.The UK Telegraph is reporting that college-educated, mature white women from affluent areas were the most prone to ignoring medical advise on the matter.“Our findings suggest that women should be advised to abstain from alcohol when planning to conceive and throughout pregnancy,” researchers were quoted as saying.Those involved in the study also asserted that their findings “highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said that there is “no safe time to drink during pregnancy and no safe kind of alcohol to drink while pregnant.”“[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders] … can affect each person in different ways, and can range from mild to severe,” officials noted on the CDC website, before adding that there is no cure for any of the disorders caused by consuming alcohol while pregnant.A reported 1,264 women completed questionnaires that asked about their alcohol consumption habits throughout their pregnancies, allowing researchers to reach their conclusions.Experts also found that those who drank during the first trimester were especially likely to have children who were born prematurely or with low birth weights.“It is interesting that alcohol consumption was greatest in women from a strong economic and social background who should otherwise have the lowest risk of preterm birth and low birth weight,” Prof Andrew Whitelaw, Professor of Neonatal Medicine, University of Bristol, told the Telegraph. “This is further evidence that even moderate amounts of alcohol are toxic to the growing foetus and direct toxicity is further worsened by the increased complications of premature birth.”He continued: “As 38 per cent of the women admitted risky drinking (over 10 units/week) before pregnancy and pregnancy is sometimes discovered late, the advice has to be to avoid alcohol completely when trying to conceive.”The study was published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment: You are commenting using your Twitter account.

547	"Recent trends suggesting that pregnant women can drink small amounts of alcohol may soon be sputtering to an end, with a new study finding that the women who do indulge in the odd tipple are more likely to give birth to underweight or preemie babies.More than just two units of alcohol per week in the first trimester - equivalent to a can of full-strength beer - were found to be enough to prompt birth complications. The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, was conducted by British researchers who surveyed the alcohol consumption habits of 1,264 women both prior to conception and during pregnancy. The women were participants in the Caffeine and Reproductive Health study, and all at low risk of birth complications. The survey asked respondents to provide information on the dietary habits, including, of course, alcohol intake.Contrary to the recommendations of the British Department of Health, which suggests no more than one to two units of alcohol per week, more than 53 percent of participants drank more than two units per week. In America, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns pregnant women off alcohol altogether.It was then found that 13 percent of the babies born during the study were underweight at the time of birth, while 4.4 percent fell into the 'low birth weight' range. Premature babies accounted for 4.3 percent of the births. On average, alcohol consumption over the recommended amount during the first trimester was found to be linked a 100 gram reduction in birth weight. ""This is further evidence that even moderate amounts of alcohol are toxic to the growing fetus and direct toxicity is further worsened by the increased complications of premature birth,"" said Professor Andrew Whitelaw of the University of Bristol, who was not affiliated with the study. ""As 38% of the women admitted risky drinking (over 10 units/week) before pregnancy and pregnancy is sometimes discovered late, the advice has to be to avoid alcohol completely when trying to conceive.""The survey also found that women typically drank 11.2 units of alcohol in the months preceding the pregnancy, and four units per week during the first three months with child. The women who drank more were also found to be more affluent, older, and tertiary educated.Sign up for our email newsletter today.Tech Times' biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.By clicking on 'Submit' button above, you confirm that you accept Tech Times Terms & ConditionsMedicineAncientEarth/EnvironmentVideo GamesVideo Games

548	"Drinking alcohol during the first three months of pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of premature birth or ""unexpectedly small babies.""The U.K. Department of Health recommends completely cutting out alcohol during pregnancy and even when trying to conceive; most middle-aged women drink more than this, a British Medical Journal news release reported.The research team looked at 1,264 questionnaires taken by women who had a low risk of birth complications. The mothers were asked how often they consumed alcohol and what kind they drank at four different points in time: ""in the four weeks before conception; and in each of the subsequent three months (trimesters) throughout the pregnancy"" the news release reported.The researchers found alcohol consumption was significantly higher before conception and in the first three months of pregnancy than in the last two trimesters. The rate of consumption averaged at 11 units per week before conception; four during early pregnancy; and under two during the later trimesters.The U.K. Department of Health includes abstaining for alcohol during pregnancy, but recommends no more than two units per week. Fifty-three percent of the women in the study consumed over that recommended weekly maximum during the first trimester. About four out of 10 women admitted they drank more than 10 units a week while trying to conceive.Those who drank more than two units per week were more likely to be ""older, educated to degree level, of white ethnicity, and more likely to live in affluent areas,"" the news release reported.The team found a significant link between alcohol consumption during the first three weeks of pregnancy and an increased risk of premature or underweight birth.  Even women who did not exceed the recommended two units per week maximum still had an increased risk of these complications. Drinking while trying to conceive was also associated with ""restricted fetal growth.""""Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period,"" the authors wrote, the news release reported. "	Health

                                    Women who consumed low levels of alcohol before conception and during pregnancy were more likely to have adverse birth outcomes such as low birth centile, low birth weight, and premature birth than nondrinkers, a British study reported.In the first trimester, consuming less than 2 units of alcohol per week was associated with an adjusted -5.8 (95% CI -10.8 to -0.7) decrease in customized birth centile compared with nondrinkers (Ptrend = 0.002), wrote Camilla Nykjaer, MSc, of the University of Leeds and her co-authors in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. (A unit of alcohol was defined as 10 mL by volume or 8 grams by weight.)Ingesting more than 2 units a week was associated with an adjusted -8.2 (95% CI -12.6 to -3.7) decrease in customized birth centile compared with nondrinkers (Ptrend = 0.002).Consuming more than two units of alcohol per week in the month before conception was associated with a -7.7 (95% CI -12.8 to -2.6) decrease in customized birth centile (adjusted Ptrend=0.009) compared with nondrinkers, they wrote. (Customized birth centiles took into account maternal height, weight, ethnicity, parity, neonatal birth weight, and sex.The adjusted odds ratios for small gestational age in the first trimester were 1.7 for those who drank less than 2 units a week (95% CI 0.9 to 3.1) and 2.0 for those who consumed more than two units a week compared with nondrinkers (95% CI 1.2 to 3.4, Ptrend= 0.03).The low birth centile and small gestational age associations were ""attenuated"" in the second and third trimesters, the authors reported.The adjusted odds ratios for giving birth prematurely were 4.6 for women who drank less than two units of alcohol a week (95% CI 1.4 to 14.7) and 3.5 for those who drank more than two units a week (95% CI 1.1 to 11.2), compared with nondrinkers, they added.This association was ""nonsignificant"" in those who drank in the 4 weeks before conception and during the second and third trimester, the authors said.The study included 1,264 pregnant women between 18 and 45 enrolled in the Caffeine and Reproductive Health (CARE) Study. Their alcohol consumption was gauged based on questionnaires administered 4 weeks before conception and during each trimester.The questionnaires asked how often participants drank alcohol and what forms of alcohol they drank. Frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption was converted to times per week, which was then multiplied by the units of alcohol in each of the alcoholic beverages listed on the questionnaire to obtain weekly consumption in units.Information on birth outcomes was obtained from hospital maternity records.The researchers adjusted for caffeine and energy intake, as well as salivary cotinine levels.Alcohol crosses the placenta ""and results in nearly equal concentrations in the mother and fetus,"" the authors noted. But while the evidence regarding the damaging effects of heavy drinking in pregnancy has been well-established, results of studies of the impact of low levels of alcohol consumption on birth outcomes have been varied.The lack of consensus on the impact of low levels of consumption has resulted in varying national policies with regard to alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the authors said.In the U.S., the Surgeon General has advised women against drinking alcohol during pregnancy. In the U.K., where the study took place, the Department of Health recommends that pregnant women and those trying to conceive avoid alcohol or limit consumption to one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week.The most recent U.K. Infant Feeding Survey (IFS), which included data from more than 15,000 women, indicated that 40% drank alcohol during their pregnancies, but that only 3% drank more than two units per week.In this study, the proportion of women who reported drinking before and during pregnancy was considerably higher, the authors said. ""Nearly two-thirds of women before pregnancy and over half in the first trimester reported alcohol intakes above the Department of Health (U.K.) guidelines of ≤2 units/week,"" they wrote.The IFS data was collected postpartum and might have been subject to under-reporting, the authors cautioned. The characteristics of drinking mothers in this study and the IFS survey were generally consistent, however  --  women tended to be 35 or older, from managerial and professional occupations, and from a white ethnic background.One potential weakness of the study was that it was designed to assess caffeine intake, not alcohol consumption. ""However, the questionnaire was validated with reference to caffeine intake and is comparable to other methods used in the assessment of alcohol,"" the authors said.The study also suffered from low sample size in the third trimester.""Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period,"" the authors wrote.Future studies should also take into account timing of exposure, the authors said. Maternal alcohol consumption usually decreases throughout pregnancy, they said. ""Therefore, averaging exposure measured at one time point in pregnancy to reflect exposure across the whole of pregnancy may obscure any true associations.""The CARE study was supported by a grant from the Food Standard Agency.

        Mothers-to-be should avoid alcohol, according to the study
        
        ""Drinking alcohol early in pregnancy, even in small amounts, increases the risk of harming your baby,"" reports The Independent, one of several news outlets to report on the latest study on the risks of drinking during pregnancy.The study of 1,303 pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years old found that women who drank less than two units a week during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy were at increased risk of complications, including premature birth.While the risk at the individual level is still low, researchers from the University of Leeds concluded that the first trimester was the most ""vulnerable period"" of a woman's pregnancy. They also found a more general association between drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy and worse birth outcomes, such as lower birth weight or foetal growth restriction.""Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes,"" say the study's authors.The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, suggests that women who are planning to conceive and who are pregnant should abstain from alcohol. However, for now it is unclear whether consideration of this study alongside other evidence will lead to a change to government recommendations on drinking during pregnancy. There currently remains some uncertainty around whether there is a safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, or whether it should be avoided altogether.The Department of Health recommends that pregnant women and women trying to conceive should avoid alcohol completely, and, if they choose to drink, should never drink more than one to two units once or twice a week and never get drunk. The most recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on Antenatal Care (2008) specifically advises that women trying to conceive, and those in the first three months of pregnancy, should avoid drinking alcohol, as this may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. The study was carried out by researchers from the University of Leeds and was funded by the Food Standards Agency. It was published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. The results of the research were well reported by BBC News and The Independent. The Daily Telegraph's headline about ""middle-class mothers' alcohol risk to babies"" was based on the finding that women reporting alcohol intake above two units per week were more likely to be older, have a university degree, be of European origin, and were less likely to live in a deprived area. However, the researchers did not conclude that ""middle-class mothers are at greater risk of having premature and smaller babies as they drink too much in pregnancy"", as the paper reports. This was a prospective cohort study carried out in Leeds that aimed to determine the association between alcohol intake before and during pregnancy with birth weight and gestational age. It also aimed to examine whether there was a different effect depending on the timing of exposure during pregnancy. There currently remains some uncertainty around whether there is a safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy or whether it should be avoided altogether.Cohort studies are the ideal study design to address this question. However, despite the fact that the researchers adjusted for a number of confounders, it is possible there are other factors that explain the association seen in the research. The researchers studied 1,303 pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years old.The women were asked about their alcohol consumption using food frequency questionnaires. The women completed the questionnaire three times:The reported frequency and type of alcohol drunk was used to calculate the units consumed per week.Based on their responses, women were categorised as non-drinking, drinking two or fewer units per week, or drinking more than two units per week.Birth outcomes were obtained from hospital maternal records. The primary outcome was birthweight, but the researchers also looked at birth centiles (birth size compared with other babies, adjusted for maternal height, weight, ethnicity, how many children she had, and the birthweight and gender of the baby), premature birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) and babies being small for gestational age (below the 10th growth centile).The researchers then looked at the association between drinking status and birth outcomes. They adjusted for confounders that included the mother's salivary cotinine (a biomarker of smoking status), pre-pregnancy weight, height, age, ethnicity, how many children she had, caffeine intake, and education. Approximately three-quarters of women before pregnancy and more than half in the first trimester reported alcohol intakes of more than two units per week. Just over a quarter of women reported drinking more than two units per week in the second or third trimester. Alcohol consumption four weeks before pregnancyDrinking more than two units per week four weeks before pregnancy was associated with lower birthweight (105.7g lower) and a 7.7 decrease in birth centile compared with not drinking. Drinking less than two units was not associated with lower birthweight or birth centile compared with not drinking.Alcohol consumption during the first trimester of pregnancy Drinking more than two units per week during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an approximate 100g reduction in birthweight and an 8.2 decrease in birth centile compared with not drinking. Drinking more than two units per week was associated with increased odds of having a baby small for its gestational age (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2 to 3.4) and a premature birth (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 11.2).Drinking two units or less per week during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an approximate 100g reduction in birthweight and a 5.8 decrease in birth centile compared with not drinking. Drinking two units or less per week was also associated with increased odds of having a preterm birth (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 14.7).Alcohol consumption during the second and third trimesters of pregnancyDrinking more than two units per week during the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with an approximate 100g reduction in birthweight, and during the third trimester of pregnancy was associated with an approximate 50g reduction in birthweight compared with not drinking.  The researchers concluded that, ""Maternal alcohol intake during the first trimester was found to have the strongest association with foetal growth and gestational age. Women who adhered to guidelines in this period were still at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes even after adjustment for known risk factors. ""Maternal alcohol intakes which exceeded the recommendations in the period leading up to pregnancy were also found to be associated with foetal growth, suggesting that the [period around conception] could be particularly sensitive to the effects of alcohol on the foetus. ""Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period."" This cohort study suggests that women who are planning to conceive and who are pregnant should abstain from alcohol. Drinking more than two units of alcohol per week was associated with adverse birth outcomes in all trimesters. In addition, the study found that women who reported limiting drinking to less than two units per week during the first trimester of pregnancy were also at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes.This study has the strength that it associated alcohol intake at three time points, covering different periods of pregnancy. Alcohol intake was assessed during pregnancy and not after birth, reducing the possibility of recall bias. In addition, it adjusted for a number of confounders and used an objective measure of smoking.However, the study was originally designed to assess the impact of caffeine intake on birth outcomes. Alcohol intake was self-reported, and there is the possibility of under-reporting. Few women had data on alcohol consumption in the third trimester (30% of the original cohort).Also, despite the fact that the researchers adjusted for a number of confounders, it is possible there are other factors that explain the association seen.This research provides further evidence for not drinking during pregnancy. However, for now it is unclear whether consideration of this study alongside other evidence will lead to a change in NICE or Department of Health recommendations around alcohol use during pregnancy. In the UK, the Department of Health currently recommends that pregnant women and women trying to conceive should avoid alcohol altogether, and, if they choose to drink, should never drink more than one to two units once or twice a week, and never get drunk. The most recent NICE guidance on Antenatal Care (2008) specifically advises that women trying to conceive, and those in the first three months of pregnancy, should avoid drinking alcohol, as this may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. After this, if women choose to drink during pregnancy they should drink no more than one to two units once or twice a week. NICE says that, ""Although there is uncertainty regarding a safe level of alcohol consumption in pregnancy, at this low level there is no evidence of harm to the unborn baby."" The organisation advises that getting drunk or binge drinking should be avoided throughout pregnancy, as this may be harmful to the unborn baby. Analysis by Bazian. Edited by NHS Choices.

552	"Home > ExpertsAccording to many government agencies, such as the United Kingdom Department of Health and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), women who are planning on conceiving or are already pregnant should ideally avoid consuming alcohol. Despite these recommendations, the U.K. guidelines suggest that if women want to drink, having no more than one or two units, equivalent to about one pint, per week should be safe. However, according to a new study conducted in the UK, researches reported that drinking alcohol anytime before or after conception increases one's risk of giving birth preterm.

For this study, the researchers interviewed 1,264 female participants. They gathered information on the participants' drinking patterns before and after conception. They calculated that 53 percent of the women had consumed more than the recommended weekly amount of alcohol within the first trimester. Almost 40 percent of the women reported drinking more than 10 units per week before conception.The researchers discovered that around 13 percent of the babies born to the study's participants were underweight. 4.4 percent of them were smaller than normal and 4.3 percent had been born preterm. The team estimated that women who drank more than two units within the first three months of pregnancy were two times more likely to give birth prematurely and to have a smaller than normal sized infant. The researchers also found that women who drank alcohol in general, even if the amount was below the limit of two units, were still more likely to have a premature or smaller infant than women who did not drink at all. The researcher reported the same relationship for women who drank more alcohol before conception.""This is a very sensitive issue, we don't want women who are pregnant now to panic, the individual risk is actually low,"" Camilla Nykjaer, one of the researchers at the University of Leeds, told the BBC News. ""They shouldn't drink, they should stop drinking if they have been drinking during the pregnancy.""The researchers noted that the women who were more likely to drink over the recommended amounts of alcohol tended to be white, older and more educated. They also resided in wealthier neighborhoods.""While the safest approach would be to choose not to drink at all, small amounts of alcohol, not more than one to two units once or twice a week, have not been shown to be harmful after 12 weeks of pregnancy,"" Dr. Patrick O'Brien, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said. ""Pregnant women should always consult their midwives or doctors if they have any concerns about their alcohol intake.""The study was published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.TagsPreterm, Pregnancy, Alcohol, Drinking, Women, conception, frequency, riskYou have already subscribed.

Few things attract such disparaging glares as a pregnant woman sidling up to the bar and ordering a martini. While studies may come to different conclusions on the topic, boozing and pregnancy are generally frowned upon in our society.

But new research from the University of Leeds has found that for a certain demographic, the rules of drinking while expecting a baby are being ignored, and that those babies are more at risk of being born small and premature.

Who were the defiant moms? Older, affluent white women with college degrees.

The researchers came to their conclusion by assessing responses to food frequency questionnaires completed by 1,264 British women at low risk of birth complications.

The U.K. Department of Health recommends that pregnant women – and those trying to conceive – should abstain from alcohol, or at the most, consume no more than one to two units a week. A unit is defined as 10 ml of pure alcohol, one to two units is equivalent to a glass of wine.

What the researchers found was that more than 50 percent of women in the white-affluent-educated socioeconomic class drank, on average, four units a week in their first trimester and only went down to two units or less in the second. Those who consumed more than the recommended two units a week were twice as likely to give birth to unexpectedly small or premature babies as women who abstained completely.

""Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period,"" the study notes. “Our findings suggest that women should be advised to abstain from alcohol when planning to conceive and throughout pregnancy.”

Drinking during the time before conception was also associated with smaller babies, indicating that this may also be a crucial period, suggest the authors.

“It is interesting that alcohol consumption was greatest in women from a strong economic and social background who should otherwise have the lowest risk of preterm birth and low birth weight,” said Andrew Whitelaw, professor of Neonatal Medicine at Leeds University.

“This is further evidence that even moderate amounts of alcohol are toxic to the growing fetus and direct toxicity is further worsened by the increased complications of premature birth,” he added.

The research was published online in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

555	Increase in risk of having premature births among pregnant women has been found in a study carried out by University of Leeds research team. Pregnant women who drink even less quantity of alcohol during first three weeks of pregnancy are at risk compared to women who do not drink at all. The Department of Health warns women to avoid drinking alcohol during their pregnancy and if the women want they are advised to take recommended amount of drinks i.e. not more than once or twice a week. But, recent research carried out over the past few years has revealed that taking even a small recommended amount of alcohol during pregnancy alters health of babies early or in their later life. A study on about 1,300 pregnant women have come up with findings that drinking alcohol during first trimester period of pregnancy puts worse effects on the development of fetus.The research published in the British Medical Journal advises pregnant women to avoid consuming alcohol when planning to conceive or during pregnancy. The survey conducted by researchers found impact of higher alcoholic consumption by pregnant women before conception period and during first three months of pregnancy compared to subsequent two trimesters.About 53% of women said that they drank more than the maximum recommended limit of two units per week during the first trimester with 40% said that they drank more than 10 units a week in the four weeks. Most surprising fact is that those women who drank more than two units a week were well educated and were residents of affluent areas of the city. Janet Cade, Professor at University of Leeds, said that such women were twice more likely to give birth to an unexpectedly small or premature babies compared to women who never drank alcohol. Researchers found that 13% of babies were underweight who were born to women who drank more than two units a week with 4.4% babies were smaller in size and 4.3% babies were born prematurely.Facebook, the most popular social-networking...Betting big on cruisers, the luxury motorcycle...Uber Technologies reported lower loss by nearly 9...The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is facing an increasingly...Luxury carmaker BMW’s next-generation M5 car will...Board members of the bankrupt Energy Future...© Copyright 2008 - Newstonight South Africa.

557	"Highlight PressBreaking Tech News, Entertainment, Mortgages and MoreMarch 11, 2014 By Meredith Hoster Respected physician speaks out against drinking alcohol while pregnant, stating that the only safe amount to consume is none at all. 
The debate as to how much alcohol pregnant women can safely consume has once again been kicked off this morning, following remarks from a highly respected British doctor.According to Dr Hilary Jones, the only safe amount of alcohol that can be consumed during pregnancy is none at all. He insists that the most recent guidelines issued by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists should be followed to the letter and that there is essentially no such thing as ‘safe’ alcohol consumption for mothers carrying children.“There is no safe limit but even small amounts of alcohol can affect the baby,” said the doctor.
“The baby after all, starts off as a few grams in weight, a woman might weigh six, seven, eight stone – that is a lot of weight to what she is drinking,”“But the baby is getting all the alcohol that a woman is consuming, through a placenta and a baby’s developing liver has not got the ability to detoxify the alcohol.”His remarks follow a recently sparked debate as to whether it should be made a criminal offense to consumer alcohol during pregnancy, following the landmark ruling against a mother whose child was born with brain damage as a result of her drinking habits.

New research suggests that alcohol consumed during the first trimester of pregnancy may heighten the risk of prematurity and low birth weight. The study published online in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, noted that middle class women were the most likely to exceed the limit set by the Department of Health. The current recommendation is that pregnant women and those trying to conceive should not drink alcohol at all and no more than 1-2 units a week.The researchers base their findings on responses to food frequency questionnaires by 1,264 women at low risk of birth complications in Leeds. All the women were part of the Caffeine and Reproductive Health (CARE) study, looking into links between diet and birth outcomes.The mums to be were asked how often they drank alcohol, and what type it was, at four time points: in the four weeks before conception; and in each of the subsequent three months (trimesters) throughout the pregnancy.Alcohol consumption was significantly higher before conception and in the first three months of pregnancy than in the subsequent two trimesters, averaging 11, 4, and just under two units a week, respectively.Over half (53%) of the women drank more than the recommended maximum two weekly units during the first trimester. And almost four out of 10 said they drank more than 10 units a week in the period leading up to conception.Those who drank more than two units a week were more likely to be older, educated to degree level, of white ethnicity, and more likely to live in affluent areas.Some 13% of the babies born were underweight, and 4.4% were smaller than would be expected; a similar proportion (4.3%) were born prematurely.Drinking during the first three months of pregnancy was most strongly linked to these outcomes.Women who drank more than the recommended two weekly units were twice as likely to give birth to an unexpectedly small or premature baby than women who abstained completely.But even women who didn’t exceed the maximum recommended alcohol intake during this period were still at increased risk of a premature birth, even after taking account of other influential factors.Drinking during the period leading up to conception was also linked to a higher risk of restricted fetal growth, indicating that this may also be a critical period, suggest the authors.“Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period,” they write.

Their study is the latest in a long debate over whether it is safe to drink at all during pregnancy.The findings, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, suggest the chances of premature birth increased.The NHS recommends people avoid alcohol during pregnancy or when trying to conceive.  But says if people choose to drink, then they should not have more than two units of alcohol (about one pint) twice a week.Heavy drinking in pregnancy is known to be damaging as it can affect the baby's development. But there is far more debate about drinking at the upper limit of the NHS guidelines. Around seven in every 100 births in the UK is premature. The study on 1,264 women in Leeds showed drinking more than the two units limit doubled the risk of premature birth, but even drinking at the limit increased the risk.Camilla Nykjaer, one of the researchers at the University of Leeds, told the BBC: ""This is a very sensitive issue, we don't want women who are pregnant now to panic, the individual risk is actually low.""They shouldn't drink, they should stop drinking if they have been drinking during the pregnancy.""However, a study of more than 11,000 five-year-olds, conducted by University College London, showed drinking one or two units of alcohol a week during pregnancy did not raise the risk of developmental problems in the child.Prof Yvonne Kelly who conducted that research told the BBC:  ""Heavy drinking is really very, very bad, but at low levels, in the work we've done we haven't found any negative effects in childhood. ""It's a massively charged area, getting the tone of this right is quite difficult.""The guidelines are there, women are sentient beings and can choose - it's hugely politically charged all of this, I guess people will make their own judgements.""Dr Patrick O'Brien, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""While the safest approach would be to choose not to drink at all, small amounts of alcohol, not more than one to two units once or twice a week, have not been shown to be harmful after 12 weeks of pregnancy.

565	Middle class women more likely to drink more during pregnancy, increasing the chances of having a premature or unexpectedly small baby, according to researchExpectant mothers who drink during the first three months of pregnancy may increase the chances of having a premature or unexpectedly small baby, according to new research.A study, published online today in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found that drinking the first trimester was strongly linked to babies being born underweight, with those who drank more than the recommended amount up to twice as likely to give birth to a small or premature baby than those women who abstained completely.Government guidelines recommend pregnant women and those trying to conceive should not drink alcohol at all and if they do, it should be no more than one to two units a week.The researchers in the study looked at responses to food frequency questionnaires by 1,264 women at low risk of birth complications.More than half (53%) of the women drank more than the recommended maximum two weekly units during the first trimester.The study found that those who drank more than two units a week were more likely to be older, educated to degree level, of white ethnicity, and more likely to live in affluent areas.But even women who didn’t exceed the maximum recommended alcohol intake during this period were still at increased risk of a premature birth, even after taking account of other factors.The authors said: “Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes.”Andrew Misell, director of Alcohol Concern Cymru, said: “One thing this study shows clearly is that although we focus a lot of attention on teenagers’ drinking, it’s often affluent professionals who drink most. We have to be honest with ourselves about our drinking habits.”Dr Patrick O’Brien, spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, said: “The findings suggest that even small amounts of alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy may increase the risk of a small impairment to the baby’s growth .“This is consistent with RCOG advice that if a woman falls pregnant, she should abstain from alcohol during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy because this is a particularly sensitive time for the baby’s development.“However, while the safest approach would be to choose not to drink at all, small amounts of alcohol, not more than one to two units once or twice a week, have not been shown to be harmful after 12 weeks of pregnancy.”Dr Ron Gray, senior clinical research fellow at the University of Oxford, said further research was needed on whether there is any completely safe amount to drink during pregnancy.

  More than half of women drink more than the recommended limits during the first three months of pregnancy, a study suggests.

  Some 53% of women drank more than the upper limit of two units a week during the first trimester, figures show.

  Middle class women were more likely than women from other classes to drink more than the recommended limits during pregnancy, researchers said.

  They called for a revision of guidance on drinking in pregnancy after their study found even those adhering to the suggested limits were more likely to have problems with their babies than those who did not drink at all.

  The study examined 1200 women in Leeds who filled out food frequency questionnaires, including information on alcohol consumption in the month before conception and the three trimesters of pregnancy.

  On average, women who participated in the study drank 11.2 units a week before conception; four units a week during the first three months; and less than two a week during the last six months of pregnancy.

  If a woman drank more than two units a week in the first three months of pregnancy they were twice as likely to have a baby who was born ""small for gestational age"" when compared to non-drinkers, the researchers found.

  NHS guidance says women should avoid drinking alcohol if they are pregnant or trying to conceive. If they do drink they should have no more than ""one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week"".

  The study's authors said that the results highlight the need for endorsing the ""abstinence-only"" message.

  Professor Andrew Whitelaw, professor of neonatal medicine at the University of Bristol, added: ""This is further evidence that even moderate amounts of alcohol are toxic to the growing foetus and direct toxicity is further worsened by the increased complications of premature birth.""

568	 Women who drink less than the officially recommended intake of alcohol during the first weeks of pregnancy may still be at higher risk of having smaller babies or of giving birth prematurely compared to women who do not drink alcohol at all, a study has found.The Department of Health recommends that women should not drink during pregnancy but accepts that some women do and so has recommended that in such cases they drink no more than one or two units of alcohol – equivalent to a small glass of wine – and no more than once or twice a week.However, the first study to follow a group of British women both before and during pregnancy has found even such small amounts of alcohol each week can have a significant effect on the birth-weight of babies and whether they are born prematurely, which are both linked with poor health later in life.“We found that the first trimester [12 weeks] to be the period most sensitive to the effect of alcohol on the developing foetus,” the researchers said in a study involved nearly 1,300 pregnant women, published in the British Medical Journal.“Women adhering to guidelines in this period were still at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. Our findings suggest that women should be advised to abstain from alcohol when planning to conceive and throughout pregnancy,” the researchers said.The researchers, led by Professor Janet Cade of Leeds University, asked the women to complete a questionnaire of their drinking habits for four time periods: four weeks before conception and for each subsequent three-months or trimesters of the pregnancy.Alcohol consumption was significantly higher before conception and in the first three months of pregnancy than in the subsequent two trimesters. The weekly intake of alcohol averaged 11 units initially, falling to four units and then two units as the pregnancy advanced.Just over half, 53 per cent, of the women said they drank more than the maximum recommended limit of two units per week during the first trimester, and almost 40 per cent said they drank more than 10 units a week in the four weeks leading up to conception when they may not have been aware of becoming pregnant as about 40 per cent of pregnancies are unplanned.Those who drank more than two units a week were more likely to be older, educated to degree level, of white ethnicity and more likely to live in affluent areas of the city, the researchers found.The study also found an association between the 13 per cent of the babies born to this group who were underweight, the 4.4 per cent who were smaller than expected and the 4.3 per cent of babies who were born prematurely.Professor Cade said that women who drank more than the recommended two weekly units were twice as likely to give birth to an unexpectedly small or premature baby than women who abstained completely, but she emphasised that the link did not prove cause and effect.“The advice is, if you are thinking of getting pregnant, keep off the alcohol, and if you find yourself pregnant and have been drinking alcohol, don’t worry as the effect will still be small,” Professor Cade said.We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

          28View  commentsEven the maximum limit advised by doctors is too much for expecting mothers, researchers claim (stock picture) Just three drinks a week in early pregnancy can double the chances of having a premature or unexpectedly small baby - with middle class mothers most at risk, warn researchers.Even two drinks a week - the maximum limit in official guidelines - increases the risk of preterm delivery or an unexpectedly small baby, says a new study.But it shows middle class mothers habitually drink more than this at a time when the growing baby is most likely to come to harm from alcohol.Researchers at Leeds University claim the only safe level of drinking in pregnancy - and when planning to have a baby - is none at all.Researcher Camilla Nykjaer, of the university’s nutritional epidemiology group, said ‘Our findings suggest that women should be advised to abstain from alcohol when planning to conceive and throughout pregnancy.’ The Department of Health recommends that women who are pregnant and trying to conceive should not drink alcohol, and never more than 1-2 units a week.In the latest study led by Professor Janet Cade, 1,264 women at low risk of birth complications in Leeds completed food frequency questionnaires before and during pregnancy.They were asked how often they drank alcohol, and what type it was, at four time points: in the four weeks before conception; and in each of the subsequent three months, or trimesters, throughout the pregnancy.Alcohol consumption was significantly higher before conception and in the first three months of pregnancy than subsequently.On average they had 11 drinks a week before getting pregnant, four during the first three months and just under two units a week later on.Around half of the women drank more than the recommended maximum two weekly units during the first trimester.Almost four out of 10 said they drank more than 10 units a week in the period leading up to conception.Those who drank more than two units a week tended to be older, educated to degree level, of white ethnicity, and more likely to live in affluent areas.Some 13 per cent of babies were born underweight after their mothers had exceeded the alcohol limit Some 13 per cent of the babies born were underweight, 4.4 per cent were smaller than would be expected and 4.3 per cent were born prematurely.Drinking during the first three months of pregnancy was most strongly linked to these outcomes, says a report published online in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.Women who drank more than two weekly units were at double the risk of giving birth to an unexpectedly small or premature baby than women who drank no alcohol at all.But even women who didn’t exceed the maximum recommended alcohol intake at this time were still more likely to have a premature birth.Drinking in the month before conception was also linked to a higher risk of restricted fetal growth, indicating this may also be a critical period, it says.Dr Nykjaer said ‘We found the first trimester to be the period most sensitive to the effect of alcohol on the developing fetus.‘Women adhering to guidelines in this period were still at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes.After the first three months, drinking alcohol has less effect on the growth of the baby ‘Although the Department of Health 
advises avoiding alcohol, the guidelines do give a bit of leeway and our
 research supports abstinence’ she added.The issue of how much is safe to drink during pregnancy has caused controversy in recent years.In
 2007, the Department of Health published guidance saying pregnant women
 should avoid drinking alcohol altogether, as should those trying to 
conceive.Such women should never drink more than one or two units once or twice a week, it says.This replaced previous guidance which said it was safe for pregnant women to drink one to two units of alcohol per week.The Government said its update was not based on new research, but was to provide consistent advice to all women.Drinking in the month before conception was also found to restrict fetal growth The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence also advises women to avoid alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy.Heavy drinking in pregnancy is linked to Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in children, which can cause a range of physical, mental and behavioural problems.Dr Nykjaer stressed that pregnant women should not be scared by the findings.She said ‘We have found an effect in a population of women that helps reinforce guidelines but the effect in an individual woman would be quite small.’ She said women in the study may have under-reported their drinking because of the ‘taboo’ surrounding alcohol and pregnancy.As a result the effect on prematurity and growth may have come from larger intakes of alcohol than the study suggested, she said.Prof Andrew Whitelaw, Professor of Neonatal Medicine, University of Bristol, said ‘This is further evidence that even moderate amounts of alcohol are toxic to the growing fetus and direct toxicity is further worsened by the increased complications of premature birth.‘As 38 per cent of the women admitted risky drinking (over 10 units/week) before pregnancy and pregnancy is sometimes discovered late, the advice has to be to avoid alcohol completely when trying to conceive.’ Dr Ron Gray, Senior Clinical Research Fellow, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, said the study’s design made it difficult to draw any sound conclusions and the results could be due to chance or other factors.He said ‘Further research on whether there is any completely safe amount to drink during pregnancy remains necessary, but in the meantime pregnant women should follow the advice from the UK Chief Medical Officers to avoid alcohol during pregnancy.’

572	"How to Live Better, LongerBehavior, Neuroscience & Your BrainTechnology & the Business of MedicineHealthcare, Policy & GovernanceBreaking News and TrendsScience is Stranger Than FictionThough most abstain from alcohol during pregnancy, many women continue to drink regularly before and after conception — effectively dowsing their babies with booze early in the first trimester.A survey of British women by the United Kingdom’s Health Department found that middle-class women are most likely to flout government health recommendations to either abstain or drink no more than one or two drinks per week.""Our results highlight the need for endorsing the abstinence-only message, and further illuminate how timing of exposure is important in the association of alcohol with birth outcomes, with the first trimester being the most vulnerable period,"" Yvonne Kelly, a professor of epidemiology and public health at University College London, said in a statement.The researchers surveyed more than 1,200 pregnant women in the city of Leeds who were at low risk of birth complications, asking them about their drinking habits during each trimester of pregnancy. Slightly more than half reported downing more than the two-drink maximum recommended by scientists, with four in 10 reporting consumption of 10 or more alcoholic drinks per week in the leadup to conception.Overall, alcohol consumption fell after the first trimester, as women grew into their pregnancies. Women in the study began their first trimesters drinking 11 standard units of alcohol per week, which fell to four drinks and then just under two during the second and third trimesters, respectively.Not surprisingly, older educated white women with higher socioeconomic status drank the most, supporting previous study showing a greater propensity for drink among the more affluent. Of babies born to the women in the study, 13 percent were underweight while 4.4 percent were a bit on the small side. Four-point-three percent were born prematurely. All of those adverse outcomes were strongly linked to alcohol consumption among the pregnant mothers.Conversely, Yvonne and her colleagues found no behavioral or cognitive problems among 5-year-olds born to mothers in the cohort study, but did find a higher incidence among even mothers who’d drank lightly, adhering to the government’s two-drink per week maximum. Early in pregnancy, even small doses of alcohol increase the risk for premature birth and other complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says such birth complications are completely preventable: if a woman abstains from alcohol during pregnancy. Source: Kelly, YJ, Sacker A, Gray R, et al.

The Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is expected to provide millions more Americans with health insurance coverage. But a new report says the ACA alone may not solve disparities in cancer care. The University of Iowa partnered with the American Society of Clinical Oncology recently and released the State of Cancer Care in America: 2014.   November 1 marks a month since the launch of the federal health insurance marketplace under Obamacare.   As has been widely reported, the website has been plagued by problems from the start, and many Americans area struggling to get information.

As we continue our look at the rollout of Obamacare in Iowa, we now turn to the implications of the new law for seniors. One of the key tenets of health reform is making coverage more accessible, by requiring everyone to get insurance – and spreading the risk among the young and old, the healthy and the sick.  Experts say this means some younger, healthier workers will now pay more for their insurance. But for some older Iowans not yet eligible for Medicare, the rates will be within reach for the first time.As we continue our look at the rollout of Obamacare in Iowa, we now turn to the implications of the new law for seniors.

Iowa Public Radio’s Sarah McCammon and Clay Masters have an overview of what to expect on the health exchange.More than twenty states have refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, leaving many Americans below the poverty line with few health insurance options. Some states are coming up with their own low-income health plans which would give them some of the federal money set aside for Medicaid expansions while writing their own rules. Federal authorities approved Iowa’s alternative proposal.

That’s why the law includes funding for workers trained to help people find their way around the new system. But in rural states like Iowa, with populations spread across hundreds of miles, those workers face an especially daunting challenge.

578	"byKevin GroganThe USA faces a serious threat to its cancer care system as growing demand for care outstrips the supply of oncologists.That is the key point of a landmark report released by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) which notes that advances in treatment, screening and prevention have produced a dramatic decline in deaths in recent decades, with a record 13.7 million cancer survivors living in the USA. However, due largely to the aging of the population as well as lifestyle changes, the number of new cancer cases in the USA is projected to increase by as much as 42% by 2025.At the same time, the cost is projected to reach $175 billion by 2020, an increase of 40% from 2010. Despite a near doubling of demand for cancer care services, the number of oncologists will likely grow by only 28%, leaving a projected deficit of 1,487 physicians in just over a decade. ASCO says that given an oncologist sees an average of 300 new patients each year, ""nearly 450,000 new patients are likely to face obstacles in getting life-saving care"". The report reveals that the problem will be especially felt in rural areas where only 3% of oncologists practice  but where nearly one in five Americans lives. More than 70% of US counties analysed by ASCO have no medical oncologists at all.   ASCO president Clifford Hudis said that ""we're facing a collection of challenges, each one of which could keep cancer treatment advances out of reach for some individuals"". He added that ""when patients first hear the word 'cancer,' one of the last things they should have to worry about is finding a qualified doctor"".Dr Hudis went on to say that ""we need to plan and invest to avoid that, pursuing everything from leveraging technology and innovative practice models to using non-physician providers as part of teams providing patient care"". He concludes by saying that ""the US cancer system is among the best in the world, but it simply cannot continue to meet the growing needs of patients with cancer unless fundamental, systemic change is pursued"".

579	"   At a time when we are more and more likely to catch cancers at a stage when they are treatable thanks to improved early detection, the American Society of Clinical Oncology reports the United States is facing a severe shortage of cancer specialists over the coming years, 1200 WOAI news reports.   That means that patients will have to wait longer to see a cancer specialist, at a time when early, aggressive treatment is being seen as the best way to stop cancers from doing damage.   And Dr. Anthony Tolcher, who is the Clinical Director at San Antonio's START Center for Cancer Care, and one of the country's most respected oncologists, says changes in Medicare reimbursements for physicians under Obamacare is making the situation worse.   ""Most patients who develop cancer are actually in the Medicare range, 65 and older, and we also have a new insurance system that is going to pay lower than most commercial insurance rates,"" Dr. Tolcher said.   The result, Dr. Tolcher says, is that new doctors may pick more profitable specialties.   The ASCO report says the United States will be short 1500 oncologists in the coming decade.  The report says that will be especially troublesome for patients in rural areas and in inner cities, which are already underserved.   Dr. Tolcher said all we had to do is look to Canada, which instituted a government run health care system several decades ago.   ""And ultimately, people there are faced with long waits, longer times to see a specialist, and, ultimately, I think, inferior care.""   The report concludes that the drop in oncologists comes at the worst possible time.  The huge Baby boomer generation is moving into their sixties, at a time when they are at the largest risk for cancer.   The ASCO says there are now a record 13.7 million cancer survivors in the United States, and many of them will want to maintain a relationship with their oncologist, something that will be difficult to do with fewer cancer specialists available.   And Obamacare will bring millions of new people into the system who previously did not have insurance, and they will be seeking out cancer treatment as well.   The total cost of cancer treatment is expected to reach $175 billion a year by 2020, up 40% from today's figures.   © 2018 iHeartMedia, Inc.Content Goes Here"	Health

582	U.S. doctors are concerned their abilities to handle an expected surge in cancer cases in the coming years as they face cuts to government health plans which includes reduced payments to physicians, will not be enough. As little as sixteen years, cancer will become the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing heart disease.This report was brought by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in which it reads the number of new cancer cases is expected to increase nearly 45% by 2030. That is a jump from 1.6 million cases to 2.6 cases annually. This expected influx of new patients will place a bigger burden upon a field of medicine already stretched thin by physician shortages and financial difficulties. Because of this bleak, and expected, outlook on cancer cases, the group is calling on the U.S. Congress to help stabilize payments to doctors under the Medicare insurance program for the elderly.Blase Polite, an oncologist at the University of Chicago, had this statement to Reuters, as reported by MSN, on the increase of cancer cases:What you are seeing from Medicare as well as others is they continue to constrain the revenues to practices. At the same time, the number of patients everyone is seeing is going up as the population increases. Combine that with the cost of the care that we’re providing… It’s really creating a very difficult financial situation.In another report by CNN, numerous doctors, especially oncologists, are constantly merging so they can connect with a national network of community doctors which enables them to invest in new technologies and receive group discounts on cancer drugs. In return, the group pays a percentage of their practice’s profit to the network. Unfortunately for them, profit margins are becoming slimmer as competition against hospitals, especially in radiation therapy and other services that would diversify their practice, rises. Insurers would attain advantage in contract negotiations. Because of the imbalance, partially for the favor of hospitals, many community practices are disappearing as their members join large hospitals.Unfortunately for the patient, less community practices means a smaller range for healthcare. They’ll have to travel further, and pay more, if they want their care to be of a higher quality. The president of American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Clifford Hudis simply stated the following:If you can’t get care, you can’t get good care.Right now, Congress is weighing changes to the physician payment system that calls for sharp cuts in reimbursement to doctors. The system has not been put into place because lawmakers override the legislation each year. By the end of March, Congress must either repeal the formula or provide a temporary patch. One proposal would replace the formula with a 0.5% annual increase through 2018, followed by a two-track system with either a 0.5% or a 1% rise depending on what system the provider uses. This measure is estimated to increase federal spending by about $138 billion between 2014 and 2024.Still, a real solution has not been given to oncologist about the dire situation. Ergo, oncologists have taken the problem into their own hands and created CancerLinQ, an electronic health system that will collect and analyze data from millions of patients than provide feedback in terms of standards of care and practices. Its goal is to prevent mistakes before they happen.Even with the progressive steps oncologists are taking, especially with CancerLinQ, they still stress the importance of lifestyle changes as the primary method of prevention. Simple steps, such as quitting tobacco and controlling obesity (which was reported to be linked to ovarian cancer here on The Inquisitr), reduce cancer causes, which also includes recurrence.[Image via Wikipedia Commons]All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.

Reuters: U.S. Cancer Doctors Urge Payment Fix As Cases Set To Rise 
	U.S. cancer doctors are worried about their ability to handle an expected surge in cancer cases in the coming years as they face cuts to government health plans and efforts to reduce payments to physicians. The influential American Society of Clinical Oncology, in a report released on Tuesday, cited estimates that cancer will become the leading killer in the United States by 2030 as the population ages, while treatment costs reach new heights (3/11).
Marketplace: Health Companies Eye Predictive Software For Patient Care
	Pharmacy giant Walgreens recently announced it has begun using predictive software to help guide patient treatment.  It's just one of the latest efforts where health care hopes to standardize day-to-day operations. With estimates that hundreds of billions of dollars is wasted every year on redundant or inefficient services, many industry leaders think healthcare needs to be more like Burger King, where a sandwich in Santa Fe tastes a lot like the sandwich in Seattle. For some the path to slowing health costs may mean medical care has to look more like factory work (Gorenstein, 3/11).

585	 Experience us with dark themeHeart disease is currently the leading cause of death in the United States, and also one of the leading causes of death worldwide. One in every fourth deaths in the U.S. is a result of heart disease, but medical experts believe that will soon change.Sixteen years from now in 2030, the American Society of Clinical Oncology reports that cancer will become the leading cause of death in the United States. Although cancer research has been extensive in recent decades, there are still physician shortages and financial difficulties that the medical field is dealing with.Ongoing research can only do so much, and the prediction of a 45% increase in cancer diagnoses by 2030 is not going to help. There are more than 170 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs, but some people are resistant to them and some people could be further affected negatively by them. However, cancer patients are living as long as they ever have.Obamacare is also expected to have a negative effect on this state of affairs as many more Americans will have health insurance and be eligible for care by 2030. There is already a shortage of oncologists in the United States and that is not expected to improve in the coming years. Additionally, the average cost of cancer drugs is $10,000 per month, which many people already don't have, and many certainly will not have by 2030.Cancer is already creeping up on heart disease. In 2013, the American Cancer Society projected that there would be over 1.6 million new cancer diagnoses and about 580,000 cancer-related deaths. Perhaps the increase in projections for cancer diagnoses could be related to the growing prevalence of obesity, which raises one's risk of cancer.Doctors, health experts, and scientists will be working hard in the coming years to help cope with these imminent problems. School cafeterias have already been placing restrictions on junk food and former mayor Mike Bloomberg of New York City banned large-sized cups to control sugary drink consumption. If society can improve their health in various respects, the United States could help refute these projects by 2030.To read more about this issue, visit the American Cancer Society website as well as this CNN article.TagsCancer, Heart Disease, DeathJoin the Conversation	Health

(WWLP) – A Springfield oncology doctor says there may be a silver lining to the new report predicting cancer will overtake heart disease and become the leading cause of death in the U.S. in 16 years.“Its a result of an aging population,” Baystate Medical Center’s Dr. James Stewart told 22News.  “Cancer is a disease of older people.”According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, new cancer cases are expected to increase 45 percent by 2030, for 1.6 million cases per year to 2.3 million cases annually.While that sounds dire, Dr. Stewart, Chief of Hematology and Oncology at Baystate told 22News that improved lifestyles and medications have reduced high blood pressure and cholesterol and, as a result, are dying less often of heart attacks and strokes.  As people live longer they become more susceptible to developing cancer, a disease of an aging population.“And to some extent it’s good news, because as people are dying less often of heart attacks and strokes, so cancer is becoming a more dominant cause of illness and death.  Simply put, people are living long enough to get cancer,” Stewart said.Dr. Stewart said tobacco use is one of the leading causes of cancer.  His advice to prevent cancer and other illnesses:  don’t smoke, eat right and maintain an ideal  body weight.AdvertisementComments are closed.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement© 1998-2018 WWLP.com | Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. | All rights reserved.Powered by WordPress.com VIPAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement	Health

590	"Gut Microbes Involved in PCOS?Study: Insufficient Oversight on Modifying FDA-Approved DevicesOncoBreak: What Makes a Good Doctor? Guide to Lymphedema; Depression and CancerESRD Death Declines in Vasculitis PatientsSuccessful Reperfusion Also Benefits Brain EdemaThe nation's ability to provide quality cancer care heads toward a conflicted future of increasing demand, rising costs, and a contracting, if not dwindling workforce.The vision of competing interests emerged from a review by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which aired the challenges in a webcast that brought together representatives of some of the key stakeholders.The cancer patient population (and demand for oncology services) is expected to increase by 43% by 2025, whereas the number of practicing oncologists will increase by 28%, a difference that would represent a shortfall of almost 1,500 practitioners.Currently, oncologists see an average of 300 new patients a year. That means 450,000 new cancer patients could face major obstacles in access to quality cancer care, ASCO president Clifford Hudis, MD, said during the webcast.Additional pressure comes from the changing demographics of the U.S. population, not only in terms of patients, but the oncology field. Almost 20% of practicing oncologists are 65 or older, and since 2008, the proportion of oncologists older than 64 has exceeded the proportion younger than 40.The squeeze created by demand that outstrips workforce growth will have the greatest impact on cancer patients in rural areas. About 20% of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, whereas 3% of oncologists practice in areas that would be characterized as rural.""There's a big difference between a 5- or 10-minute car ride across a small town versus a 2-hour drive one way to the big city,"" Hudis, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said during the webcast.The ASCO review showed that 70% of U.S. counties analyzed did not have even one oncologist.The squeeze extends beyond the rural oncology setting and into community practices, he continued. A third of all new cancer patients receive care from community-based oncologists. Yet, almost two-thirds of community oncology practices are likely to merge, sell, or close within the next year.Carolyn Hendricks, MD, an oncologist in solo practice in Bethesda, Md., offers an example of the hard choices that community oncologists have to make. Reimbursement for office-based administration of oncology drugs has decreased, but the cost of purchasing the drugs has increased dramatically with the introduction of novel therapies.Additionally, community oncology practices must maintain the same quality standards (including trained personnel) as those applied to hospital outpatient clinics, which receive higher payments for drug administration.""Over the past 2 years, my practice has lost a significant amount of revenue,"" Hendricks said during the webcast. ""Community oncologists purchase drugs on credit, essentially a giant credit card, and then we scramble to get reimbursed.""As a result, I now have a significant amount of debt, and I have had a significant reduction in my own income. My income now approximates what I made 10 years ago. Of course, I retain my staff's salaries because I love my staff and want to keep them.""Hendricks is now weighing her options, following the breakdown of talks to sell her practice to a hospital, which backed out because of uncertainty about the economics of community-based oncology practice. Merger and closure are the only remaining options, both of which would adversely affect her patients, she added.A final pressure on oncology care comes from the rising cost. The ASCO review suggests that the nation's annual cost for oncology care will reach almost $175 billion by 2020. By comparison, the total cost of oncology care was $104 billion in 2006.Adding to the financial strain has been a National Cancer Institute budget that has lost 23% of its effective purchasing power since 2003, said Hudis.The actions of the federal government figure prominently in the future of oncology care. The congressionally mandated budget cuts that went into effect in 2013, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and the contentious sustainable growth rate offer just a few examples of far-reaching effects of governmental actions related to oncology care.Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee health subcommittee, acknowledged that partisan politics often has interfered with meaningful action to resolve the obstacles to access to quality cancer care. He also acknowledged that cancer care is not necessarily the top priority for many members of the House or Senate.Using a baseball analogy, Blumenauer emphasized the need for small advances before taking a big step toward improving cancer care.""Even if it's not a grand-slam home run, I'm of the philosophy that you can't have a grand-slam home run unless you have someone on base,"" he said. ""So let's hit a single or a double. Let's move forward with something that can make a profound difference in how we deliver healthcare.""""We've made healthcare far too contentious, partisan, ideological, and shouting-head media something,"" he added. ""It doesn't have to be that way, shouldn't be that way. So much of what will make a profound difference in our ability to deliver the quality healthcare we want, at a price that's affordable, in a way that's accessible, actually isn't that hard. It doesn't have to be red state-blue state, Republican-Democrat.""The ASCO report ""The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014"" is available on the organization's website.The material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider.© 2018 MedPage Today, LLC.

595	"How to Live Better, LongerBehavior, Neuroscience & Your BrainTechnology & the Business of MedicineHealthcare, Policy & GovernanceBreaking News and TrendsScience is Stranger Than FictionThe American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released a new report on Tuesday that describes a “perfect storm” of future challenges, which could easily undermine access to the many life-saving advances in cancer care. Among these impending challenges are soaring costs, a physician shortage, a fast growing population of survivors, and threats to smaller practices. “We think we owe it to the 1.6 million Americans who will be diagnosed with cancer this year to address these problems,” said Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, ASCO president, in a live webcast.""The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014"" is a first-ever comprehensive report on the difficulties facing the U.S. cancer care delivery system. Nearly 35,000 oncologists and other professionals are represented by ASCO and their many opinions inform the new report. Months in the making, the report examines both current and projected demand for services and compares this to oncologist workforce supply while also including scrutiny of the full range of economic, regulatory, and administrative pressures that oncology practices face.Key findings include a swift growth in demand for prevention, screening, and treatment services. By 2030, the number of new cancer cases will increase by 45 percent. “At the same time, the number of cancer survivors, now at 13.7 million, will continue to grow,” the report states. Because survivors require ongoing care, the demand for oncology, other cancer treatment services, as well as end-of-life care will naturally increase. “It’s hard for me to think that any other issue that will have a bigger impact on American families than this,” Representative Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) noted in the webcast. He added, “This condition extends onto family and friends and if we don’t do it right, the impact on the caregiver, the impact on the family … can be extraordinarily stressful.”Additionally, the report speaks to uneven access to cancer care across the nation. “Rates of access to care are disproportionately lower for African Americans and Latinos,” is stated in the report. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) may provide millions more with health insurance coverage and though this helps, ASCO believes it will not solve disparities in cancer care due to the fact that it emphasizes expanding Medicaid coverage. (In the past, Medicaid has been associated with poor outcomes for patients with cancer.) Other difficulties with regard to access to care may soon arise due to a doctor shortage.“As of 2012, there were 13,400 oncologists practicing in the U.S.,” said Dr. Carolyn Hendricks, who runs a private oncologist practice in Bethesda, Md. However, Hendricks noted, there are more oncologists who are over 64 and approaching retirement than oncologists under 40 and so the data predicts a shortage of physicians: by ASCO estimates, a deficit of almost 1,500 doctors in the coming years. Add to that a natural and uneven distribution. According to Hendricks, one in five Americans live in areas designated as rural, while only one in 33 oncologists practice in rural areas. This “disconnect” between patients and doctors will matter more in the coming years, especially as smaller oncology practices (under seven oncologists) are becoming more rare. Though they serve more than a third of new patients, nearly two-thirds of small community practices may merge, sell, or close in just the next year alone. With chemo costs based on quantity, Hendricks explained, “We [smaller practices] pay more for the same drugs as bigger practices.”And though costs are increasing throughout the healthcare system, this trend is most pronounced within cancer care, where annual costs are projected to rise to more than $173 billion in 2020 — a whopping 40 percent increase between the years 2010 and 2020. “Access to high-quality cancer care will be sustained and expanded only if we address these rising costs, including the use of unnecessary or ineffective tests and treatments,” noted the report.Despite the glum news, ASCO has developed several initiatives to ease the way into the future. Dr. Blase Polite, University of Chicago Medicine, discussed measures to help waylay costs while addressing distribution of doctors and focused particularly on the expansion of health IT. The Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) and Cancer LINQ help oncologists access standards of care and data no matter where their practice is located. As Polite explained, currently, oncologists “collect information from patients on a daily basis but it sits in our own silos.” The Cancer LINQ, an advance IT system, brings all the data together so when a doctor in a rural practice confronts some rarely seen cancer, he or she will be able to get information from practices across the country.Other recommendations by ASCO include support for SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act 2014, which modifies payment structures, and the establishment of national standards to measure value in oncology care. Consistent, high-quality cancer care will only be achieved if Medicare and private insurers work with physicians to introduce new payment models. “We want to develop the solutions,” Hudis said, referring directly to ASCO's report. “We want to be solving the problem of delivering quality care across the country to the people who need it.” Source: The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014.

598	"(CNN) --  When Dr. Jeffery Ward joined a community oncology practice in Seattle, it had three doctors. A few years later the group merged with another practice, and connected with a national network of community doctors that enabled them to invest in new technologies and receive group discounts on cancer drugs.In return, they paid a percentage of their practice's profit to the network.Over time, the doctors' profit margins became slimmer. They couldn't compete with hospitals in the area for radiation therapy and other services that would have diversified their practice, and insurers had the upper hand in contract negotiations.It became obvious, as Ward said, ""that 0% of zero would be zero."" So Ward and his colleagues decided to leave the community oncology network and join a large hospital system in Seattle.Ward's story illustrates a growing problem for cancer care in the United States, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology's inaugural report, ""The State of Cancer Care in America,"" which was released Tuesday.Nearly two-thirds of the small oncology practices surveyed said they were likely to merge, sell or close in the upcoming year. And as community practices disappear, patients are paying more and traveling farther for quality care, an issue compounded by physician shortages and a rapidly aging population.""If you can't get care, you can't get good care,"" said American Society of Clinical Oncology President Dr. Clifford Hudis, chief of Breast Cancer Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College.In 16 years, cancer is expected to become the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing heart disease, according to the society's report. The number of new cases is expected to increase nearly 45% by 2030, from 1.6 million cases to 2.3 million cases annually.The number of cancer survivors will also increase dramatically. Fifty years ago, only a handful of ""minimally effective"" treatments for cancer existed, according to the report. Today, there are more than 170 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs.Two-thirds of Americans now live at least five years after a cancer diagnosis, up from about half in the 1970s, the report authors write. Survivors need ongoing care, as they're at higher risk for other types of cancer and conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.The Affordable Care Act will also increase the need for oncologists, as millions of Americans get newly covered by health insurance.Taking these future patients into consideration, the oncology society expects demand for oncology services to grow 42% by 2030. Yet the number of oncologists is expected to grow only 28%, leading to a shortage of more than 1,400 physicians.A large part of this is because of the aging physician population, according to the report. In 2008, the proportion of oncologists older than 64 surpassed the proportion younger than 40 for the first time. A large number of communities in central and Midwestern states are covered solely by these older doctors. When they retire, more patients will have to travel farther to find care.""The shortage of oncologists is a real problem,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""Many smaller practices actually provide a lot of uncompensated care to those who do not have insurance or have insurance that does not pay well.""The report also highlights the need to lower costs, for both doctors and patients. Right now, the system is designed to compensate doctors for how much they do, rather than how well they do it. That goes against the oncology society's recommendations, which encourage physicians to avoid performing unnecessary tests and treatments.""One of the reasons that so many patients are harmed in medicine is they are over-treated,"" Brawley said.Drug prices are another big concern. When Ward started practicing, the average cancer drug cost $1,000 per month. Today, he said, the average is $10,000 per month.""If we don't begin to control these prices in one way or another, in 20 more years, the average cost of a cancer drug will be $100,000. That's not sustainable,"" he said. ""Twenty percent copay on $10,000 (per month) is not in the pocketbook for most of my patients.""Brawley said price is one of the biggest reasons there is such a disparity in cancer outcomes; research shows minorities are more likely to develop cancer and more likely to die from cancer.To combat some of the issues raised in the report and improve patient care, the society is working on several projects involving ""big data.""

601	"New research suggests that overweight or obese women are more likely to develop ovarian cancer compared with women of a healthy weight.The study by the American Institute for Cancer Research and World Cancer Research Fund is the first to show that being obese is ""a probable cause of ovarian cancer"".Weight is also known to be an issue in some other variety of cancers, such as colon, uterus, esophagus, kidney, gallbladder, thyroid and pancreas. Approximately 14,000 women die of ovarian cancer every year."	Health
602	"States ChronicleMarch 12, 2014 By Georgia Dawson Leave a Comment In a recent study it was discovered that obesity increases the risks for ovarian cancer. The study involved 22,000 that were diagnosed with ovarian cancer which is one of the deadliest gynecological malignancies. Obesity is known to increase the risks for many illnesses, like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers of the breast, pancreas, colon and esophagus.Ovarian cancer affects 8 in 100,000 American women and obesity may be the cause in 5% of these cases. The American Institute for Cancer Research released a new report on ovarian cancer on Tuesday which says that American women should maintain a healthy weight, meaning that the body mass index should be lower than 30. This way 1, 112 cases of ovarian cancer could be prevented every year.Are tall women more susceptible to ovarian cancer? New study revealsThe study that says obesity increases the risks for ovarian cancer reveals another frightening discovery: tall women have a greater risk of ovarian cancer. The scientists note that tallness itself does not cause the cancer but some of the factors that result in tallness can contribute to the establishment of the tumor. It is known that taller people are more susceptible to a wide range of other cancer forms.Ovarian cancer is a disease which can progress with no recognizable symptoms, thus usually diagnosed when it is more difficult to treat. 14,000 American women die annually because of this disease.The new study reveals that for women who are obese and pre-menopausal the risks of ovarian cancer are higher, in comparison with normal weight pre-menopausal women. The cancer specialists are trying to discover the link between obesity and ovarian cancer saying that high levels of leptin, which is the hunger hormone, and of circulating insulin (both are more common in obese people) increase the growth factors which leads to the appearance of tumors. Filed Under: Health Tagged With: obesity cancer, ovarian cancerWhat Georgia best loves about journalism is the intricacies of covering a story.

A new study report suggests that excess weight might increase ovarian cancer risk.Ovarian cancer develops in the tissues of ovary, according to National Cancer Institute. An estimated 22,240 cases of the cancer were reported in the U.S. last year.""We estimated a 6 percent increase in [ovarian cancer] risk per five [points] increase in body-mass index,"" said report author Dr. Elisa Bandera at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, HealthDay reported.According to Bandera, the average woman's lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is 1.4 percent.Obesity increases risk of several types of cancers including breast (in post menopausal women), kidney, pancreas and rectum cancers. According to American Cancer Society, excess body weight might increase cancer risk via several mechanisms such as hormone regulation, immune system or inflammation.The latest study report was based on 25 population-based studies. Researchers looked at data on diet, weight and levels of physical activity, Healthday reported.  They found that excess weight is linked with an increase in ovarian cancer risk. The risk is especially high for women with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or above. BMI is an indirect way of determining fat levels in the body.

604	A new study has found that obese women are at an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer, one of the most fatal of gynecologic malignancies.While studies have linked excess body weight to higher risks of certain cancers, not much is known about the co-relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the perils of ovarian cancer. The latest report released by the American Institute for Cancer Research and World Cancer Research confirms that excess body fat may be contributory factor for the lethal disease.Lead author of the report Dr. Elisa Bandera, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, in New Brunswick, said: “What this means for cancer prevention is that prevention efforts need to target the life course, not just adulthood, and families, not just individuals. Because we also have evidence linking obesity to other cancers and other chronic diseases, maintenance of healthy weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise is a safe bet to live a healthy life.”25 Studies analyzedTo investigate the issue, experts analyzed 25 studies involving 4 million women that delved into ovarian cancers link to diet, physical activity and weight. Among the study subjects, 16,000 had ovarian cancer. An analysis revealed that for every five additional body index mass units, the threat of the malignancy risk shot up by 6 percent. It was also noted the danger of ovarian cancer was highest for women with a BMI higher than 30 (which classified them as obese) compared to women with a lower BMI.Experts theorize that fat tissues produce hormone like compounds that trigger inflammation and specific proteins which in turn may stimulate the growth of ovarian cells and play a role in the development of the cancer.Implications of the studyThese latest findings not only provide vital information related to women’s risks of developing ovarian cancer but also have relevance for strategies aimed at reducing obesity in the population.Ricardo Uauy, a professor of Public Health Nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was part of the study stated, “This finding is significant for two reasons. Firstly, ovarian cancer is both difficult to detect and often deadly, with the chances of the cancer recurring quite high. Secondly, maintaining a healthy body weight offers women a way to reduce the risk of getting the disease.“This should not be interpreted to mean that excess weight is the single most important risk factor for ovarian cancer. The fact is that if you’re a woman with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer, are taller than most women or smoke, your risk for breast cancer is increased.”	Health
605	"LONDON, March 11 (UPI) --  An international panel of experts found a healthy weight may offer women a relatively modest protection against ovarian cancer, a London researcher says. Ricardo Uauy, a professor of Public Health Nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was the lead member of the international panel of independent experts who worked on the report that found obesity linked to higher ovarian cancer risk. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
The report, published jointly by the World Cancer Research Fund International and the American Institute of Cancer Research, is a comprehensive analysis of all the global scientific research on the link among weight, diet, physical activity and ovarian cancer. It is the first time that ovarian cancer was directly linked to any lifestyle factor, Uauy said. Body fat increases the risk for ovarian and other cancers in complex ways. Fat tissue is not only the main energy store in our bodies, but it is also metabolically active, producing hormone like compounds that promote inflammation and specific proteins that can affect cell growth and turnover, thus increasing the risk of some forms of cancer, Uauy explained. ""This finding is significant for two reasons. Firstly, ovarian cancer is both difficult to detect and often deadly, with the chances of the cancer recurring quite high. Secondly, maintaining a healthy body weight offers women a way to reduce the risk of getting the disease,"" Uauy said on his blog at World Cancer Research Fund International.""This should not be interpreted to mean that excess weight is the single most important risk factor for ovarian cancer. The fact is that if you're a woman with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer, are taller than most women or smoke, your risk for breast cancer is increased.""However maintaining a healthy weight represents an important new addition to preventive strategies against ovarian cancer, he added. The panel analyzed all relevant studies that investigated ovarian cancer's link to diet, physical activity and weight. There were 25 studies related to weight, involving 4 million women.The report concluded every five increments of body mass index increased women's risk of ovarian cancer by 6 percent. For example, for two women both 5 feet, 5 inches, tall with all other factors equal, the woman weighing 200 pounds would be at 6 percent higher risk of developing ovarian cancer than her counterpart at 170 pounds.United Press International is a leading provider of news, photos and information to millions of readers around the globe via UPI.com and its licensing services.

606	Ovarian cancer risk increases with excessive body fat, according to a new study by the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey.The study discovered that a 6 percent increase in the risk of getting ovarian cancer was observed with a 5 point increase in the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a woman.This groundbreaking study was one of the first to consider obesity as a possible cause for the occurrence of ovarian cancer.However, the researchers emphasize that as far as the data shows, there is only a correlation between the two variables. No causal relationship has been established between obesity and ovarian cancer.The researchers also found out that although a BMI of 25 is already considered overweight, women with BMI of 30 and above had the highest risk of developing ovarian cancer.Moreover, overweight women who are also taller than average are seen to have a higher chance of developing ovarian cancer. It is unclear to the researchers how tallness plays a role in the risk of ovarian cancer.According to Health Magazine, the researchers believe that the study sends one single important message: live healthier.Elisa Bandera, associate professor of epidemiology at Rutgers say that efforts to prevent cancer should start as early in life as possible, not just during adulthood. Families, and not just individuals, should take a collaborative effort to prevent cancer risk factors and encourage healthy lifestyle.A healthy weight may be able to prevent some form of cancers, says Bandera.Samantha Heller, a dietitian who was not involved in the study, says she was not surprised by the recent findings.According to her, an excess of fat cells “knocks off the body’s delicate balance of health” which can lead to imbalances in the body that increase the risk of growing cancer cells.Heller, a clinical nutrition coordinator at the Center for Cancer Care in Connecticut, adds that as much as 95 percent of cancers can be prevented by healthy lifestyle and nutritious diet.Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. It is also one of the most difficult cancers to diagnose.A June article by the Inquisitr reported that talcum powder, commonly found in baby powder and makeup, is also linked to ovarian cancer risk.The American Cancer Society estimates that 21,980 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014.They also estimate that about 14,290 women will die from ovarian cancer this year.[Image from Tony Alter via Flickr]All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.

608	" Experience us with dark themeA recent study shows that obesity may be linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer.This report included 25 population-based studies that collected information on weight, diet, physical activity and ovarian cancer risk for participants involved.""We estimated a 6 percent increase in [ovarian cancer] risk per five [points] increase in body-mass index,"" said report author Dr. Elisa Bandera, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, in New Brunswick, via a press release.Researchers found that women with a BMI over 30, which classified them as obese, where at the highest risk of developing ovarian cancer. Those with a BMI over 25 were considered overweight, but at a lesser risk. However, findings also showed that those who were overweight or obese and taller were at the highest risk of being diagnosed with ovarian cancer.""What this means for cancer prevention is that prevention efforts need to target the life course, not just adulthood, and families, not just individuals,"" Bandera said according to WebMD. ""Because we also have evidence linking obesity to other cancers and other chronic diseases, maintenance of healthy weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise is a safe bet to live a healthy life.""The American Cancer Society estimates that ovarian cancer afflicts around 22,400 American women with more than 14,000 of them dying from the illness.

609	"NEW YORK(CBSNewYork) — Researchers have identified and confirmed an important risk factor for ovarian cancer, a disease that strikes 22,000 women, and kills 14,000 women a year in the United States.As CBS 2’s Dr. Max Gomez reported, risk factors for the disease include genetics, age, hormone treatments, and now a risk factor that women can change, obesity.Obesity has been a well-known risk factor for breast cancer, colon, and uterine cancer; it has long been suspected to be a risk factor for ovarian cancer.Ovarian cancer has is a particularly lethal cancer because its symptoms are subtle and similar to other problems.“I had bloating, I had gas, I had bowel problems. I didn’t have much of an appetite,” Marcia Peters said.Dr. Sharyn Lewin, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, explained that the disease is typically detected in its later stages.“We do not have an effective screening mechanism for detecting ovarian cancer at early stages so we usually, unfortunately, detect women when they are stage 3 or 4. Very advanced stages,” Dr. Lewin said.A massive review has confirmed that too much weight can be a risk factor ovarian cancer.The World Cancer Research Fund looked at twenty-five previous studies involving 4-million women and found that for every five additional BMI units women had a 6 percent increase of developing ovarian cancer.Five extra BMI units translates to an average of about 30 lbs of weight.“I think what is new with this study is just the magnitude, the increased risk that we’ve seen,” Dr. Lewin said, “How obesity plays a role in ovarian cancer development and the magnitude of that effect is what is new with this particular article.”The reason that increased weight is risky is that fat tissue actually makes hormones, in this case estrogen, which is known to increase the risk ovarian cancer.The good news is that weight is one of the few risk factors women can actually modify.“Identifying a healthy body weight and ways to modify that with exercise, appropriate diets, that is one risk factor that patients can really do something about,” Dr. Lewin said.The 6 percent increase in risk per 30 lbs is bad enough but when combined with other risk factors it becomes even more significant.Dr. Lewin said that women with a family history of ovarian cancer should be tested for BRCA mutations. The so-called breast cancer gene also increase risk for ovarian cancer.You May Also Be Interested In These Stories

610	"by  WSBT-TV ReportOv-cancer.jpgOvarian cancer is a devastating disease for women, the majority of whom are diagnosed with late stage cancer when the disease spreads past the ovary and throughout the abdominal cavity.Here locally, a team of researchers is learning potentially life saving information.Dr. Sharon Stack is leading the group of researchers at the Harper Cancer Research Institute on the campus of Notre Dame.One of the main areas they're focusing on is to find what causes the cancer cells to leave the primary tumor and to stick onto organs in the peritoneal cavity.""What causes the cells to stop floating and start sticking,"" asked Stack. ""What are the signals that do that? What are the specific molecules that are involved? And we are interested in that from a therapeutic sense, because if we can figure that out, those are potential drug targets that can stop metastatic spread.""Another important part of the research is the role obesity plays with ovarian cancer.Preliminary studies from Dr. Stack's team shows the presence of more fat in the peritoneal cavity is enhancing the metastasism.The number and size of tumors is evident in mice on a western diet with 40% fat as compared to a controlled diet.""That's a potential intervention that patients have a little bit of control over,"" Stack added. ""It's a very difficult intervention, but it's a potential intervention.""This type of research is essential for scientific study and curative results.Dr. Stack hopes to have the findings published before the end of the year."

612	Obesity is probably a factor in some of the almost 22,000 new diagnoses of ovarian cancer that will be handed out this year to American women, a new study says. The finding adds ovarian cancer, the deadliest of the gynecological malignancies, to a growing list of diseases linked to carrying far too much weight.Research has found obesity to contribute to a person's risk for a wide range of illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancers of the breast, colon, pancreas and esophagus.In the case of ovarian cancer, which affects 8 in 100,000 women in the United States, the role of obesity is small: about 5% of U.S. cases of this deadly cancer might be attributable, at least in part, to a woman's obesity, concluded the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund, which released a report on ovarian cancer Tuesday.If American women maintained a healthy weight - with body mass index lower than 30 - the report calculates that 1,112 cases of ovarian cancer might be prevented each year.The report also concludes that a woman's tall stature puts her at higher risk of ovarian cancer. But it notes that tallness itself does not appear to confer that greater risk; rather, some of the factors that result in tallness may also contribute to tumor establishment and growth, the experts suggested. Taller people have been found to be at greater risk for a wide range of other cancers as well.Ovarian cancer typically progresses with no recognizable symptoms, and as a result is often diagnosed in advanced stages, when it is harder to treat. Ovarian cancer claims the lives of about 14,000 women in the United States annually, a number that has scarcely budged in 40 years.It is far more common in post-menopausal women - almost 70% of those diagnosed with ovarian cancer are older than 54. But the new study found that obese pre-menopausal women have a more elevated risk of ovarian cancer (compared with non-obese pre-menopausal women) than do obese post-menopausal women (compared with their non-obese peers).The cancer specialists who drafted the report cited mounting evidence that obesity-induced disturbances both of the metabolism and of sex hormones probably explain the link between obesity and ovarian cancer. High levels of the hunger hormone leptin, and of circulating insulin - both more common in the obese - spur an increase in growth factors that promote tumors. And accumulated fat can be a powerful producer of estrogen, which can fuel some cancer growth.ALSO:Teenage pregnancy, birth, abortion rates all falling, report saysClimate change could worsen ozone levels across the U.S., study saysStudy examines achievement gap between Asian American, white students	Health
613	"Obesity increases a woman's risk for developing ovarian cancer, a recent study suggests.Researchers have investigated the link between these two factors for years, but this study is the first to show that being overweight is a ""probable"" cause.The American Institute for Cancer Research and World Cancer Research Fund released the report, and in it the study's team notes that the greater risk is slight. A 5-point increase in a woman's body-mass index (BMI) -the ratio of a person's height and weight- raises her risk of ovarian cancer 6 percent. As a point of reference, a BMI above 25 is considered overweight, while a BMI over 30 is obese, according to the National Institutes of Health.Obesity is already linked to a variety of tumors, including those of the colon, uterus, esophagus, kidney, gallbladder, thyroid and pancreas, as well as postmenopausal breast cancer, the National Institute of Health continues. And now it seems ovarian cancer can be added to the long list.About 22,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year and it kills more than 14,000 the American Cancer society reports.The American Institute for Cancer Research stresses the importance of maintaining a healthy weight because it could prevent one in five of these cancers, or more than 120,000 a year. But losing weight is not a full proof way of avoiding cancer. There are other factors, sometimes unavoidable, that come into play.However, women may welcome the news, because ""this is something you can do something about. You can't change who your mother was or whether your mother had ovarian cancer,"" Alexi Wright, medical oncologist at the Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancer at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said according to USA Today. ""There is overwhelming evidence that exercise and avoiding obesity improves lots of health conditions.""Some of those conditions also include diabetes and heart disease.But it does give one way women can try to reduce their risk.""While this is no magic bullet, any way to reduce the risk of this deadly cancer, especially something like keeping a healthy weight, which has a role in overall cancer prevention, is worth acting on,"" the American Cancer Society's Alpa Patel said.

Obesity, which has been tied to health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, may increase a woman's ovarian cancer risk, according to a recent study Counsel and Heal reported.Researchers found that excess fat is a ""probable"" increase ovarian cancer risk by 6 percent per five points increase in body-mass index (BMI), report author Elisa Bandera said in the study.Women with a BMI over 30 have the highest risk of developing ovarian cancer.""What this means for cancer prevention is that prevention efforts need to target the life course, not just adulthood, and families, not just individuals,"" Bandera said according to WebMD. ""Because we also have evidence linking obesity to other cancers and other chronic diseases, maintenance of healthy weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise is a safe bet to live a healthy life.""Body fat increases the risk for ovarian cancer and other cancer in complex ways. Fat tissue produces hormone-like compounds that promote inflammation and specific proteins that can affect cell growth and turnover, ""thus increasing the risk of some forms of cancer,"" Ricardo Uauy, a professor of Public Health Nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, explained in the study.Ovarian cancer afflicts around 22,400 American women with more than 14,000 of them dying from the illness, according to the American Cancer Society. The study was released by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund.""This finding is significant for two reasons.

Washington (WUSA9)---Being overweight or obese is a growing cancer risk for both men and women.New reports from the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund finds that body weight increases women's risk of ovarian cancer. After studying 4 million women, results show for every 5-point increase in BMI there is a 6 percent increase risk of developing ovarian cancer. BMI  is a measure of body fat.With two thirds of women in the U.S overweight or obese this is not a statistic to take lightly. Approximately 14,000 women die of ovarian cancer every year, largely due to its difficulty in detection.  Alice Bender, MS, the Associate Director of Nutrition Programs for AICR agrees that weight and lifestyle play an important role reducing your risk of cancer. .""This is really an empowering message. There are no guarantees, but adding activity into your day and healthy plant foods onto your plate are steps you can take today to reduce your risk of cancer and other chronic conditions as well,"" says Bender.14,000 women die each year from ovarian cancer.Bender says, ""There are some steps that women can take to reduce their risk.  Of course there are no guarantees with cancer, but with ovarian cancer there are not many things that we know that are under a woman's control to reduce their risks and now we know that this is one of those.""According to the AICR, this now makes a total of 8 cancers that are tied to obesity.  They include:Post-menopausal breast cancercolorectal cancerendometrial canceresophageal cancerkidney cancergallbladder cancerpancreatic cancerAICR estimates that obesity is responsible for over 120,000 cases of cancer every year in the US.Some recommendations ACIR suggests for preventing cancer are to keep a lean weight, do physical exercise at least 30 minutes a day, and limit sugary drinks.

For the first time a new report suggests that being overweight increases a women’s risk of ovarian cancer, another form of cancer that adds to the expanding list linked to obesity or excess body fat.Researchers have researched the link between excess body fat and ovarian cancer for years now, with inconclusive results. Today’s report, released by the American Institute for Cancer Research and World Cancer Research Fund, is the first to find that being obese is a “probable” cause of ovarian cancer per USA Today.Maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce risk of ovarian cancer per new study.Image courtesy of PixabayResearchers noted that while the increase is modest: a 5-point increase in a women’s body-mass index, or BMI, increases her risk of ovarian cancer by 6^. Body-mass index is calculated by a person’s height and weight. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight, while a BMI over 30 is considered obese, according to the National Institutes of Health.The new report found other weaker evidence to suggest that breastfeeding can help combat the risk of ovarian cancer, though the report calls this evidence “limited” and “suggested” rather than definitive. Wright notes that there is evidence to suggest that taking oral contraceptives reduces ovarian cancer risk, because it reduces the number of times a woman ovulates.Obesity has been linked to a variety of other health illnesses including tumors of the colon, uterus, esophagus, kidney, gallbladder, thyroid, and pancreas, and postmenopausal breast cancer according to the National cancer Institute.Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and weight could prevent about one in five of these cancers, or more than 120,000 a year, according to the American Cancer Research technology.Losing weight also offers more dramatic benefits in terms of reducing other illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, notes Alexi Wright, a medical oncologist at the Susan F. Smith Center for Women’s Cancer at Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute."	Health

The American Institute for Cancer Research and World Cancer Research Fund just released a report in which researchers studied the link between ovarian cancer and excess body fat.  While others have been studying this subject for years the results have thus far been mixed at best.  This new report is the first to find that being overweight is a “probable” cause of ovarian cancer.Specifically, it is reported that an increase of only five points in a woman’s body mass index correlates with a six percent increase in risk of ovarian cancer.  Out of the 4 million female participants in the numerous studies that made up the study, 16,000 came to possess ovarian cancer which in actually one of an ever- lengthening list of different cancers connected to excess body fat or obesity.ObesityOther cancers linked to excess body fat include: pancreatic cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, gallbladder cancer, kidney cancer, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and colorectal cancer.  Ovarian cancer is reportedly the deadliest gynecological cancer in the US.  It kills 14,000 women each year.  However, the American Institute for Cancer Research has found that 120,900 women a year simply by “maintaining a healthy weight.”According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, two-thirds of women in the US are currently overweight if not obese.  Alpa Patel of the American Cancer Society told the press that while the increase in ovarian cancer risk from being obese might seem “modest” to some, the results of this new report remain “significant” in that they give women a way to reduce their risk of contracting cancer.  She concludes: “While this is no magic bullet, any way to reduce the risk of this deadly cancer, especially something like keeping a healthy weight, which has a role in overall cancer prevention, is worth acting on.”(Image courtesy of Sodahead)JN0-360 test   ,

620	"(HealthDay News) — Average-risk, postmenopausal women overestimate their risk of ovarian cancer, but report low cancer worry, according to a study published in the March issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.Laura L. Holman, MD, from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and colleagues surveyed 925 average-risk, postmenopausal women enrolled in the normal-risk ovarian screening study. The authors sought to assess the women's baseline knowledge of ovarian cancer risk and perceptions toward ovarian cancer screening (OCS). Baseline surveys included risk perception, the Cancer Worry Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Short Form-36 Health Survey, as well as surveys relating to risk perception and OCS acceptability.The researchers found that participants estimated the mean lifetime ovarian cancer risk as 29.9%, considerably higher than the actual risk of 1.4% in the United States. More than one-third (35.4%) of participants estimated their lifetime risk to be ≥50%, and only 2.8% estimated their risk correctly. Cancer worry was low, with a median score of 7 out of 24, and anxiety was similar to published norms for this age group (STAI-State and STAI-Trait scores of 30 and 29, respectively, out of 80). Almost all respondents (97.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that the benefits of OCS outweighed the difficulties. Reluctance to undergo OCS was rarely due to time constraints, pain, or embarrassment (1.1, 2.0, and 1.9%, respectively).""The discrepancy between knowledge of and attitudes toward ovarian cancer risk highlights the need for educational efforts in this area,"" the authors write.One author disclosed financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. A second author is a faculty member at Massachusetts General Hospital, which has licensed the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm.Abstract

		Institute on Ovarian Cancer and Obesity
March 11, 2014  Being overweight was directly 
		linked to ovarian cancer, which primarily strikes senior women, in an 
		announcement today by the World Cancer Research Fund International. It 
		is the first time obesity has been directly linked to this deadly 
		cancer, although, many cancer organizations list it as a possible risk 
		factor. This report estimates about five percent of cases in the U.S. 
		are preventable with a healthy body weight.Researchers working on the organizations 
		Continuous Update Project (CUP) discovered the link between body weight 
		and the cancer that caused 14,030 deaths in the U.S. last year  2.4 
		percent of all cancer deaths. There were 22,240 new cases in U.S.; 1.3 
		percent of all new cancer cases, according to the National Cancer 
		Institute.Related

		Interpretation, said: We can now say with certainty that being 
		overweight or obese increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer, 
		just as it does with a number of other cancers such as breast, bowel and 
		womb cancer.This means that women can make lifestyle changes 
		to reduce their chances of getting ovarian cancer. Previously we only 
		knew about risk factors that are fixed, such as age and family history 
		of the disease, but now we can say that keeping to a healthy weight 
		helps reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer.The low survival rate from ovarian cancer is mainly 
		due to late diagnosis  five-year survival rates are more than 90 per 
		cent if diagnosed early but when caught in the late stage of the disease 
		survival rates are lower than ten per cent. Data from the Anglia Cancer Network for women 
		diagnosed 2004-08 shows five-year relative survival rates at 92 per cent 
		for Stage I ovarian cancer and 5.6 per cent at Stage IV. Around 
		two-thirds of cases were diagnosed at Stage III and IV.During the past several decades, the percentage of 
		overweight and obese adults and children has increased markedly in the 
		U.S. The National Cancer Institute says obesity is associated with 
		increased risks of cancers of the esophagus, breast (postmenopausal), 
		endometrium (the lining of the uterus), colon and rectum, kidney, 
		pancreas, thyroid, gallbladder, and possibly other cancer types.


					Estimates of Percent Cancer Prevented by Healthy Weight

					The Continuous Update Project and Second Expert Report 
					identified obesity as a major independent risk factor for 
					cancer. Updated estimates of preventability (PAF%) of 
					cancers of which body fatness is a cause by appropriate body 
					composition, in U.S. and U.K. are shown here.

					The table shows separate estimates on how much cancer could 
					be prevented by being a healthy weight for men and women. 
					The combined estimates for men and women were 21% for US, 
					17% for UK, 14% for Brazil and 11% for China.

					Using numbers of new cases of cancer diagnosed annually from 
					GLOBOCAN 2012 for both men and women combined this 
					translates to about 116,000 cases of cancer in the USA, 
					about 23,000 for the UK, about 20,000 for Brazil and about 
					104,000 for China being preventable if everyone had a 
					healthy weight.

					A separate analysis was conducted for these cancers where 
					there is strong evidence that excess weight increases cancer 
					risk.

		It has so far reported on breast, bowel, pancreatic, womb (endometrial) 
		and ovarian cancer.The ovarian cancer review analyzed 25 studies

		studies showed there is a dose-response of a six per cent increased risk 
		of developing ovarian cancer for every five extra BMI units.More information on the CUP

Obesity and Cancer Risk - National Cancer 
					Institute


					Definition of ovarian cancer: 
					Cancer that forms in tissues of the ovary (one of a pair of 
					female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are 
					formed). Most ovarian cancers are either ovarian epithelial 
					carcinomas (cancer that begins in the cells on the surface 
					of the ovary) or malignant germ cell tumors (cancer that 
					begins in egg cells).  
1.   
					
					What is obesity?
Obesity is a 
					condition in which a person has an abnormally high and 
					unhealthy proportion of body fat.
To measure 
					obesity, researchers commonly use a scale known as the
					
					body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a 
					persons weight (in kilograms) by their height (in meters) 
					squared. BMI provides a more accurate measure of obesity or 
					being overweight than weight alone.
Guidelines 
					established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) place 
					adults age 20 and older into the following categories based 
					on their BMI:

								BMI

								BMI Categories

								Below 18.5

								Underweight
18.5 
								to 24.9

								Normal
25.0 
								to 29.9

								Overweight
30.0 
								and above

								Obese
The National 
					Heart Lung and Blood Institute provides a
					
					BMI calculator.
For children and 
					adolescents (less than 20 years of age), overweight and 
					obesity are based on the Centers for Disease Control and 
					Preventions (CDC)
					
					BMI-for-age growth charts:

								BMI

								BMI Categories

								BMI-for-age at or above sex-specific 85th 
								percentile, but less than 95th 
								percentile

								Overweight

								BMI-for-age at or above sex-specific 95th 
								percentile

								Obese
Compared with 
					people of normal weight, those who are overweight or obese 
					are at greater risk for many diseases, including diabetes, 
					high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and 
					certain cancers.
2.   
					
					How common is overweight or obesity?
Results from the 
					2007-2008
					
					National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
					show that 68 percent of U.S. adults age 20 years and older 
					are overweight or obese. In 1988-1994, by contrast, only 56 
					percent of adults age 20 and older were overweight or obese.
In addition, the 
					percentage of children who are overweight or obese has also 
					increased. Among children and teens ages 2 to 19, 17 percent 
					are estimated to be obese, based on the 20072008 survey. In 
					19881994, that figure was only 10 percent.
3.   
					
					What is known about the relationship between obesity and 
					cancer?
Obesity is 
					associated with increased risks of the following cancer 
					types, and possibly others as well:
One study, using 
					NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, 
					estimated that in 2007 in the United States, about 34,000 
					new cases of cancer in men (4 percent) and 50,500 in women 
					(7 percent) were due to obesity. The percentage of cases 
					attributed to obesity varied widely for different cancer 
					types but was as high as 40 percent for some cancers, 
					particularly endometrial cancer and esophageal 
					adenocarcinoma.
A projection of 
					the future health and economic burden of obesity in 2030 
					estimated that continuation of existing trends in obesity 
					will lead to about 500,000 additional cases of cancer in the 
					United States by 2030. This analysis also found that if 
					every adult reduced their BMI by 1 percent, which would be 
					equivalent to a weight loss of roughly 1 kg (or 2.2 lbs) for 
					an adult of average weight, this would prevent the increase 
					in the number of cancer cases and actually result in the 
					avoidance of about 100,000 new cases of cancer.
Several possible 
					mechanisms have been suggested to explain the association of 
					obesity with increased risk of certain cancers:
Other possible 
					mechanisms include altered immune responses, effects on the 
					nuclear factor kappa beta system, and
					
					oxidative stress.

Body weight is not a factor that has been widely associated with the the risk of developing ovarian cancer. But new research suggests that women who are overweight or obese are more likely to develop the disease, compared with women of a healthy weight.

Investigators from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research conducted the study as part of the WCRF's Continuous Update Project.

The project monitors and assesses research associated with cancer prevention and uses this information to come to conclusions about how lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, may reduce cancer risk.

For other cancers, including breast, bowel and womb cancer, past research has found that being overweight or obese is a risk factor. Now, ovarian cancer can be added to the list, meaning women can make lifestyle changes to reduce their chances of developing the disease.

To reach their findings, the research team reviewed 25 studies involving 4 million women. Of these, 16,000 had ovarian cancer.

The researchers found that for every 5 additional body mass index (BMI) units, there was a 6% increase in the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Furthermore, a non-linear analysis revealed that women with a BMI greater than 28.4 kg/m2 had a significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer than women with a lower BMI.

Commenting on the findings, Dr. Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at WCRF, says:
""Previously we only knew about risk factors that are fixed, such as age and family history of the disease, but now we can say that keeping to a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer.""
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a BMI of 18.5-24.9 is deemed a normal weight for adults aged 20 years or older, while 25-29.9 is classed as overweight and 30 or above is deemed as obese.

Approximately 64% of women in the US are considered to be overweight or obese. These women are at increased risk of 1 in 8 cancers, including breast, bowel, womb, colorectal and now, ovarian cancer.

""These latest findings from the Continuous Update Project show how important body weight is for an increasing number of cancers affecting both men and women,"" says Dr. Kate Allen, executive director of science and public affairs at WCRF.

In order to maintain a healthy weight, the WCRF says it is important to have BMI checked regularly.

Choosing foods that are lower in energy density, avoiding fast food and sugary drinks, and  opting for smaller portion sizes for meals will also help maintain a healthy weight.

Being physically active is also important for a healthy weight, and both diet and exercise has been directly linked to reduced cancer risk.

Medical News Today recently reported on a study finding that postmenopausal women who followed a healthy lifestyle had a 22% lower risk of breast cancer and a 52% lower risk of colorectal cancer.

MediLexicon, Intl., 11 Mar. 2014. Web.25 Jan. 2018. <https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/273804.php>APAWhiteman, H. (2014, March 11). ""Risk for ovarian cancer increased by being overweight or obese."" Medical News Today. Retrieved fromhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/273804.php.Please note: If no author information is provided, the source is cited instead.Scientists don't know exactly what causes ovarian cancer. Women with ovarian cancer may have no symptoms; ovarian cancer is hard to detect early. For thousands of years obesity was rarely seen. In 1997 the WHO formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic. Thus, millions of women are at increased risk of breast, bowel, womb, colorectal and ovarian cancer. Overweight and obesity are associated with the features of asymptomatic and multicausal iron-deficiency anemia, including low hemoglobin concentration, low serum iron and transferrin saturation (TS), and elevated serum ferritin. Does obesity increase risk for iron deficiency? Although these two conditions represent opposite ends of the spectrum of over-nutrition and under-nutrition, they appear to be linked. Paradoxically, overweight individuals are at higher risk of iron deficiency than normal-weight individuals. Several hypotheses have been suggested for this paradox. The most plausible explanation for the link between iron deficiency and obesity and ovarian cancer: women who are obese have abnormal distribution of iron in the body. They have iron-deficiency anemia and, at the same time, their organs (ovaries, breasts, etc.) may be affected by deleterious iron deposits. Iron is distributed in six compartments in the body: hemoglobin (male - 2300 mg; female - 1750 mg); ferritin and hemosiderin; myoglobin; transferrin; labile iron pool (LIP); other heme proteins and flavorproteins. Irrespective of actual iron intake, obese individuals have a low iron status (but elevated serum ferritin). Paradoxically, there is an epidemic of obesity and there is an epidemic of cancer today.Your privacy is important to us.

623	"Women tending towards the higher end of the Body Mass Index (BMI) bear an increased risk of developing ovarian tumors, a recent study has found.Obesity has previously been tied to a higher incidence of other cancers, including breast, kidney, gallbladder and pancreatic (among others), though a new report from the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) has unearthed a previously undetermined link between surplus weight and ovarian cancer. Indeed, the study tracked a marked increase per every five-point leap in BMI, with each interval upping the risk by six percent.A definite causal relationship between obesity and ovarian cancer remains unconfirmed, despite numbers gleaned from the 25 population-based studies indicating a clear increase in the likelihood of developing tumors. ""We can now say with certainty that being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer, just as it does with a number of other cancers such as breast, bowel and womb cancer,"" said Dr. Rachel Thompson, the WCRF's head of research and interpretation.The same report found that approximately 600,000 Americans develop cancers caused by excess weight annually, and has estimated that around 120,000 of those cases could be avoided if everybody was at their optimal weight. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a healthy weight sitting between 18.5 and 24.9 on the BMI, while anything between 25 and 30 is deemed overweight. Obesity is determined if the BMI falls at 30 or over.The findings are instrumental in the prevention of ovarian tumors, with previous causes relegated to immutable factors such as family history of the disease (including presence of the faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes) and even age. Now, with lifestyle noted as a likely culprit, at-risk women can take steps to improve their diet and exercise in a bid to ward off the disease. ""This means that women can make lifestyle changes to reduce their chances of getting ovarian cancer. Previously, we only knew about risk factors that are fixed, such as age and family history of the disease, but now we can say that keeping to a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer,"" said Thompson. Sign up for our email newsletter today.Tech Times' biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.By clicking on 'Submit' button above, you confirm that you accept Tech Times Terms & ConditionsMedicineAncientEarth/EnvironmentVideo GamesVideo Games

624	"New research suggests women who are heavier run a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.Ovarian cancer, the most deadly-known gynecological cancer, has now been added to the growing number of cancers known to be associated with body weight, an American Institute for Cancer Research news release reported.Other cancers related to a higher body weight include: ""post-menopausal breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, gallbladder cancer and pancreatic cancer,"" the news release reported. About 585,600 cases of these cancers are diagnosed every year.New research suggests that if everyone was at a healthy weight it would prevent 120,900, or one in five of these cancer cases, the news release reported.""This is an important finding because it shows a way for women to reduce their chances of getting ovarian cancer,"" Elisa V. Bandera, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Epidemiology at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, and one of the expert panelists who authored the new AICR/WCRF Continuous Update Project (CUP) report, said in the news release. ""There is so much we don't know about preventing ovarian cancer, but now we can tell women that keeping to a healthy weight can help protect against this deadly disease.""To make their findings the researchers looked at four million women; 16,000 of them were diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The team identified a six percent increase in ovarian cancer risk for every five point increase in BMI.""These latest findings from the Continuous Update Project offer another reminder that our weight, and our lifestyle, play an important role in cancer risk for both women and men,"" AICR Associate Director of Nutrition Programs, Alice Bender, MS, RDN, said in the news releae. ""This is really an empowering message. There are no guarantees, but adding activity into your day and healthy plant foods onto your plate are steps you can take today to reduce your risk of cancer and other chronic conditions as well."""

625	"""Greater body fatness is a probable cause of ovarian cancer in women,"" according to a new report by the American Institute for Cancer Research.For its report, the AICR looked at 25 studies that involved data on 4 million women, 16,000 of whom had ovarian cancer, and found a link between body fat and ovarian cancer—a link that the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute has long suspected.There are many reasons why fat may raise cancer risk. Fat cells secrete estrogen, a hormone that can help fuel cancer, and people who are overweight or obese have overall higher levels of inflammation, which can affect heart disease and cancer risk alike. Fat cells produce other hormones, such as leptin and growth factors, that may affect the out-of-control cell growth that underlies cancer.Out of all the possible causes of ovarian cancer that the AICR investigated—milk, eggs, coffee, meat, to name a few—body fat was the only one to provide evidence showing a possible cause.""There is so much we don't know about preventing ovarian cancer,"" said Dr. Elisa Bandera of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, who helped write the study, ""But now we can tell women that keeping to a healthy weight can help protect against this deadly disease."""

627	"Obesity is known to increase the risk for certain cancers, such as breast and bowel. Now, a study concludes that it may also raise the chances of developing ovarian cancer.Researchers from the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research reviewed 25 studies of four million women. Sixteen thousand had ovarian cancer. A correlation between obesity and ovarian cancer was noted when it became clear that for every five additional body index mass (BMI) units, the risk of ovarian cancer rose by 6 percent. Additionally, a non-linear analysis found that women with a BMI higher than 28.4 significantly increased their risk of ovarian cancer compared to women with a lower BMI.This is considered a major finding to help in the fight to prevent ovarian cancer. As one researcher noted, only fixed risk factors such as age and family history were previously known, but now working to maintain a healthy weight may be a factor in preventing the development of ovarian cancer.NEXT: Research supports “five-second rule” on dropped foodSourced from: medicalnewstoday.com, Being overweight or obese ‘a risk factor’ for ovarian cancerIf there was a Patient Zero of the Flu Pandemic of 1918 that killed as many as 50 million people worldwide, it most likely was Albert Gitchell. He was a cook at the Army base in Fort Riley, Kansas and early on this Monday morning, he struggles to the infirmary with a bad headache, a very sore throat and a high fever. He thinks it’s a bad cold, but soon other soldiers are streaming into the hospital, complaining of similar symptoms.By noon, 100 of them are lying in the infirmary’s beds. Over the next few weeks, more than 1,000 men at Fort Riley will be diagnosed with the mysterious disease and 46 of them will die.Sadly, the outbreak was only getting started.  Many soldiers at the base shipped out for Europe that spring to fight in World War I and soon the very contagious strain of flu was spreading through the continent and beyond. That June, more than 31,000 cases were reported in Great Britain alone. But it became known as Spanish influenza because Spain, as a neutral country in the war, didn’t censor news so the public was able to read much more about the devastating impact there.Just when it seemed the epidemic was ending, it returned with a vengeance that fall. And it was  a more deadly version, one that atypically struck down young and otherwise healthy adults instead of infants and old people… Within hours of feeling the first symptoms of extreme fatigue, fever, and headache, victims started turning blue. Blood flowed from their noses and mouths and sometimes their ears. Many suffocated from the fluid in their lungs only a day or two after realizing they were sick.Epidemics erupted in three port cities: Freetown, Sierra Leone; Brest, France, and Boston, Massachusetts. In Boston, dockworkers reported sick in massive numbers. Suffering from fevers as high as 105 degrees, the workers had severe muscle and joint pains.As it spread again throughout the U.S., many communities ran short of hospital beds, and community centers and schools were converted into emergency centers, many of them staffed by medical and nursing students because of a shortage of doctors.Some cities ordered everyone to wear masks, and schools, churches, restaurants and theaters were closed. A few towns even made it illegal to cough or spit in public. Telegraph and Hgarbage men reported sick. The mail piled up as postal carriers failed to come to work.At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat this killer flu strain or prevent its spread, and by the time the pandemic ended in the summer of 1919, more than one out of four Americans had contracted the disease. An estimated 675,000 of them died.  .Almost 90 years later, in 2008, researchers announced they’d discovered what made the 1918 flu so deadly: A group of three genes enabled the virus to weaken a victim’s bronchial tubes and lungs and clear the way for bacterial pneumonia to develop.More slices of historyFirst frozen food sold: March 6, 1930 DNA discovered: Feb. 28, 1953Alka Seltzer unveiled: Feb. 21, 1931First penicillin shot: Feb. 12, 1941Longest surgery: Feb. 4-8, 1951While still in the early stages, a group at the University of Houston in Texas is developing a diagnostic system to help detect diseases through a smartphone and a $20 lens attachment to read results. The journal ACS Photonics recently published a paper outlining the details of how the system works.The diagnostic system is essentially a biosensing device and a microscope for reading the results. The smartphone, along with the lens, would act as the microscope. The biosensing device is outfitted with nanotechnology that combines optical transmission of nanoholes with silver staining. The device would detect the result of a chemical reaction between a pathogen and a bonding molecule.What types of diseases could it detect? Well, a common pathogen such as strep bacterium when it reacts with an anti-strep antibody. When the reaction occurs, the system senses it in a way that can’t be confused with any other reactions.The team created a glass slide with a thin film of gold that contains thousands of nanoholes in ordered rows and columns for the biosensing part of the device. They then worked on putting the pathogens in the nanoholes so the chemical reactions can take place within the holes. However, when the team combined the pathogens with the antibodies, the reactions were not great enough to plug the hole completely, which led to inaccurate results.To fix the problem, the team then used antibodies with enzymes that created silver particles when reacting to certain chemicals. This allowed for the nanoholes to completely fill. So a person would put a pathogen sample on the slide in a special antibody solution then shine a light through the holes. If the holes are blocked, then it is a positive diagnosis.The team is still working on the microscope aspect, getting accurate results every time, and in making the device affordable. The hope is that this device could be useful in diagnosing people after chemical disasters and in helping to diagnose more common ailments in undeveloped countries.NEXT: (Infographic) The happiness effectSourced from: medicalnewstoday.com, Smartphones to diagnose diseases in real time

Putting on weight can increase women's risk of ovarian cancer, according to a new assessment of the evidence.Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis because it has few symptoms and is usually caught at a late stage. More than 7,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year and there are about 4,300 deaths. If it is caught early more than 90% of women will survive for at least five years, but at the late stage that drops to less than 10%.The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), which works on the prevention of cancer, has published an update of the risks for ovarian cancer, as part of its Continuous Update Project. For the first time, it says that overweight and obesity are a probable cause.Weight is known to be an issue in some other cancers, including breast and bowel cancer. In the UK 61% of people (57% of women) are overweight or obese which, says the WCRF, puts them at greater risk of developing one of eight types of cancer than their normal-weight neighbours.The WRCF says an estimated 23,400 cases of cancer – one in six – could be avoided if nobody was overweight. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of its 10 recommendations for avoiding cancer.""We can now say with certainty that being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer, just as it does with a number of other cancers such as breast, bowel and womb cancer,"" said Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation. ""This means that women can make lifestyle changes to reduce their chances of getting ovarian cancer.""Previously we only knew about risk factors that are fixed, such as age and family history of the disease, but now we can say that keeping to a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer.""The increased risk is fairly small. The researchers analysed the results of 25 studies involving 4 million women, 16,000 of whom developed ovarian cancer. They found a 6% increased risk for every five extra BMI units (BMI – body mass index – is a calculation based on weight relative to height, and normal BMI levels are 18.5 to 25).How significant a 6% increase for every extra BMI point is will depend on a woman's risk to begin with; it matters far more to someone who has a family history of it, for instance. But being overweight is one of the few ovarian cancer risk factors that women can do something about.Adult height is also a risk, the WCRF says, because it is a result of the rate of growth in the womb and in childhood, which is also a factor in obesity.The charity Target Ovarian Cancer pointed out that the additional risk was not massive, but it highlighted the benefits of healthier lifestyles.""This new study supports earlier work that a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of ovarian cancer,"" said Dr Simon Newman, head of research. ""For someone without a family history of ovarian cancer, their lifetime risk of developing the disease is 2%. The findings of this latest study suggest this increases to 2.24% for an obese person, which is still a low risk.""Gilda Witte, chief executive of the charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said the research finally provided clarity on the link between obesity and ovarian cancer.""This robust report enables us to give clear guidance to women, and importantly for parents who can begin to encourage their daughters to adopt a healthy lifestyle as soon as possible so that the next generation has the best chance of reducing their risk,"" she said."

  A council is urging people across Hertsmere to prepare for battle against cigarettes today on national No Smoking Day.

  This year’s campaign has a ‘V for Victory’ theme and is aimed at helping smokers put together a personal battle plan to quit the habit.

  Councillor Brenda Batten, who is responsible for health at Hertsmere Borough Council, said: “No Smoking Day is a great opportunity for smokers in Hertsmere to quit alongside hundreds of thousands of other people across the UK.
  “We know that quitting isn’t easy but there is support available and you can win the battle against cigarettes.

  ""With help, smokers have a higher chance of succeeding and this is why we are spreading the word about the range of services and resources available to them.

  ""Let’s hope No Smoking Day is your start on the road to victory and towards a healthier and wealthier smoke-free life.”

  The annual campaign is run by the British Heart Foundation and encouraged one million smokers to make a quit attempt last year.

631	Shocking pictures related to the effects of tobacco smoking have no influence on heavy smokers. It has been shown in a study of the University Institute of Mental Health of Montreal. Researchers compared, using neuroimaging techniques, the emotional reactions of 30 smokers when they see different type of images. Specifically tobacco-related negative images (ex. lung cancer) compared to other negative images (ex. old man on his deathbed), as well as appetitive images of the cigarette. The smokers' brain is attracted by images that confirm their choice to smoke compared to those that encourage quitting, meaning that they do not pay attention to the negative ones. In fact, the study reveals that brain regions associated with motivation, in smokers, are most activated when there are images of pleasure associated with smoking.Shocking pictures related to the effects of tobacco smoking have no influence on heavy smokers.

  A QUARTER of smokers in Swindon and Wiltshire fear they will not live long enough to support those closest to them in times of need, new research has revealed ahead of tomorrow’s national No Smoking Day.

  In a survey of more than 1,000 people across the South West, around 27 per cent of smokers in Swindon and Wiltshire expressed fears they would not be present for their family and friends as a result of the lethal habit.

  The same number were worried they would miss out on major celebrations and family milestones such as the births of children and grandchildren.

  The research carried out by Smokefree South West also showed high levels of anxiety among relatives with 46 per cent admitting they were concerned about the regret their loved one would feel at the prospect of having their life cut short as a result of smoking.

  An estimated 98,810 adults smoke in Swindon and Wiltshire with around 910 predicted to die of smoking-related diseases.

  To curb this alarming trend and encourage residents to give up tobacco on No Smoking Day, former chain smokers such as Nick Sheppard, of Walcot, want to show that quitting is achievable and also the only healthy choice.

  The 47-year-old gave up tobacco after more than three decades in 2012 and has since become a stop smoking adviser. “I quit smoking after 35 years,” he said.

  “My main reason was worries about health. I had a motorbike accident in 1998 which causes lung problems, and along with asthma I was finding it hard to breathe. I was functioning on 1¼ lungs.

  “I am a volunteer for the drug treatment agency and my work involves trying to get people to break the cycle of addiction so it felt hypocritical if I was rushing off for a cigarette every five minutes. I felt inspired that I should make the change to escape my own addiction to nicotine.”

  Once he had made the decision to quit, Nick contacted his local Stop Smoking Service at Park Lane Surgery in Swindon.

  “Steph at the surgery was absolutely fantastic, she gave me the right tools to quit and I always knew that she would be available if I needed support.

  “ I now work for SEQOL as a stop smoking adviser so I have first-hand experience of what it’s like to give up which helps.

  “Life is a lot better now. I feel that my life is much cleaner and healthier and I don’t have to use inhalers at the moment.

  “I am much more active and can enjoy getting out and about.”

  Nick joined the estimated 32,000 people in the South West who gave up smoking last year using the free NHS Stop Smoking Service.

                The Advertising Standards Authority has moved to ban an advert for Ten Motives e-cigarettes following a ruling that its claim to be a ‘healthier smoking alternative’ was unsubstantiated.A leaflet produced by the brand backed up its purported health benefits by saying it lacked any tar or the 4,000 cancerous toxins and carcinogens found in standard cigarettes. Ten Motives further cited a briefing notice from public health charity Ash that read: “people smoke for nicotine but they die from tar.”The ASA dismissed these arguments however, stating that such claims were misleading as they did not substantiate the specific effect of this particular brand of e-cigarette.As a result the ad has been banned and cannot be reproduced in its current form.This article is about: UK, Ten Motives, AdvertisingSource: guardianJohn Glenday is responsible for compiling The Drum's daily morning bulletin and ensuring that overnight breaking news is covered while you're still brushing your teeth.

635	PublishedonByThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the claims in the adverts cannot be fully substantiated, adding that Ten Motives does not have sufficient evidence.The adjudication follows a complaint made to the ASA about health claims made by the e-cigarette manufacturer on an advertising leaflet. It said its product was the “healthier smoking alternative” and that “you can still enjoy smoking without worrying about the effects on your health”.Although the ASA conceded that studies over the past three decades have indicated the absence of tar and other harmful chemicals in nicotine products are much better than conventional cigarettes, it said that the two terms used in the campaign were “misleading”.Between 10 and 15% of smokers in the UK are currently consuming e-cigarette products, but despite the health benefits of using them instead of tobacco-based products, regulators are beginning to clamp down on advertisements and place restrictions on sales.In directives announced last month, the European Union (EU) proposed changes to the sale and manufacture of e-cigarettes in an attempt to step up safety and quality requirements.This week, a subsidiary of one of the world’s largest tobacco firms, Imperial Tobacco, launched a legal battle in the US over patents on its e-cigarettes, saying that its competitors had breached copyright laws.Fontem Ventures, which produces e-cigarettes and recently struck a deal to sell its product in Boots, filed the lawsuit in California. It claimed that it was “protecting [its] intellectual property” and seeking “fair compensation for the infringements of [its] patents”.The tobacco industry is estimated to be worth around $700 billion (£421 billion) globally, with the European e-cigarette industry worth around €2 billion (£1.7 billion).EU tobacco regulations proposals ‘a victory for public health’British American Tobacco buys electronic cigarette firmCouncils are still investing in tobacco while fighting smoking addictionCouncil tobacco investments: incongruous and unethical Local councils defend tobacco investments Campaigners Appeal With EU To Make Food Waste Promise BindingGreener UK Respond To PM Brexit SpeechPorpoises And Dolphins Have Been Washing Ashore In CornwallBees: EU Food Watchdog Delays Neonic Pesticide Safety ReviewUK Ethical Sector Grows To Almost Double The Tobacco Industry‘Scotland’s Place in Europe’ Proposals Welcomed By FoE And Wildlife TrustPublishedonByMost of our focus on technological development to lessen our environmental impact has been focused on cleaner, more efficient methods of generating electricity. The cost of solar energy production, for example, is slated to fall more than 75 percent between 2010 and 2020.This is a massive step forward, and it’s good that engineers and researchers are working for even more advancements in this area. But what about technologies that reduce the amount of energy we demand in the first place?Though it doesn’t get as much attention in the press, we’re making tremendous progress in this area, too.These are some of the top emerging technologies that have the power to reduce our energy demands:All technologies need time, money, and consumer acceptance to be developed. Fortunately, a growing number of consumers are becoming enthusiastic about finding new ways to reduce their energy consumption and overall environmental impact. As long as we keep making the investment, our tools to create cleaner energy and demand less energy in the first place should have a massive positive effect on our environment—and even our daily lives.PublishedonByOur obsession with all things new has blighted the planet. We have a waste crisis, particularly when it comes to plastic. US scientists have calculated the total amount of plastic ever made – 8.3 billion tons! Unfortunately, only 9% of this is estimated to have been recycled. And current global trends point to there being 12 billion tons of plastic waste by 2050. However, two ancient Japanese philosophies are providing an antidote to the excesses of modern life. By emphasizing the elimination of waste and the acceptance of the old and imperfect, the concepts of Mottainai and Wabi-Sabi have positively influenced Japanese life for centuries.They are now making their way into the consciousness of the Western mainstream, with an increasing influence in the UK and US. By encouraging us to be frugal with our possessions, (i.e. using natural materials for interior design) these concepts can be the future of eco-living. Wabi-Sabi emphasizes an acceptance of transience and imperfection. Although Wabi had the original meaning of sad and lonely, it has come to describe those that are simple, unmaterialistic and at one with nature. The term Sabi is defined as the “the bloom of time”, and has evolved into a new meaning: taking pleasure and seeing beauty in things that are old and faded.  Any flaws in objects, like cracks or marks, are cherished because they illustrate the passage of time. Wear and tear is seen as a representation of their loving use. This makes it intrinsically linked to Wabi, due to its emphasis on simplicity and rejection of materialism.In the West, Wabi-Sabi has infiltrated many elements of daily life, from cuisine to interior design. Specialist Japanese homeware companies, like Sansho, source handmade products that embody the Wabi-Sabi philosophy. Their products, largely made from natural materials, are handcrafted by traditional Japanese artisans – meaning no two pieces are the same and no two pieces are “perfect” in size or shape.MottainaiMottainai is a term expressing a feeling of regret concerning waste, translating roughly in English to either “what a waste!” or “Don’t waste!”. The philosophy emphasizes the intrinsic value of a resource or object, and is linked to hinto animism, the notion that all objects have a spirit, or ‘kami’. The idea that we are part of nature is a key part of Japanese psychology.Mottainai also has origins in Buddhist philosophy. The Buddhist monastic tradition emphasizes a life of frugality, to allow us to concentrate on attaining enlightenment. It is from this move towards frugality that a link to Mottainai as a concept of waste can be made. Wabi-Sabi is still a prominent feature of Japanese life today, and has remained instrumental in the way people design their homes. The ideas of imperfection and frugality are hugely influential.For example, instead of buying a brand-new kitchen table, many Japanese people instead retain a table that has been passed through the generations. Although its long use can be seen by various marks and scratches, Wabi-Sabi has taught people that they should value it because of its imperfect nature. Those scratches and marks are a story and signify the passage of time. This is a far cry from what we typically associate with the Western World.Like Wabi Sabi, Mottainai is manifested throughout Japanese life, creating a great respect for Japanese resources. This has had a major impact on home design. For example, the Japanese prefer natural materials in their homes, such as using soil and dried grass as thermal insulation.The UK appears to be increasingly influenced by thes two concepts. Some new reports indicate that Wabi Sabi has been labelled as ‘the trend of 2018’. For example, Japanese ofuro baths inspired the project that won the New London Architecture’s 2017 Don’t Move, Improve award. Ofuro baths are smaller than typical baths, use less water, and are usually made out of natural materials, like hinoki wood. Many other UK properties have also been influenced by these philosophies, such as natural Kebony wood being applied to the external cladding of a Victorian property in Hampstead; or a house in Lancaster Gate using rice paper partitions as sub-dividers. These examples embody the spirit of both philosophies. They are representative of Mottainai because of their use of natural resources to discourage waste. And they’re reflective of Wabi-Sabi because they accept imperfect materials that have not been engineered or modified. In a world that is plagued by mass over-consumption and an incessant need for novelty, the ancient concepts of Mottainai and Wabi-Sabi provide a blueprint for living a more sustainable life. They help us to reduce consumption and put less of a strain on the planet. This refreshing mindset can help us transform the way we go about our day to day lives.How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Use, Really?How to Limit Your Environmental Impact After a Home RemodelWant to See Green Done Right?

637	Support the newsElectronic cigarettes, which deliver nicotine in the form of a vapor through battery-powered devices that often resemble traditional tobacco cigarettes, are currently on the lips not only of consumers, but government officials as well.The dominoes are starting to fall: States are limiting both the sale of e-cigarettes and their use, placing restrictions on them that mirror the stringent regulations that have become commonplace in a zero-tobacco-tolerance world.By all appearances, government officials are simply trying to protect the public health, as many people believe they should. But there’s another way of looking at the rush to regulation: E-cigarettes are not rendering unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s.That is to say, taxes.Think about it: States are receiving megabucks every year from tobacco companies thanks to the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement that requires the tobacco industry to pay 46 states approximately $10 billion annually for the indefinite future.There’s plenty of debate over whether electronic cigarettes make people more likely to quit smoking real cigarettes or less likely to quit, but almost no one will debate this: Government officials will likely soon be addicted to e-cig tax revenues.Then there are the extortionate federal and state excise taxes on every pack of cigarettes sold in the U.S. (Fun fact to know and tell: In 2007, states hiked excise taxes on cigarettes by $1 billion. The 2007 increase in state alcohol taxes? $3 million.)You see where this is headed.Let’s begin with the co-dependent relationship between tobacco companies and the federal government. According to RJ Reynolds (who should know), 2012 federal cigarette excise taxes equaled $14.8 billion out of a total of $43.3 billion in settlement payments, federal, and state and local taxes on cigarettes.Then there are the state and local government tobacco-money addicts. According to one estimate, their excise-tax revenues totaled $17.2 billion in 2011. That’s a lot of incentive not to fund anti-smoking campaigns.And that’s exactly what’s happened over the past few years. Just check the headlines.Tobacco industry efforts to derail effective anti-smoking campaigns (July 11, 2007)Tobacco industry vs. anti-smoking ads (Sept. 2, 2008)State guts funding for anti-tobacco initiatives (Aug. 23, 2011)States Found to Shift Funds From Antismoking Efforts (Dec. 9, 2013)According to that last report, “[various] organizations estimated that states would earn about $25 billion next year in revenue that is linked to tobacco, including $7 billion from settlements between states and leading tobacco companies.“But the groups said that states were expected to spend only $481 million on programs intended to prevent or curb tobacco use, well below the $3.7 billion recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”Can you say “cash cow”?We knew you could.Which brings us back to e-cigarettes, which aren’t even a cash calf at this point.For the most part right now, e-cigarettes are subject only to state sales tax. But, according to USA Today, at least 30 states are considering excise taxes on e-cigs.There’s plenty of debate over whether electronic cigarettes make people more likely to quit smoking real cigarettes or less likely to quit, but almost no one will debate this: Government officials will likely soon be addicted to e-cig tax revenues.No matter how much of a drag it is on public health.Related: John Carroll Twitter Cognoscenti contributorJohn Carroll is a mass communication professor at Boston University and a media analyst for WBUR.More…Support the news	Health

We will assess ourselves and evaluate our local action on tobacco to ensure that local activity follows the latest evidence-based best practice.“We will identify areas for further improvement and demonstrate that by prioritising local activity to tackle tobacco we are contributing to the health and wellbeing of the borough.”One in two regular smokers is killed by tobacco, half die before the age of 70 and a quarter of life long smokers do not get to pick up their pension.By using this website you agree with our terms of use and cookie policy."

	The following is a statement of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, American Heart Association, American Lung Association:
	As organizations committed to reducing tobacco use, the number one cause of preventable death in Ohio, we welcome Gov. John Kasich's concern about this important public health issue. However, we are disappointed that his mid-biennium budget proposal falls far short of the strong action needed to prevent kids from smoking, help smokers quit and reduce tobacco's terrible health and financial toll on Ohio.
	We urge the Governor and Legislature to immediately increase Ohio's tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack and to dedicate a portion of the revenue to programs that are proven to prevent kids from smoking and help smokers quit. The tobacco tax increase should also still include the immediate equalization of tax rates on non-cigarette forms of tobacco, such as cigars, hookah and spit tobacco, which often come in candy flavors and brightly colored packaging which appeal to children. Ohio must take strong action to prevent youth use of all forms of tobacco.
	Tobacco tax increases are a highly effective means of reducing smoking and other tobacco use, but the increase must be large enough to have the desired public health impact. The proposal to increase the cigarette tax over a two year period, from $1.25 to $1.85 per pack, would have little to no effect on smoking rates and would be easily undercut by tobacco industry discounting schemes, such as coupons, buy one get one free deals, and temporary price cuts. We are pleased that the proposal equalizes the tax on all other tobacco products, but to impact public health, this tax should also be immediately enacted and not phased-in over a two-year period. 
	The Governor has taken a positive step forward by proposing to allocate $26.9 million from the Master Settlement Agreement to the Ohio Department of Health for tobacco prevention and cessation programs over a five year span. However, this amount still falls well short of the 
	$132 million a year recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs should be restored at least to the level of $50 million a year that Ohio was providing before funding was severely cut in Fiscal 2009. 
	Ohio was making significant progress in reducing tobacco use until funding for its tobacco prevention program was cut. In recent years, this progress has stalled and today Ohio has the 10th highest smoking rate in the country with 23.3 percent of adults smoking. The high school smoking rate is also higher than the nation as a whole at 21.1 percent. As a result, tobacco takes a huge health and financial toll on Ohio, claiming 17,700 lives each year and costing the state $5.6 billion annually in health care bills. Families and businesses alike pay a heavy price.
	Governor Kasich has started an important conversation about the best way for Ohio to reduce tobacco use and its devastating toll. To have a significant impact, we urge the Governor and Legislature to raise the tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack, equalize tax rates on all tobacco products to the corresponding amount immediately instead of a two-year phased-in period, and to also increase funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs.Campaign for Tobacco-Free KidsPosted in: Healthcare NewsTags: Cancer, Children, Cigar, Cigarette, Electronic Cigarette, Health Care, Heart, Lungs, Public Health, Smoking, TobaccoCancel reply to commentCharles Mazel, PhDAn interview with Charles Mazel, President of NIGHTSEA, conducted by Barbara Foster, The Microscopy & Imaging Place, Inc.Dr. Rajat MukherjeeData science is a marriage between statistical science and informatics, using statistical principals of math and logic on huge volumes of data.Dr. Thomas MuellerDr. Thomas Mueller is the Director of Product Management in the AFM business unit of Bruker’s Nano Surfaces Division.

641	"Today marks National No Smoking Day and the Isle of Wight’s 22,000 smokers are being encouraged to try quitting.The Isle of Wight Council’s public health service is working with Chamber Health and the Island’s Stop Smoking Service to offer advice, support and guidance to smokers to help them quit.A road show is being held in St James’ Square in Newport between 10:30 and 14:00 and also at Cowes Medical Centre between 09:00 and 13:00. At the road show, advisors from Chamber Health will be on hand to give advice on ways to give up smoking.Angela Harding is from Chamber Health and says there’s many incentives to quit. She said:“After just 24 hours of giving up, your lungs already start to clear themselves of nasty substances like nicotine and carbon monoxide. In the following months, people who stopped smoking will find they can breathe easier and stop wheezing.“Giving up can also save lots of money. For example, if you smoked 20 a day but gave up, you would save nearly £3000 a year. Just imagine what you can buy for that. A holiday of a lifetime, a car, a new kitchen for example. The incentives are there and we want to help as many people as possible to quit smoking.”Phil Jordan is the Isle of Wight Council cabinet member responsible for health and added:“I would encourage anyone who wants help or information on the best way to successfully quit to visit the mobile road show tomorrow or call Chamber Health on 554545..“Any scheme to help improve the health of Islander’s is a welcome one and many people will be supported trying to quit smoking.”Since April 2013, the Island’s Stop Smoking Service has supported nearly 2,000 in their quest to quit smoking, with more than half successfully giving up smoking for good. Research shows people are four times more likely to be a successful quitter if they get support through the local stop smoking service.If you have a news story that you think we should know about, then please do not hesitate and get in contact with us.

646	"So you want to give up smoking, but do you know why? ""Because it's bad for you"" isn't good enough. To get motivated, you need a powerful, personal reason to quit. Maybe you want to protect your family from secondhand smoke. Maybe the thought of lung cancer frightens you. Or perhaps you'd like to look and feel younger. Choose a reason that is strong enough to outweigh the urge to light up.It may be tempting to bin your cigarettes and declare you've quit, plain and simple, but going cold turkey isn't easy to do. The reason is that nicotine is addictive. The brain becomes used to having nicotine and craves it. In its absence, the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal occur.When you stop smoking, nicotine withdrawal may make you frustrated, depressed, restless or angry. The craving for 'just one drag' may be overwhelming. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can reduce these feelings. Studies suggest NRT such as nicotine gum, lozenges and patches can help double your chances of stopping successfully when used with an intensive behavioural programme.To ease nicotine withdrawal without using products that contain nicotine, ask your GP about prescription medication. There are tablets that reduce cravings by altering the areas of the brain affected by nicotine. This change may also make smoking less satisfying if you do pick up a cigarette. Other drugs can help reduce troubling withdrawal symptoms, such as depression or the inability to concentrate.Tell your friends, family and work colleagues that you're trying to give up. Their encouragement could make all the difference. The NHS can help with quit kits and other services. Consider joining a support group or talking to a counsellor. Behavioural therapy is a type of counselling that helps you identify and stick to stop-smoking strategies. Combine behavioural therapy with nicotine-replacement products or medication to boost your chances of success.One reason people smoke is that the nicotine helps them relax. Once you give up, you'll need another way to cope with stress. Try getting regular massages, listening to relaxing music or learning yoga or tai chi. If possible, avoid stressful situations during the first few weeks after you stop smoking.Certain activities may trigger your urge to smoke. Alcohol is one of the most common triggers, so try to drink less when you first give up. If coffee is a trigger, change to tea for a few weeks. And if you usually smoke after meals, find something else to do instead, like brushing your teeth or chewing gum.Once you've smoked your last cigarette, throw away all your ashtrays and lighters. Wash any clothes that smell of smoke and clean your carpets, curtains and upholstery. Use air fresheners to help get rid of that familiar odour. It is best not to see or smell anything that reminds you of smoking.It's very common to have a relapse. Many smokers try several times before giving up cigarettes for good. Examine the emotions and circumstances that lead to your relapse. Use this as an opportunity to reaffirm your commitment to stopping. Once you've made the decision to try again, put a 'stop smoking' date in your diary within the next month.Physical activity can reduce nicotine cravings and ease some withdrawal symptoms. When you want to reach for a cigarette, put on your running shoes instead, or just run on the spot. Even light exercise is helpful, such as walking the dog or weeding the garden. The extra calories you burn will also ward off weight gain as you stop smoking.Don't try to diet while giving up cigarettes – too much deprivation is bound to backfire. Instead, focus on eating more fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy products. A US study suggests that these foods make cigarettes taste terrible. This helps you fight your cravings while providing disease-fighting nutrients.In addition to the tremendous health benefits, one of the perks of giving up cigarettes is all the money you will save. Reward yourself by spending part of it on something that's fun.There's more than the financial reward to consider. Cancer Research UK says smoking kills five times more people than road accidents, overdoses, murder, suicide and HIV together. Stopping smoking has immediate health benefits. It lowers your blood pressure and reduces your pulse after only 20 minutes. Within eight hours, oxygen and carbon monoxide levels in your blood return to normal. After two days your sense of taste and smell start to return. Long-term benefits include reduced risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and other cancers.Medically Reviewed by Dr Rob  Hicks on  July 19, 2017

    Given just how well established anti-smoking campaigns in Britain now are, many of today’s smokers, and younger smokers in particular, have taken up the habit with at least some awareness of the damaging consequences of smoking on their long-term health. And despite these campaigns, the number of people smoking is still too high – particularly in Scotland, where, according to the Scottish Health Survey, one in four adults continues to smoke every day compared with around one in five in England and Wales.In comparison to some of the more complex messages that public health campaigns need to get across, such as how many minutes a week we should all be active or how many units of alcohol we should be drinking, the message about tobacco harm is simple. So there is clearly more work to be done and the reasons behind smoking uptake still need to be fully understood.Each year, tobacco use is associated with around a quarter of all deaths in Scotland. It accounts for 56,000 hospital admissions, and costs NHS Scotland £400m in treating smoking-related illnesses. It’s an issue that bears consequences not only on those who smoke, but for Scottish society and its economy.Since the Scottish Health Survey began in 1995, smoking among adults has declined by nearly 10%. The number of cigarettes being smoked has fallen too, from an average of 15-a-day to just over 12. Almost a third (29%) of those who smoke every day are between 25 and 44, making them the largest proportion of smokers. Vast inequalities exist though. Those living in the country’s most deprived areas are more than three times as likely as those living in areas of least deprivation to smoke.In March 2013, the Scottish government published Creating a Tobacco-Free Generation, an ambitious new tobacco control strategy that aims to create a smoke-free Scotland by 2034. The strategy puts Scotland right up there as a world leader on tobacco control. The standardisation of packaging of tobacco products, prohibition of tobacco vending machines, and a restriction on the display of all tobacco and smoking-related products as laid out in the strategy will also all serve to help undermine the marketing efforts of tobacco companies. The first of the strategy’s milestones is to reduce prevalence to 17% by 2016. We therefore have a few more years to wait before we get a sense of just how ambitious the aim for a smoke-free generation is. It should be taken as read that the tobacco industry are watching on with great interest.The increased profile and availability of e-cigarettes has thrown a bit of a spanner in the works. Are they a stepping stone to tobacco use or if properly regulated could they act as a useful alternative to cigarettes? The long-term effects of e-cigarettes are not yet known. They may in time prove to be a useful quitting aid but as yet there is little evidence to support this. In the meantime, sales of e-cigarettes have increased by 340% in the past year while in the same period sales of licensed nicotine replacement products has slowed.The danger lies in e-cigarettes use, or “vaping”, becoming a way of simply replacing one habit, proven to be damaging to health, with an alternative habit, about which little is currently known. Until we know more about their long-term health effects then perhaps the focus should be on discouraging habitual nicotine use more generally. It’s encouraging to see that Glasgow’s Commonwealth Games is the latest event to have banned the use of e-cigarettes from its venues in the same way tobacco smoking has been banned. This follows on from initiatives by other organisations including ScotRail, Starbucks and Wetherspoons pubs, none of whom allow “vaping”.We’ve also changed the Scottish Health Survey in 2014 to include questions on e-cigarette use for the first time. This means we will soon have robust data on the prevalence of e-cigarette use in Scotland, how it varies across different groups in society and how it relates to other health behaviours.A recent EU Directive will also clarify the status of the e-cigarette as a product. The framework allows products to “opt in” to medicines regulation or, failing that, be subject to a range of new controls which include safety and quality requirements as well as restrictions around advertising. With legislation to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to under 18s already passed in England and Wales, it is likely that Scotland will follow soon.There are currently also no specific guidelines governing e-cigarette advertising but the Committee of Advertising Practice recently launched a public consultation on the marketing of e-cigarettes after one prime time advert attracted over 1,000 complaints. The consultation ends in April and any new rules arising out of the consultation are expected to be implemented soon after.The good news is that, according to a recent survey by Ash Scotland, Smoking among young teenagers is at its lowest level since 1990, an indication, perhaps, that this generation has taken more notice of – or been perhaps been more exposed to – effective anti-smoking campaigning.We know from the latest Scottish Health Survey that 73% of smokers would like to stop and 41% have tried to quit on at least three occasions, so most smokers clearly want to change their behaviour. The challenge is to help and support these people give up, protecting others from second-hand exposure and fostering an environment where young people in Scotland do not want to take up smoking. In tandem with this is the challenge for the health community to figure out where e-cigarettes fit in with this in regards nicotine addiction and harm reduction.

            A report warns one in three Cornish smokers is wracked with guilt they could let down their families by dying early.A survey reveals many fear they will miss things like weddings or the birth of grandchildren.On No Smoking Day one Cornish smoker has told Pirate FM ""I wish I never started.""John Woodward is from Brazacott near Egloskerry and first lit up at sixteen: ""One shouldn't have regrets in life but probably starting to smoke was a regret. Once you get hooked on tobacco you continue.I've tried patches, I've tried nicotine substitutes but there is nothing as strong as willpower.""At the end of the day it's willpower and determination that makes you stop.""The survey of more than 1,000 people across the southwest shows more than 1 in 3 smokers (36%) in Cornwall are worried they will experience regret about smoking when facing early death. A third of smokers (32%) fear they will let down those they hold closest by dying early. The research also reveals high levels of anxiety amongst the families and friends of smokers with nearly half of Cornish families and friends (48%) saying they worry their loved one will regret continuing to smoke when faced with an early death. Nearly 1 in 3 people with a smoking relative or friend (28%) are most worried they wouldn’t live long enough to celebrate the joy of major family events such as weddings and the births of children or grandchildren. An overwhelming 7 out of 10 (77%) of smokers’ families and friends in Cornwall want them to quit.In Cornwall, an estimated 92,910 adults still smoke and, in the coming year, around 1,030 are predicted to die of smoking-related diseases.Fiona Andrews, Director of Smokefree South West, said: “This survey confirms that the fear of dying early is very real – not only amongst smokers but amongst their loved ones too. “The risk is big. Half of all smokers will die early as a result of smoking. It is easy to put things off, but it doesn’t have to be this way. As part of our ‘Be There Tomorrow’ campaign, we are urging people in the South West to use No Smoking Day this week to quit the habit before it’s too late. Get in touch with your local NHS Stop Smoking Service for practical support and advice that has already helped hundreds of thousands of people in the South West to break free of tobacco.”Felicity Owen, Director of Public Health for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, added: “These are hard-hitting figures and show how seriously people are taking the consequences of smoking. The good news is that there is plenty of support available locally to help people who want to make that positive decision to quit, for the sake of themselves and their loved ones. Giving up with help is far more effective than trying to do it alone, and the Stop Smoking Team can increase smokers’ chance of being successful.”Well that's different...A fresh safety warning as Mullion remains sealed offPolice say five vehicles collided near BodminIt was submerged in the water at Pentewan SandsCornwall News: Another was taken into custody in St BlazeyCornwall Video News: Officials say they’re holding talks to find new jobs for hundreds of workers in Bodmin.National News: Two powerful panels of MPs are piling pressure on the world's biggest audit firms to disclose their links to Carillion as they prepare to quiz the collapsed construction group's former bosses.Cornwall News: Police say death at Watergate Bay 'isn't suspicious'Showbiz News: Magician David Copperfield has asked fans not to rush to judgement after a model made an allegation of historical sexual assault against him.World News: The world is closer to a nuclear apocalypse than it was last year, according to the 2018 position of the symbolic Doomsday Clock.Sports News: Jose Mourinho has signed a new contract with Manchester United to keep him at the club until 2020, with the option of a further year.Strange News: The world is closer to a nuclear apocalypse than it was last year, according to the 2018 position of the symbolic Doomsday Clock.Cornwall News: St Ives' MP wants more help to deal with damage in places like Penzance and ScillyCornwall News: 15 firefighters scrambled to accident near Bodmin  © Copyright

652	"by Ken QuintanillaGuam - Electronic cigarettes have become increasingly popular throughout the nation and it's no different here on Guam. But because they're highly unregulated, it's fallen into the hands of our island's youth. Legislation aims to prevent just that.Senator Dennis Rodriguez Jr. says while there's still a lot of unknown information about electronic cigarettes, it's better to air on the side of caution. ""When it comes to the protection of children and minors, this is the way we would like to go and protect them,"" he said.Bill 264 would prohibit the sale or distribution of e-cigarettes to minors. Chuck Tanner from the Guam Comprehensive Cancer Control Coalition dispelled the several myths people may have about e-cigarettes one of which is that it's safer. ""Non-smokers of tobacco products may be at risk to addition for smoking electronic cigarettes in addition, although electronic cigarettes don't generate smoke via burning tobacco it does not mean it's not safer to use to conventional cigarettes,"" he said. Peter Cruz from the Tobacco Control Team of the Non-Communicable Disease Consortium says its this kind of misguided information that has caused the surge of popularity in e-cigarettes. Cruz stresses the main ingredient of e-cigarettes is still nicotine. ""Currently, the CDC has an estimate of 25 percent of high school students have used electronic cigarette big tobacco companies have found yet another method of delivery specifically aimed for the younger generation of society the absence of regulatory monitoring has put this population at dire risk it's accessibility, simplicity of operation and endless amount of flavors or commonly known as e-juicing has made this product so popular with the youth,"" he said.The current usage of e-cigarettes has been reported to be highly prevalent among Guam's middle and high school students. And for Public Health director James Gillan, he believes Bill 264 needs to be stronger. ""This does not go far enough, it's a tobacco product, it's been deemed to be a tobacco product by FDA and I think we ought to tax it as such,"" he said. Gillan has already prohibited the use of e-cigarettes in any Public Health building. And while those who sell e-cigarettes were against the taxing suggestion, Vape Guam owner Evan Diras says even without the regulations, he's treated e-cigarettes like other tobacco products and doesn't sell to minors. ""I can speak for the rest of the other stores that are open, we all agreed that we don't sell to minors before this thing ever came up yes, we see a lot of minors using the e-cigarettes, but I think its beyond our control,"" he said. Gillan meanwhile says the FDA is set to roll out regulations in late spring. A number of states like California, Colarado and Maryland have passed measures banning the sale of e-cigarettes to minors whereas Hawaii, Iowa and New York have pending legislation under consideration.

An advert for an e-cigarette brand has been banned after the advertising watchdog ruled that claims including that it was ""the healthier smoking alternative"" could not be substantiated.Wednesday's ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority comes as it looks to introduce new regulations for e-cigarette marketing to clear up uncertainty in the market.The leaflet for Ten Motives' disposable electronic cigarettes claimed they were ""the healthier smoking alternative"" and ""because it contains no tar or cancerous toxins, you can still enjoy smoking without worrying about the effects on your health"".The ad was challenged over whether these claims could be substantiated.In its defence, Ten Motives argued that e-cigarettes were a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, saying that its product contained none of the 4,000 or so harmful toxins and carcinogens found in conventional tobacoo-based products.It pointed out that regulator Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had confirmed that it was acceptable to refer to its products as a healthier alternative.It also cited a briefing document from the public health charity Ash (Action on Smoking and Health) that stated ""people smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar"".Ten Motives also provided links to presentations given at an e-cigarette summit in November 2013 at the Royal Society, which it said had been attended by recognised international scientific authorities on smoking, including the MHRA.It highlighted quotes and presentations that it said supported the ad's claims, including a science-based independent presentation, ""Nicotine safety in the context of e-cigarette use and tobacco dependance"".In its ruling, the ASA noted the two claims in the ad were understood to mean the Ten Motive's products were less harmful than conventional cigarettes.But it ruled that the ad should be banned, as although it acknowledged the quote from Ash, it noted it was not supported by further documentation or substantiation showing the effects of e-cigarettes or the Ten Motives products specifically.Likewise, it said the summit presentations did not deal specifically with Ten Motives products.In its ruling, the ASA concluded the claims ""the healthier smoking alternative"" and ""you can still enjoy smoking without worrying about the effects on your health"" were misleading and the ad should be banned.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

655	" It's common knowledge that smoking is bad for your health - but it's not just people with heavy habits who could be puffing their way towards problems. This year's No Smoking Day is urging part-time smokers to quit too, writes Abi Jackson   EVERY year since the campaign began in 1983, No Smoking Day has been rallying smokers to stub out for good and charities in Ireland and Britain are hoping to inspire even higher numbers this year.  But it's not just those with 40-a-day habits being targeted; this year the focus is shifting to include part-time and social smokers. Because while the past few decades have seen a wealth of research highlighting the dangers of being a heavy smoker, the increased risk of certain cancers being most notable, there has been very little emphasis on 'light' smokers.  A recent study, published this year in the Smoking In Britain journal, looking at non-daily smoking and common misconceptions, revealed that awareness of potential health risks of part-time smoking is low. Only a quarter (25 per cent) of the non-daily smokers surveyed said they were worried that cigarettes might be damaging their health, while the significant majority were unconcerned.  Mike Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF), isn't surprised by the findings. ""People often think, including some doctors actually, 'Well, if you only smoke a bit, it's not going to do you too much harm',"" he says. ""Part of that is driven by the lack of evidence; most research is done on people who smoke more. ""We don't say enough about part-time smoking.""  There may be less data on the health risks of part-time smoking, but that doesn't mean none exists. A major 2005 study, which followed thousands of men and women from  the 1970s through to 2002, looking at the consequences of smoking between one and four cigarettes a day, revealed heart-disease deaths were three times higher than in people who didn't smoke at all. These two studies alone are cause for concern for the BHF. ""I think we can say with confidence that, one, there is damage being done [if you're a part-time smoker] and, two, awareness of that is pretty low,"" Dr Knapton says. ""So this is an important message to get out there.""  There may be 'guidelines' for sensible consumption levels for alcohol, for instance, but when it comes to smoking, Dr Knapton's view is clear - there is no such thing as a 'safe' lower limit. ""An unequivocal no,"" he says. ""There's no safe limit as far as we're aware.""  There are more than one million part-time smokers in Britain and Northern Ireland. The non-daily smoking survey also found that just one in seven (15 per cent) of them feel they're addicted to cigarettes, compared to one in three daily smokers.  Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, however, and whether or not somebody experiences powerful physical cravings, smoking can be a very tough habit to break.  ""It becomes a social or psychological habit too - you have a cup of tea and a cigarette, for instance, and that becomes difficult to change over time,"" Dr Knapton says.  Reasons for part-time smoking vary. Some say it's a stress reliever, or to help them cope with they're anxious. For many, it's a social thing - lighting up with colleagues during a work break, joining in with other smokers on a night out; having something to hold and 'do' can be a comfort in itself.  Despite the low number of 'light' smokers admitting to health worries, two in five (40 per cent) said they've tried to quit in the past year.  n  continues overleaf

656	"Chancellor urged to raise tobacco taxes – a call echoed by ex-smokers Health campaigners and academic experts are marking this year’s No Smoking Day by calling on the Chancellor to raise the tax on cigarettes by 5% above inflation in next week’s Budget. This coincides with research released today by the British Heart Foundation showing that nearly half (42%) of ex-smokers said that raising the tax on tobacco would help other smokers to quit. In a submission endorsed by 80 health and welfare organisations as well as Directors of Public Health, ASH and the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies are calling for the following measures:Ø Introduce a tobacco tax escalator of 5% above inflation for this and subsequent years.Ø Reduce the growing price differential between the most expensive and cheapestcigarettes to discourage down-tradingØ Increase the tax on hand-rolled tobacco (HRT) by introducing a larger tax escalator of 15% above inflation until tax on HRT is equivalent to that on manufactured cigarettes.Ø Support the development of regulations to introduce plain, standardisedpackaging of tobacco packs.Ø Update the Government’s anti-smuggling strategyDeborah Arnott, Chief Executive of health charity ASH said:- “Raising the price of tobacco through taxation is the most effective way of reducing smoking and saving lives. Increasing taxes is a win-win for Government: it raises much needed revenue and encourages smokers to quit a deadly addiction. That is why we are calling on the Chancellor to be bold and raise the tax by 5% above inflation to further motivate smokers to quit.”Professor Anna Gilmore, Professor of Public Health at the University of Bath and a UKCTAS Public Health Researcher the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, said:- “Tobacco companies constantly complain about tax rises while at the same time quietly increasing prices and amassing huge profits from the sale of a product that kills half their long-term customers. This shows there is scope for raising tobacco tax. Increasing taxes not only helps smokers to quit but also deters children from starting a life-long addiction.”

An estimated one million people across the UK have swapped smoking for ‘vaping’. To mark national No Smoking Day, reporter Alexa Copeland swapped her pack of menthols for an e-cigarette to find out how they are helping so many people kick the habit.

  I have never wanted to give up smoking to be perfectly honest. Life can be miserable enough without depriving oneself of its simple pleasures and for me, pleasurable moments invariably involve cigarettes. Especially the one that gets you started in the morning. And the one with a relaxing cup of tea or a glass of wine at the end of the day, and the one that stops you cracking when you’re nearing your stress limit. And, well, you get my point.

  I know it’s not big, and it’s certainly not clever, but I’ve always enjoyed my cigarettes. And in a perverse way, the more we smokers are made to feel like social lepers through bans and regulation, the more my resolve strengthened to continue the habit. Smoking isn’t illegal, it contributes billions to the treasury and the constant hounding of the sociable souls who indulge feels a bit too much like a Nanny State-sponsored witch-hunt for my liking. And that is something I like to rail against most passionately.

  Alas, I was forced to re-evaluate my attitude a couple of weeks ago when I was plagued with a chest infection almost matched in severity by my doctor’s words. She did not explicitly link the infection with smoking, but her stern insinuation that I was setting myself up for a grim future of pain and breathlessness from ineffectual lungs was enough to make me seriously think about what I was doing to myself.

  Being a somewhat reluctant quitter, I didn’t much fancy my chances of giving up easily. Although I don’t smoke heavily – around seven per day unless alcohol is involved – my habit stretches back over a decade and is truly ingrained in my daily routine. Nicotine patches and gum may work for some, but I knew I’d miss the physical ritual of smoking, so I joined the tens of thousands of people around the country who are replacing their smoking with ‘vaping’.

  Vaping is the term given to the use of electronic cigarettes; also known as vapourisers or e-cigs. These devices come in a range of styles offering different flavours and nicotine doses. E-cigs work by vapourising a liquid solution which contains nicotine, thus allowing users to effectively mimic taking a drag on a cigarette to get their nicotine hit. The ‘smoke’ exhaled is largely water vapour and e-cigs are marketed as a much safer alternative to conventional cigarettes as they do not contain tar or carcinogens.

  One man keen to extol their virtues is businessman Alan O’Neill who was quick to capitalise on the early popularity of the product. Mr O’Neill bought his own vapouriser online about 18-months-ago and within 30 days his 30-a-day habit was history. He then set about bringing e-cigs to the North-East and now owns E-ciggy shops in Darlington, Stockton, Middlesbrough and Washington. He says business is growing from strength to strength as more and more smokers turn to vaping.

  He said: “You get customers coming back to tell you how long they’ve gone without a cigarette, while some come back to say thank you for helping them quit and it feels fantastic to get feedback like that. I’ve found that a proportion of users want to quit completely, but a proportion are quite happy to just carry on using the e-cigs as an alternative to smoking. I switched because I wanted to stop the negative health and financial effects of smoking but I still wanted the pleasure of smoking. In that way it was a fantastic solution and I just thought this incredible product should be more widely available.”

  Unfortunately for Mr O’Neill and the estimated one million ‘vapers’ in Britain, uncertainty surrounds the product’s future, with bodies such as the British Medical Association and World Health Organisation expressing safety concerns. The main issue is that unlike nicotine patches and gum, e-cigs are not regulated in the same way as medicines. This means there are no rules when it comes to the purity of the nicotine and so forth. Last month MEPs voted to restrict the availability of e-cigs in the future and it remains to be seen how many pubs and clubs will allow vaping on their premises if it is deemed to be harmful.

  For me, switching to an e-cigarette has been unbelievably painless. In the three days since I started vaping I have had just two real cigarettes. I would normally have had at least 20 in that time. Maybe it’s the novelty factor, or maybe, despite my protestations to the contrary, it was just the right time for me to give up, but whatever the reason I have no doubt that the e-cigarette has helped enormously. It fits into my routine in the same way that real cigarettes did and I find myself enjoying my ‘e-cig moments’ almost as much as I savored the real thing.

  And if the future of vapourising is threatened by government legislation and public bans, well, I still have something to rail against don’t I? And I do believe I shall do that most passionately.

Some are made from clay, others from ornately carved metals or plastics. But the principle is same — these water pipes allow you to smoke flavored tobacco as it is bubbled through water.Sharing a water pipe is thought to be harmless, relaxing fun. But that’s just one of the myths about these pipes.Myth: Smoking on a hookah is less harmful than smoking cigarettes.Truth: Hookah smoke is just as dangerous as cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke is generated by burning tobacco, while hookah smoke is produced by heating tobacco in a bowl using charcoal. The end product is the same — smoke, containing carcinogens.Myth: Hookah smoke does not contain nicotine.Truth: Tobacco is tobacco, no matter what. Shisha is often soaked in molasses or honey and mixed with fruit, but it still contains cancer-causing chemicals and nicotine.Myth: The water purifies hookah smoke.Truth: Smoking tobacco through water does not filter out cancer-causing chemicals. Water-filtered smoke can damage the lungs and heart as much as cigarette smoke. In fact, in a 60-minute hookah session, smokers are exposed to 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette.In recent years, there has been an increase in hookah use around the world, most notably among youth and among university students.The problem is, studies show that youthful experimentation with tobacco often turns into a lifelong habit. Some 88 percent of adults who smoke say they started smoking by the age of 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.New forms of hookah smoking, including hookah pens, have been introduced. Like electronic cigarettes, these battery-powered devices turn liquid containing nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals into a vapor, which is inhaled. Little information on their use or their health risks is currently available.Whether you call it shisha, nargile or hookah, it might smell nice, but it is not as harmless as you might think. Hookah smoking should never be considered a safe alternative to smoking cigarettes.Sara Rehmer works with the Tobacco Use Prevention Program at RiverStone Health.

Electronic cigarette use is exploding among adolescents, and the latest evidence indicates this is not good. A study published last week in JAMA Pediatrics found youth e-cigarette users had higher odds of being tobacco smokers, progressing from experimentation to established smoking; were more likely to be heavier smokers; and were less likely to have quit smoking than smokers who did not also use e-cigarettes.“What is particularly concerning,” study co-author Lauren Dutra said in an interview,“is that 20 percent of middle school students who tried an e-cigarette had never tried a real cigarette. E-cigarette ads reach teenagers at an age when the brain is really vulnerable to nicotine.”Dutra and co-author Stanton Glantz from the University of California, San Francisco said more studies need to be done, and critics were quick to leap on the results as inconclusive. E-cigarette manufacturers and public health advocates who hope the devices offer a safer alternative to tobacco say the study did not prove e-cigs directly cause more tobacco smoking.E-cigarettes are battery-powered heating devices that deliver nicotine vapor to users. Big Tobacco hopes to sell them as a revolution in health. Murray Kessler, CEO of Lorillard, maker of the popular Blu, boasted last month that the e-cigarette will be“one of the greatest harm-reduction opportunities ever presented to a smoker.”Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more.But that is not happening. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of youths in grades six to 12 who tried e-cigarettes more than doubled from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent between 2011 to 2012. Dual use among youths was extremely high, with 76 percent of e-cigarette users also smoking tobacco cigarettes.Tim McAfee, the CDC’s director of Smoking and Health, said,“We must keep our youth from experimenting or using any tobacco product. These dramatic increases suggest that developing strategies to prevent marketing, sales, and use of e-cigarettes among youth is critical.”Everyone agrees e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional carcinogenic cigarettes. But the chemicals in e-cigarettes have never been conclusively tested for their own risk.That has allowed e-cig companies to flood the market with devices that come in a variety of fruit, spice, candy, and dessert flavorings that the FDA banned in tobacco cigarettes because they were clearly targeted at adolescents.They are also getting away with racy ads no longer allowed for tobacco. Anti-smoking advocates cite an ad for Blu in Sports Illustrated’s current swimsuit edition. It shows the lower torso of a woman with the product’s logo on the middle of her bikini bottom, with text saying,“Slim, Charged, Ready to Go.”The marketing is so slick that The New York Times reported last week that the number of teenagers using e-cigarettes may be vastly underestimated. Many adolescents who say they never have smoked an e-cigarette actually have, under other names such as“hookah” and“vape” pens.Many cities are trying to treat e-cigarettes like tobacco. Boston was one of the first in 2011 to ban sales to minors and prohibit vaping in workplaces, and 100 municipalities have some level of restrictions. Last week, Los Angeles followed suit.But without federal regulation, the hip marketing of e-cigarettes will overwhelm public health efforts. Boston is part of a coalition of cities that is about to ask the FDA to finally regulate e-cigarettes. Barbara Ferrer, Boston’s public health commissioner, said,“I don’t think they’re safe. No one should be talking about these products as a tool for smoking cessation until they are tested and regulated. We’re seeing much more usage out there, but when kids don’t even know the name of what they are using, they’re being sold a bill of goods.”When the kids do not know what they’re smoking, that is a public health emergency. The FDA must regulate these products before a new generation vapes itself into a nicotine haze.

660	"While not snuffed out entirely, e-cigarettes took a hit at Tuesday's El Cajon City Council meeting when the council voted 4-1 to amend the Municipal Code so that regulations about usage and sale of the devices are the same as those that apply to tobacco and smoking.Additionally, a license to sell vapor products will now be required, as is currently the case with tobacco. Businesses that primarily sell electronic/vapor inhalation products also will need a conditional use permit, a requirement that now applies to smoke shops. Minors are prohibited from buying and using e-cigarettes and similar products.E-cigarette use increasingly snuffed outElectronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that can provide doses of nicotine and other additives in an aerosol. They are largely unregulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They come in flavors ranging from apple pie to white chocolate.City Councilman Gary Kendrick, who brought the issue forward in January, reiterated his stance that e-cigarettes and similarly used hookah pens and pipes, with their sweet flavors and easy over-the-counter availability, entice kids and create future cigarette smokers. Hookah use with any tobacco product, weed or plant is already prohibited in enclosed public places and in certain outdoor public areas.""We have the opportunity to stop these e-cigs in their track,"" Kendrick said, who added that ""having a smoking section in a restaurant is like having a peeing section in a pool.""El Cajon for years has had some of the most comprehensive smoking restrictions in San Diego County. Smoking is not allowed in any public place in El Cajon, including common areas in multi-unit residences; on city sidewalks, streets and stores; in common areas of malls; in enclosed and unenclosed areas of hotels, motels and places of business; or in bars, restaurants and public accommodations. There are specified ""smoking stations"" in the downtown area.A dozen people spoke in favor of El Cajon taking a stand against e-cigarettes, including Cajon Valley School District Superintendent David Miyashiro, who urged the council to be ""most protective of our youth.""Several students from area high schools said that easy access has helped increase the use of e-cigarettes among teenagers and gave personal anecdotes to drive home their points.""It's becoming increasingly popular, I see it all over at the mall and it's a nuisance to me,"" said Staci Francis, a senior at Santana High school who lives in El Cajon. ""My peers don't see it as harmful, that it's just vapor, just water.""Speakers from Communities Against Substance Abuse shared statistics about the growth of the smoke-free devices and said little is known about long-term health effects related to e-cigarette use. They also warned against the ""newest trend"" of using e-cigarettes as a means of inhaling high levels of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, from butane hash oil.CASA representatives also praised the city, which has for years been very active in regulating tobacco sales and restricting smoking in most public places. ""You're the leaders for public health,"" said Lorenzo Higley of CASA ""(The council has) demonstrated with your leadership that protecting El Cajon citizens is a priority. This council has made a real public health contribution protecting the citizens of El Cajon.""Kendrick said he believed ""that the primary responsibility of government is to protect the citizens -- especially children.""Mayor Bill Wells cast the lone dissenting voice on the matter, saying he felt that the regulation was ""government overreach"" and that he was concerned that next it would be illegal to ride skateboards, horses or drive in cars without helmets and that it wasn't a City Council's job ""to make sure we do everything we can so nobody gets hurt.""Wells said he took issue not with the way the council had ""attacked cigarettes"" but its stance on ""e-cigs' water vapor."" He said he had read ""conflicting"" information about their harm. He said he is in favor of banning the sale of e-cigarettes to minors."	Health

  MORE than 100,000 people would quit smoking in one year alone if the Chancellor increased the tax on cigarettes to 5% above inflation, according to 80 leading health charities and experts.

  In a report released ahead of next week's Budget, campaigners are calling on Chancellor George Osborne to increase the tobacco ""tax escalator"" from 2% to 5% above inflation year on year.

  The move would net the Government an extra £485 million in the first year and £7.4bn over the next five years, it said.

  Furthermore, it said the number of smokers would fall by 104,000 in the first year, with a reduction in deaths from smoking of 479.

  A 15% rise above inflation for hand-rolled tobacco would lead to even more lives saved, far fewer smokers and further revenue, it added.

  The report, from the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) and the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, is backed by NHS groups of doctors, directors of public health, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and the Royal College of Physicians.

  Charities including the British Heart Foundation (BHF), Cancer Research UK, and the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation also back the study.

  It comes as a poll of more than 2000 former smokers for the BHF found 42% believed raising the tax on tobacco would help other smokers quit.

  Over two in five (43%) said GPs should approach the subject more often with smokers during routine appointments, while 35% called for more information about local stop-smoking services.

  Nearly one-third (30%) said reducing the number of smoking scenes in TV programmes and films would help people quit, while 34% wanted more information in gyms, offices and leisure centres.

662	Government agencies are increasingly snuffing out “vaping” or puffing on electronic cigarettes in public spaces.On Tuesday, the Del Mar Fairgrounds board and the El Cajon City Council approved restricting their use. Solana Beach, Vista, Carlsbad, Poway, La Mesa, Encinitas and Lemon Grove also have or are set to include “e-cigs” in their smoking-control ordinances.2194 total votes.The San Diego City Council may take similar action later this year. City Councilman Mark Kersey wants to ban their use inside Petco Park and Qualcomm Stadium and all other city facilities. He also wants to prohibit allowing their sale from vending machines, and require a permit for all dealers.In Sacramento, a bill to ban electronic smoking in all public buildings and enact other regulations is wending its way through the Legislature.El Cajon regulates use, sales of e-cigarettesAnd the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next month is expected to issue long-awaited regulations some seven years after the products first emerged.The San Diego County Board of Supervisors also addressed electronic cigarettes and other vapor devices Tuesday, treating them like tobacco products and targeting their use in its health policies and smoking cessation efforts. But regulating them in the workplace or restaurants remains a matter of state law, according to county officials.For the electronic cigarette industry, the legislative curtailments are an overreaction to what it says is a non-existent problem.“We are not in favor of any restrictions, but we understand them,” said Thomas Kiklas of The Vapor and Electronic Cigarette Association. “They can’t ban the products sale or use, but they can restrict it in public places.”Kiklas co-owns NICMAXX Electronic Cigarettes and is engaged in industry advocacy efforts throughout the nation.He maintains that while e-cigarettes are a nicotine product, the vapor they produce is not akin to second-hand tobacco smoke.“When someone vapes in public it is not harming anyone,” he said.Not everyone agrees, while others say more research is needed.E-cigarettes are banned for sale to minors, but health officials say they are increasingly alarmed that the products are being marketed using images drawn from games popular with kids such as Angry Birds. They also say the devices are being used to smoke marijuana, hash oil and other illegal drugs.That was part of the issue front and center for the county supervisors Tuesday, who voted 3-1 to equate electronic smoking devices with tobacco.Supervisor Dave Roberts said there are also too many unknowns about potential health problems to allow unrestricted use of e-cigs. He argued electronic cigarettes are a gateway to regular tobacco use because they are primarily used to ingest nicotine.“The county should be a model, and I cannot support a product that promotes addiction,” he said.In May, the county will consider another layer to its policy by prohibiting all electronic smoking devices at all county facilities.Supervisor Bill Horn cast the lone “no” vote, citing e-cigarettes as a tool for people to quit regular cigarettes.“It is a knee-jerk reaction to something that is taking place and I don’t think we should be telling adults you can’t use these if you are trying to get off nicotine,” Horn said.The board’s vote came after numerous speakers urged action and Dr. Wilma Wooten, county public health officer, said sales of the products have tripled in recent years and that about 7 percent of middle and high school students are illegally using them.California’s Health and Safety Code makes it illegal to sell or furnish e-cigs to anyone under 18 and allows local jurisdictions to pass and enforce laws governing their distribution.The fair board voted 6-0 to ban use of the products during the county fair, which opens June 7 and runs through July 6. The move comes after it banned smoking at the fair last year. The prohibition does not apply to Del Mar Thoroughbred Club races or fairgrounds’ special events.Board members said adding e-cigarettes to the policy was partly an issue of enforcement.“I would feel sorry for the security personnel trying to distinguish cigarettes from e-cigarettes,” said fair board vice president David Watson. “If we’re going to do it, we’re going to do it 100 percent.”In El Cajon, the City Council vote was 4-1 with Mayor Bill Wells opposing.The city will now require those-cigarette and related product sellers to get a license, as is the case with tobacco sellers. Businesses that primarily sell electronic vapor inhalation products will need a conditional use permit similar to what’s required of smoke shops in the city.Staff writer Edward Sifuentes and Karen Pearlman contributed to this report.

Last week LA voted to follow New York's example and ban electronic cigarettes in all public spaces.
It's bad news for celebs in the showbiz city, such as Simon Cowell and Katherine Heigl who've all been snapped 'vaping'. Poor Leonardo DiCaprio, who has homes in LA and New York, will now be forced to stub out his smokeless cigarettes on both sides of the country.But the craze for e-cigarettes hasn't just been taken up by the stars. New research shows that more than 50,000 Irish smokers are estimated to have made the switch from tobacco to e-cigarettes in a global industry worth in excess of €1.1 bn.Galway businessman Declan Connolly set up his electronic cigarette company, ezSmoke (ezsmoke.ie), two years ago after swapping to vaping following 27 years as a smoker.""I bought a device online and people started asking me where I'd got it – that's how the business started,"" he explains.Although the first smokeless non-tobacco cigarette was patented as early as 1963, the modern device, which uses battery-generated cartridges to heat a liquid (usually infused with nicotine) and create a vapour, appeared around 2004 in China.Declan Connolly reckons we're now into a third generation of electronic devices.""The first generation was the disposable ones in the shops that look like cigarettes, now the more popular devices are those based around a rechargeable battery. But there's a third generation that's sprung up with enthusiasts creating coils and heating elements to make their own devices –there are a lot of hobbyists out there.""But aside from the techies, the biggest fans of e-cigarettes are former smokers. Although the devices aren't sold as quit-smoking aids, Connolly admits his main demographic of buyers are people who have smoked for 10-30 years and want to get away from tobacco.""One of the big appeals for these buyers is that when you inhale an e-cigarette you feel a bit of a 'kick' in the back of your throat,"" he explains. ""It also provides the hand-to-mouth ritual, and then there's the fact that most people starting off will try and find a flavour of e-liquid that replicates what they used to smoke.""But the close parallels between vapour cigarettes and the real thing has thrown up some problems with legislation.In December, New York City banned e-cigarettes in all places where regular cigarettes are already prohibited.In Dublin, DIT's health and safety department banned electronic cigarettes on campus in November. ""Reaction from students has been quite polarised,"" says Al McConnell, editor of The Edition, the college's independent newspaper which broke the story of the ban. ""It's also been difficult to enforce as e-cigarettes' popularity continues to rise. You can see that on campus, they're becoming more popular among students.""He adds: ""I think it's a tricky issue because of the inherent uncertainty around the products. The Students' Union is currently working on its own research into e-cigarettes before it takes any stance and I think the ban, and DIT's smoking policy, will have to be returned to when more is known about them.""Which is, of course, the greatest area of concern – in a new product, where the effects have not been measured over any lengthy period of time, who knows how safe vaping really is?The Irish Cancer Society (ICS) has refused to endorse the product. Health Minister James Reilly has announced that he plans to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to under 18s over concerns that puffing on a pseudo-cigarette could prove a gateway to smoking the real thing.It's a fear, that ezSmoke's Declan Connolly, who doesn't sell to under 18s, strongly denies. ""I'd like to rubbish that idea that vaping is a gateway to smoking. If someone tried e-cigarettes, they would never become a smoker. Vaping tastes nicer and it's cheaper,"" he says.""Health's a major reason why people turn to e-cigarettes over smoking. It's combustion that causes all the trouble in cigarettes but e-cigarettes have vapour, not smoke and there's no tar. Vaping won't re-normalise smoking because it's completely different.""Tobacco-related disease accounts for some 5,500 deaths in Ireland every year, with tobacco consumption the biggest cause of cancer and chest diseases and a significant factor in cardiovascular disease and exacerbated diabetes.But eliminating tobacco doesn't necessarily mean nicotine infused e-cigarettes are healthy because nicotine is a vasoconstrictor that narrows the blood vessels, raises blood pressure and is also highly addictive.'In the absence of appropriate regulation and evidence, we can't recommend e-cigarettes,"" says Kevin O'Hagan, health promotion manager at the ICS. ""They may not have the many poisonous, cancer-causing chemicals that tobacco smoke has, but it's unclear what the long term health impacts are."" He adds: ""E-cigarettes are marketed as recreational consumer products. They make no claims for quitting and they're not currently a proven form of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT).""Until their effectiveness as smoking cessation aids is established and we can be assured that they don't cause any harm to the user or any health risks of second-hand exposure, we're urging people to take caution in using them.""Ultimately the ICS would like to see e-cigarettes regulated under medicinal products or medical devices legislation, something retailers like Declan Connolly are keen to avoid.""I'm all for regulation, there are some poorer quality products out there and people need to know that what they're inhaling is safe and approved,"" he explains.""But I would hate e-cigarettes to go down the medicine regulation route because people who vape aren't sick.""Nor is he happy with the devices being included under the current EU Tobacco Products Directive, which may bring with it limitations on devices size and the amount of nicotine that can be included.""I'd like to see e-cigarettes regulated under a separate category, because they're not a tobacco product, but it's a growing industry and pharmaceutical companies are lobbying viciously to get them made a medicine and tobacco companies are also lobbying – there are interesting times ahead.""'All my family have switched to e-cigs' Mum-of-two Myriam Prendergast (49) from Tipperary town was one of a family of smokers before she discovered vaping. Now they've all converted to e-cigarettes, she explains.""I bought an electronic cigarette for my mum to try two years ago. She's 70 and had been a smoker all her life but since trying vaping, she's been off them.""My dad switched to e-cigarettes too; so did my husband and my daughter – it was listening to all them sing their praises that persuaded me to give them a go.""I haven't smoked a cigarette now in four months and when I went to the doctor to get my carbon monoxide levels checked, they'd gone down drastically.""Instead of smoking a cigarette that has 4,000 chemicals in it, I'm inhaling a vapour that has three flavours and nicotine – and although I started off on 24mg of nicotine I'm now down to 16mg.""I like how I still get the sensation of smoking a cigarette. I can have one with my morning coffee or after a meal and I'm not pulling my hair out wanting a smoke.""IT consultant Hugh McCormick (53) from Ballycastle, Co Antrim, has saved €2,500 since switching from smoking to vaping last October.He says: ""My main reason for making the switch was down to health concerns. I'd been smoking for almost 40 years and I felt like I was playing Russian Roulette with my health.""But saving money has been a nice bonus; instead of spending €140 a week on cigarettes I'm spending about €10 on juice.""I found ezSmoke online and deliberately chose an e-juice close in flavour to the brand of cigarette I smoked.""For the first time I'm convinced I'll never touch a tobacco product again.""Hopefully in time I'll let go off nicotine completely – I've already reduced the level – but I'm not too worried if I don't stop vaping.""

Shelly Kiser, American Lung Association, 740-739-0187Groups urge tobacco tax increase of $1.50, more funding for tobacco preventionStatement of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, American Heart Association,  and American Lung AssociationAs organizations committed to reducing tobacco use, the number one cause of preventable death in Ohio, we welcome Gov. John Kasich's concern about this important public health issue. However, we are disappointed that his mid-biennium budget proposal falls far short of the strong action needed to prevent kids from smoking, help smokers quit and reduce tobacco's terrible health and financial toll on Ohio.We urge the Governor and Legislature to immediately increase Ohio's tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack and to dedicate a portion of the revenue to programs that are proven to prevent kids from smoking and help smokers quit. The tobacco tax increase should also still include the immediate equalization of tax rates on non-cigarette forms of tobacco, such as cigars, hookah and spit tobacco, which often come in candy flavors and brightly colored packaging which appeal to children. Ohio must take strong action to prevent youth use of all forms of tobacco.Tobacco tax increases are a highly effective means of reducing smoking and other tobacco use, but the increase must be large enough to have the desired public health impact. The proposal to increase the cigarette tax over a two year period, from $1.25 to $1.85 per pack, would have little to no effect on smoking rates and would be easily undercut by tobacco industry discounting schemes, such as coupons, buy one get one free deals, and temporary price cuts. We are pleased that the proposal equalizes the tax on all other tobacco products, but to impact public health, this tax should also be immediately enacted and not phased-in over a two-year period.The Governor has taken a positive step forward by proposing to allocate $26.9 million from the Master Settlement Agreement to the Ohio Department of Health for tobacco prevention and cessation programs over a five year span. However, this amount still falls well short of the 
$132 million a year recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs should be restored at least to the level of $50 million a year that Ohio was providing before funding was severely cut in Fiscal 2009.Ohio was making significant progress in reducing tobacco use until funding for its tobacco prevention program was cut. In recent years, this progress has stalled and today Ohio has the 10th highest smoking rate in the country with 23.3 percent of adults smoking. The high school smoking rate is also higher than the nation as a whole at 21.1 percent. As a result, tobacco takes a huge health and financial toll on Ohio, claiming 17,700 lives each year and costing the state $5.6 billion annually in health care bills. Families and businesses alike pay a heavy price.Governor Kasich has started an important conversation about the best way for Ohio to reduce tobacco use and its devastating toll. To have a significant impact, we urge the Governor and Legislature to raise the tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack, equalize tax rates on all tobacco products to the corresponding amount immediately instead of a two-year phased-in period, and to also increase funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs.

666	"We are about to encounter a significant rise in annual healthcare costs, courtesy of Big Tobacco.Recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force endorsed lung cancer screening with annual CT scans in high-risk smokers. This means that insurers will soon be required by law to fund these services, which screen for cancers caused by cigarettes, to the tune of $2 billion per year.The tobacco industry, while fully aware that their products maim and kill multitudes of Americans daily, will happily shoulder none of the burden.  Instead, while tobacco profits continue to soar, these millions of expensive CT scans will be paid for with hard-earned healthcare dollars.Shouldn't Big Tobacco blood money be used to cover these costs?Tobacco companies have historically absolved themselves of responsibility for these multitudes of deaths by arguing that smokers choose to smoke. This absurd position disregards the fact that the industry systematically employs all means at its disposal -- marketing experts, unscrupulous attorneys, ""scientists"" -- to obscure the facts regarding the known dangers of cigarettes so as to minimize tobacco avoidance and quit rates.To date, government has turned a blind eye to Big Tobacco, an industry that continues to enjoy a historically lucrative run, despite the fact that they're literally killing us.It seems that only the court of public opinion can provide the leverage necessary to extract the enormous debt owed by these nefarious corporations.Perhaps it's time to write our leaders in Congress to ask that they send this $2 billion annual bill to Big Tobacco. After all, they can afford it.Larry Leibowitzhealth directorRedding"	Health

669	"In the 50 years since the Surgeon General first reported on the dangers of smoking tobacco, much has been done to effect change. At the time of the first Surgeon General’s Report, 42 percent of American adults smoked. Today, only 18 percent do.That’s according to the 50th Anniversary Surgeon General’s Report released in January.But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to list tobacco use as the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. And young people today continue to pick up the habit.          Listen  Listening...              / 24:10   A discussion about new guidelines to help communities control tobacco use and addiction.   Last month Washington University’s Center for Public Health Systems Science (CPHSS) released new tobacco control policy guidelines nationwide targeted at helping states and local communities reduce tobacco use.The focus is policy, not education, because that has been determined to have a broader effect, said Douglas Luke, the director of CPHSS and a professor at the Brown School of Social Work.Policy RecommendationsThe main recommendations of CPHSS tobacco control guidelines are to raise the price of tobacco products and to implement smoke-free policies.“Fewer people smoke, fewer people start smoking if the price is higher,” Luke said. While people who are addicted may still buy tobacco products even as the price goes up, a higher cost discourages new smokers from picking up the habit, he explained.That’s why Missouri’s low tobacco tax rate worries him.“We have the lowest tax rate on cigarettes in the entire country. And it just makes it easier for people to start because the cost of starting is much less compared to other places,” Luke said.Despite the low tax rate, Missouri has about the same percent of smokers as the national average, 19 percent. But St. Louis City has a higher concentration of smokers, sitting at 26 percent, Luke said.And Missouri is doing a bit better on the second half of the policy recommendations. While the state does not have a smoke-free policy, some local communities do.“As recent as the early 90s very few people in the United States lived in communities that had smoke-free policies, less than one percent. As of this year, about half the country lives in either in a state or a community that has strong smoke-free policies.” Luke said.E-CigarettesAnother focus of the policy guidelines is youth prevention, because most smokers begin smoking before the age of 18.The newest challenge on that front is the e-cigarette, said Luke, with many young people already switching over to the new non-tobacco version of the cigarette, which releases nicotine in vapor form.According to Luke, the concern about the e-cigarette is two-fold. First, they often aren’t subject to regulations. And second, they may prolong the use of nicotine even if the initial health risks are lower.Adding Years to a Child’s LifeThe thing about tobacco use, said Luke, is that not only is it the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, but it is a choice that has a direct impact on how long you live.If you can prevent a child from starting smoking, you can add 4 to 8 years to their life, he said.Related Information1-800-QUIT-NOWFree hotline in Missouri which connects callers with smoking cessation programs.St. Louis on the Air provides discussion about issues and concerns facing the St. Louis area.

670	"Blowing smoke?Electronic cigarettes are promoted as a healthier alternative to tobacco. Maybe yes, maybe no, but they are certainly not benign. They contain highly addictive nicotine, for one thing, and they should never be used by minors.Now it's reported that the so-called electronic hookah, a fancier, more colorful e-cigarette, is gaining in popularity with teens. Like e-cigarettes, e-hookahs emit vapor, not smoke, and come in a variety of flavors, including vanilla cupcake, banana nut and chocolate candy bar.Their manufacturers stoutly claim that the intent is not to market these devices to youngsters, and that they would be shocked — shocked! — if those under 18 were to use them. ...Five Democratic senators have introduced the Protecting Children from Electronic Cigarette Advertising Act. The legislation would let the Federal Trade Commission decide what constitutes aiming a company's marketing at children and then, with the help of individual states, enforce a ban.The problem, however, is just what ""marketing to children"" means. Past laws to ban such selling of tobacco cigarettes have been struck down by courts on the grounds that they would have unfairly prohibited a company's trying to sell to adult customers. ...Apart from disallowing ads that begin ""Hey, kids!,"" it has proved tough to come up with ways to restrict marketing that pass legal muster. ...Raising awareness ... may ultimately be more successful in reining in the popularity of e-devices than attempts to stifle their marketing.—Hartford Courant"	Health
671	Electronic cigarettes are now on par with tobacco smokes when it comes to their use in San Diego County.The county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to bring all electronic smoking and vapor devices under the same policies governing cigarette smoking cessation and reduction effortsThe move comes as several cities in the region and the San Diego County Fair Board have enacted or are considering new restrictions on electronic smoking devices in public settings.Supervisors Ron Roberts (who was absent because of a scheduling conflict) and Dave Roberts had requested a broadening of the county's policies toward smoking to include all the electronic devices that have emerged in recent years. The resolution was approved on a 3-1 vote with Supervisor Bill Horn cast the lone 'no' vote, citing electronic cigarettes as a tool for people to quit regular cigarettes.“It is a knee-jerk reaction to something that is taking place and I don’t think we should be telling adults you can’t use these if you are trying to get off nicotine,” Horn said.Dave Roberts rejected that, saying the unknowns of electronic smoking devices are too great to allow their unrestricted use and not target them as dangerous. He also argued electronic cigarettes are a gateway device to tobacco use.“The county should be a model and I cannot support a product that promotes addiction,” he said.In the spring, the county will consider another layer to electronic smoking device policy to prohibiting their use in any county facility.“Wherever conventional cigarettes are banned, this would be banned,” Dave Roberts said.Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer, said sales of e-cigarettes and similar items are mushrooming, tripling in recent years and leading to increased use among teens and young adults.County officials and numerous speakers who supported the supervisor's move also said electronic smoking devices are also being increasingly used to smoke marijuana and other illegal drugs.The San Diego County Fair Board banned conventional smoking on the fairgrounds last year, and is considering a regulation that would take the same action as county supervisors did today. The El Cajon City Council is also scheduled to consider an electronic cigarette policy when it meets today.	Health
672	"Evidence-based telephone or in-person smoking cessation services, along with proactive population-based tobacco cessation care are effective in increasing long-term population-level cessation rates, according to a new study in JAMA Internal Medicine. 5,123 current smokers ages 18–80 were randomized in the clinical trial (Veterans Victory Over Tobacco Study) to receive either usual care or proactive care (proactive outreach and choice of smoking cessation services via telephone or face-to-face). The proactive outreach also utilized mailed invitations, followed by telephone outreach. The smoking abstinence rate was 13.5% at one year for proactive care vs.10.9% for usual care (P=.02). A significant effect of the proactive care intervention on 6-month prolonged abstinence was seen as well.

It broke his cheek bones, top jaw, nose, skull and left him in the hospital for months. Afterward he wore a hat and glasses to disguise the asymmetry in his face, he told the BBC’s Hywel Griffith.Recently Power, 29, underwent a new round of surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea to restore his appearance. Maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar led the project in collaboration with the Centre of Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery and the National Centre for Product Design and Development Research.The unaffected side of Power’s head was scanned and used to produce a 3-D model. Then medical-grade plates and custom bone saw guides were 3D-printed. A surgical team had to re-fracture his cheek bones in order to rebuild his face. The procedure took eight hours. Powers told the BBC he could see the difference right after the surgery. ”It is totally life changing,” he said.Bionic Hand Restores Touch In Real TimeThe project is featured in an exhibition on 3-D printing at the Science Museum in London through July. Although surgical 3-D printing remains incredibly involved, the Wales team hopes it becomes more widely available over time.

Stephen Power, from Cardiff, is thought to be one of the first trauma patients in the world to have 3D printing used at every stage of the procedure. Doctors at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, had to break his cheekbones again before rebuilding his face.Mr Power said the operation had been ""life-changing"".The UK has become one of the world's pioneers in using 3D technology in surgery, with advances also being made by teams in London and Newcastle. While printed implants have previously been used to help correct congenital conditions, this operation used custom-printed models, guides, plates and implants to repair impact injuries months after they were sustained. Despite wearing a crash helmet Mr Power, 29, suffered multiple trauma injuries in the accident in 2012, which left him in hospital for four months. ""I broke both cheekbones, top jaw, my nose and fractured my skull,"" he said.""I can't remember the accident - I remember five minutes before and then waking up in the hospital a few months later."" In order to try to restore the symmetry of his face, the surgical team used CT scans to create and print a symmetrical 3D model of Mr Power's skull, followed by cutting guides and plates printed to match.Maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar says the 3D printing took away the guesswork that can be problematic in reconstructive work.""I think it's incomparable - the results are in a different league from anything we've done before,"" he said.""What this does is it allows us to be much more precise. Everybody now is starting to think in this way - guesswork is not good enough.""The procedure took eight hours to complete, with the team first having to refracture the cheekbones with the cutting guides before remodelling the face.A medical-grade titanium implant, printed in Belgium, was then used to hold the bones in their new shape. Looking at the results of the surgery, Mr Power says he feels transformed - with his face now much closer in shape to how it was before the accident. ""It is totally life-changing,"" he said.""I could see the difference straightaway the day I woke up from the surgery.""Having used a hat and glasses to mask his injuries before the operation, Mr Power has said he already feels more confident.""I'm hoping I won't have to disguise myself - I won't have to hide away,"" he said.""I'll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people, walk in the street, even go to any public areas.""The project was the work of the Centre for Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery (Cartis), which is a collaboration between the team in Swansea and scientists at Cardiff Metropolitan University.Design engineer Sean Peel has said the latest advance should encourage greater use of 3D printing in the NHS. ""It tends to be used for individual really complicated cases as it stands, in quite a convoluted, long-winded design process,"" he said.""The next victory will be to get this process and technique used more widely as the costs fall and as the design tools improve."" Mr Power's operation is currently being featured  in an exhibition at the Science Museum in London, called 3D Printing: The Future.

extensive facial injuries after a motorbike crash. Now thanks to pioneering use of 3D printing, surgeons were able to repair his face in a boundary-pushing reconstructive procedure that took months to plan and 

8 hours to complete.The crash, which occurred in September 2012, broke both Mr. Power's arms and his right leg, 

both cheek bones, both eye sockets, and his upper jaw. It also fractured his skull. He underwent emergency surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, some 36 miles from 

where the crash occurred in Llantwit Major. His limb injuries were so serious they required 

attention from a team of trauma, orthopedic and plastic surgeons. He needed a bone graft for 

his right leg.The surgeons did a good a job on his facial injuries, but they could not fully repair his left 

cheek and eye socket, as consultant maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar explains:""We fixed his facial fractures pretty well but he had damaged his left eye and the 

ophthalmologists did not want us to do anything that might damage his sight further.""As Mr. Power's eyesight has mostly recovered, this proved to be a good decision. But, Sugar adds, ""as a result we did not get his left cheekbone in the right place and we did not even 

try to reconstruct the very thin bones around his eye socket.""Mr. Power was consequently left with a distorted face - his left cheekbone was out of place 

and his left eye remained sunk in and lower than his right eye.So Mr. Sugar and a team got together to ""virtually plan"" the surgery to restore symmetry to 

Mr. Power's face.Using scanned 3D images of his face, they designed guides to cut and re-position the bones, 

and plates to hold them in place. All the models - including the guides and titanium implants - 

were made using 3D printing.""We did two types of model planning - virtual model planning on a computer screen and 

physical model planning,"" Mr. Sugar explains, ""Also we produced guides at each stage of the 

surgical process, not only to cut the bone but to reposition the bones, and then we had custom 

implants 3D printed.""He says that without the help of such advanced technology they would have to work freehand 

and ""guess"" where everything goes. ""The technology allows us to be far more precise and get a 

better result for the patient,"" he adds.Both surgeons and patient are pleased with the results of the operation. Mr. Power's 

cheekbone is in a better position, and the eye is not sunken any more, although it is slightly 

raised - but that might settle in the next few months, says Mr. Sugar.Before his pioneering surgery, Mr. Power had continued to wear glasses to disguise his cheek 

and eye, even though his vision had been improving. He said then that he was hoping the surgery 

would mean he would not have to hide his face and he would get his confidence back - he would be 

able to do everyday things, see people and go out in public.After the operation, Mr. Power said:""To be honest I thought they did a good job in the beginning anyway because of how bad my 

accident was. But from this operation I can't really explain how well it has gone. It has just 

made me look a lot better. I take my hat off to them.""He gave the operation a 9 out of 10. ""I'm glad he's not given us 

10,"" says Mr. Sugar, ""because if he did, we would not have any way of getting better.""Mr. Power is still not fully recovered from his overall physical injuries, but his facial 

reconstruction has been successful, and opens the door for the techniques to help others. Mr. 

Sugar says they did not take 3D technology just  one step further, but two, and perhaps even 

three steps further. He explains:""Previous efforts elsewhere to take it to this step have failed and so we have had to learn 

from those experiences. This is really the first time we've taken it to this stage, where 

everything to the very last screws being inserted has been planned and modelled in advance - and 

worked sweetly.""He says while it took months to plan it this time, next time it will take nowhere near as 

long.""We're talking maybe days as opposed to months. The ultimate aim is to undertake planning and 

be able to use custom-made guides and implants on a routine basis,"" he adds.He says the more experienced they become, the cheaper it will get, which will help to spread 

the expertise to ""any surgeon who finds themselves with this kind of problem.""The 3D reconstruction project was the work of the Centre for Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery, which is a 

partnership between Morriston Hospital's Maxillofacial Unit and the National Centre for Product 

Design and Development Research at Cardiff Metropolitan University.

The patient had sustained a shattered anterior orbital floor and rim due to blunt trauma. I grafted both with a single piece of bone from the patient's posterior lateral mandibular cortex.Looking Good.

683	 Former Cardiff barman Stephen Power became one of the first patients in the world to have 3D printing used throughout a reconstructive surgical procedure after he was severely injured in a motorbike accident.Breaking both his cheek bones, eye sockets, nose and upper jaw, Power could hardly be recognized after the crash in Llantwit Major, Wales, in September 2012. But surgeons at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, CT-scanned his face and produced all the necessary parts to rebuild his features, including the titanium implants, with a 3D printer.Mr. Power, who said that he was self-conscious about his appearance and used to disguise himself before the operation, said that the procedure was “totally life-changing.”Consultant maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar lauded the “incomparable” results. “Without this advanced technology, it’s all freehand — you just have to guess where everything goes,” he said.[Sky News, BBC]	Health

686	After 3D printing was used to help rebuild motorcyclist Stephen Power's face - we decided to look at other amazing medical advancesA survivor of a serious motorbike accident has had pioneering surgery to reconstruct his face using a series of 3D printed parts.Stephen Power from Cardiff is thought to be one of the first trauma patients in the world to have 3D printing used at every stage of the procedure.It’s the latest in series of medical miracles which have shown the ability of science to do the incredible. Bloodstream computerScientists have created a tiny, wirelessly powered, self-propelled medical device capable of controlled motion through the bloodstream.It could mean the era of swallow-the-surgeon medical care may no longer be the stuff of science fiction.Powered without wires or batteries, it can propel itself though the bloodstream and is small enough to fit through blood vessels.It is hoped the device will deliver drugs, perform analyses, and even zap blood clots or remove plaque from arteries in future. Brain-controller bionic leg Earlier amputated legs had to use sticks or wheel chairs for moving from one place to another, but then came the world’s first mind-controlled bionic leg.  Researched and launched by the Center for Bionic Medicine at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the leg is designed with a robotic feature that operates based on feedback from the brain of the person connected to it. The leg makes possible for people who have problems with knee-amputations, full leg amputation.With the use of this bionic leg patients walk, climb stairs and move the leg when seated. X-ray specs The Eyes-On Glasses System makes it makes even hard-to-locate veins easy to find for nurses and doctors for attaching drips.The glasses work by using the multi-spectral lighting to see veins beneath the skin and two digital cameras that transmit images wirelessly using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or 3G connectivity.On-board data storage allows documentation of a procedure, including videos and photos.The telemedicine capability allows images to be shared remotely and can even connect to hospital electronic medical records systems for automated documentation. Robotic drummer Scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology have created a robotic drumming prosthesis with motors that power two drumsticks. The first stick is controlled both physically by the musicians’ arms and electronically using electromyography (EMG) muscle sensors. The other stick “listens” to the music being played and improvises.The prosthesis was created for Jason Barnes, a drummer who was electrocuted two years ago and lost his right arm below the elbow Face transplant In 1994 nine year old Sandeep Kaur from India had her face and scalp completely amputated from a threshing machine.The machine caught one of Sandeep’s braids causing her head to be pulled in. Abraham Thomas, one of India’s top microsurgeons managed to reattach Sandeep’s face back onto her skull and reconnect the arteries.Sandeep is now a nurse. Tiny robotIt sounds like something from the film Innerspace but it’s reality. The tiny robotic surgical tool is operated by surgeons using a video screen and allows a non-invasive way of removing appendixes as well as more complex operations.The Insertable Robotic Effector Platform (IREP) can enter the body through a single 15 millimeter incision, unfold from its capsule and, following a surgeon’s instructions, move toward a particular organ to execute surgical tasks, such as clamping arteries and tying sutures. NanoKnifeThe device sends electrical pulses into prostate cancer cells causing them to collapse and die. The NanoKnife uses electricity to open up holes in cells through a process called electroporation.This process is used in research laboratories so that researchers can put foreign DNA into cells and bacteria, but the process quickly reverses itself and the holes close up.The NanoKnife causes irreversible electroporation, and after a few bursts of electricity, essentially turns the cell membrane of cancer cells to mush causing ions to enter the cells and results in cell death. Bionic eye helps blind The new bionic eye works by converting video images captured by a miniature camera, housed in the patient’s glasses, into a series of small electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes on the surface of the retina.These pulses are intended to stimulate the retina’s remaining cells resulting in the corresponding perception of patterns of light in the brain.Patients then learn to interpret these visual patterns thereby regaining some visual function.It’s not sight as we know it but when you have nothing but darkness it must be incredible. Rewalk A commercial bionic walking assistance system, using powered leg attachments which enables paraplegics to stand upright, walk, and climb stairs.The system is powered by a backpack battery, and is controlled by a simple wrist-mounted remote which detects and enhances the user’s movementsIn May 2012 British woman Claire Lomas used a ReWalk to become the first person ever to finish a marathon using a bionic assistance suit.Lomas, who was paralyzed from the waist down in a 2007 riding accident, completed the London Marathon in 17 days with her ReWalk system. Computer brain European researchers have developed “neuro-chips” in which living brain cells and silicon circuits are coupled together.The achievement could one day enable the creation of sophisticated neural prostheses to treat neurological disorders.To create the neuro-chip, researchers squeezed more than 16,000 electronic transistors and hundreds of capacitors onto a silicon chip just 1mm square in size.

  Stephen Power of Cardiff, Wales was hospitalized for four months
  after he endured multiple injuries in a 2012 accident. He was
  wearing a helmet at the time of the crash but still suffered
  gruesome injuries.

  “I broke both cheek bones, top jaw, my nose and fractured my
  skull,” Power, 29, told Hywel
  Griffith of the BBC. “I can’t remember the accident – I
  remember five minutes before and then waking up in the hospital a
  few months later.”

  Surgeons at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales used CT scans to
  recreate Power’s face and then print a symmetrical 3D model of
  his cranium. They then cut that mould down with cutting guides
  and printed plates to restructure his face.

  The procedure lasted eight hours, culminating with medical-grade
  titanium implants set into his face to ensure that the bones
  remain in place.

  Power said that before the surgery he would hide his face with
  help from a hat and glasses. That is no longer necessary, thanks
  to the surgeons and their willingness to try what could become a
  more common method of operation.

  “It’s totally life changing,” Power said. “I could
  see the difference straight away the day I woke up from the
  surgery…I’ll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people,
  walk in the street, even go to any public areas.”

  Maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar said in a statement that the
  results were unlike anything he’s encountered before.

  “Without this advanced technology, it’s freehand. You have to
  guess where everything goes,” he said, as quoted by the
  AFP’s Guy Jackson. “The technology allows us to be far more
  precise and get a better result for the patient.”

  The process of 3D printing includes manually entering geometric
  data into a computer and forming it into graphics, a process that
  has been compared to digital sculpting. The computer then scans
  the “sculpture” and forms a physical, three dimensional model of
  the desired piece.

  Printers have already been used to design new technology that
  could be used in zero or low gravity situations in outer space.
  Last year, a US-based group made international headlines after
  announcing it planned to “[design a working plastic gun that
  could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D
  printer,” as quoted by Forbes’ Andy Greenberg.

  The idea of 3D printers helping potentially dangerous people
  build their own high-powered killing machines was unsettling,
  although the possibility that 3D printers could be used to
  benefit someone who had suffered a serious injury did not seem to
  be considered at the time.

  Stephen Power appears to be the first person to have undergone
  such an extensive surgery with help from a 3D printer. Yet dozens
  of patients in the UK last year did experience similar surgeries
  to aid with various maladies they were experiencing.

  Ann O’Sullivan, a grandmother who lives in Roehampton, in
  south-western London, thought she had a sinus problem only to go
  to the doctor and be informed that she was in fact experiencing
  the rapid growth of a tumor just beneath the skin on her face.

  “I’ve always been healthy so it came as a shock when the
  doctor referred me to the hospital where the scan revealed a
  tumor. The hardest thing to take was the loss of my left
  eye,” she told Emma Innes of the Daily Mail last year.
  “The surgeons told me it was just rotten luck but that I was
  lucky the tumor had been growing outwards rather than
  inwards.”

  O’Sullivan underwent a 10-hour operation that involved surgeons
  taking bone fragments from her leg in order to reconstruct part
  of her jaw. The 3D technology also helped doctors reconnect a
  number of veins, arteries, and tissue grafts.

  “I put my faith in the hospital and they saved my life,”
  she said. “I told myself it could have been worse and am now
  focused on getting on with my life. You have to be
  positive.”

692	"THE TIMESStephen Power suffered severe injuries to his head and face in a motorcycle crash in 2012 and was in hospital for four months.""I can&apos;t remember the accident — I remember five minutes before and then waking up in the hospital a few months later. I broke both cheekbones, top jaw, my nose and fractured my skull,"" he said.Mr Power, who was wearing a crash helmet, had also injured his left eye and, anxious not to cause further damage to his vision, his doctors chose not to reposition his left cheekbone or the bones around the eye socket. As a result, his face remained disfigured, with the left eye positioned too low and left cheek more prominent than the right one.Doctors at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales, have now broken his cheekbone in three places and rebuilt the left side of his face using 3-D printed titanium plates.Adrian Sugar, a consultant maxillofacial surgeon who led the follow-up surgery, said: ""Stephen was wearing a hat and glasses to disguise his appearance and was avoiding leaving the house. His left eye was in the wrong position and his cheek looked strange. People do not realise just how disruptive these injuries can be.""Working with designers and engineers at Cardiff Metropolitan University, the surgical team planned his facial reconstruction in intricate detail — removing much of the guesswork that is normally left to surgeons on the day.They came up with a strategy for restoring symmetry to Mr Power&apos;s face, using CT scans and software similar to that used by structural engineers and architects in building design.The plan involved sawing his left cheekbone into three fragments that would be repositioned to mirror the right side of his face.During the eight-hour procedure, Mr Sugar used a 3-D printed template to guide his incisions, allowing him to translate precisely from the computer simulation to the patient&apos;s flesh and bone.Sean Peel, a research engineer who is based at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said: ""This was entirely planned digitally and then translated to the surgery. This was definitely a first for us.""Mr Sugar said that the detailed planning was ""incomparable"" to any previous operation, but predicted that using computer software and personalised prosthetics would be normal in the future.""Architects wouldn&apos;t dream of constructing a complex building without planning it in detail first,"" he said. ""If you don&apos;t do that you&apos;re going to end up with a bit of a mess.""Mr Power said that the results of the operation were ""totally life-changing"". ""I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up,"" he said. ""I can&apos;t really explain how well it has gone.

A law passed in 2012 set a deadline of the end of this year for the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles to decidehow to legally integrate the so-called autonomous vehicles — which were once the stuff of science fiction but could be commercially available by the end of the decade. 
The latest talks on the matter among roads officials focused on how the vehicles will record actions so the data can be used to reconstruct an accident in an effort to apportion blame.

USA:
Wildlife officials are planning to move hatchery-raised salmon across California by tanker trucks next month if water levels in the Sacramento River and its tributaries prove too low and inhospitable for the fish. 
Officials fear the rivers could become too shallow and warm to sustain migrating salmon, and will keep an eye on conditions while crossing their fingers for heavy rain.

Surgeons said that by using 3D printing techniques, much of the guesswork was removed from the reconstruction of the face - which is remarkably similar, AFP reports, to what it was before the accident.The team at Morriston Hospital in Wales used CT scans to create and print a symmetrical 3D model of Mr Power's skull, followed by cutting guides and plates printed to match. His cheekbones were rebroken, following the cutting guides, before the remodelling of the face was completed, and a titanium implant printed in Belgium was then used to hold the bones in place.Mr Power, who wore a hat and glasses to hide his injuries before the operation, says the results are ""totally life-changing"".""I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up,"" he told the BBC.

London - A British man who suffered horrific facial injuries in a motorbike accident has had pioneering surgery to rebuild his face using 3D printed parts.Stephen Power from Cardiff in Wales is thought to be one of the first trauma patients in the world to have a procedure in which 3D printing was used at every stage.The 29-year-old suffered multiple trauma injuries in an accident in 2012.

The team at Morriston Hospital in Wales' second city, Swansea, used CT scans to create and print a symmetrical 3D model of his skull, followed by cutting guides and plates printed to match.In order to try to restore the symmetry of his face, the surgical team used CT scans to create and print a symmetrical model of Power's scan.It then cut guides and printed plates to match the CT scan.The surgical team had to re-fracture Power's cheekbones, following the cutting guides, before remodelling the face.A titanium implant, printed in Belgium, was then used to hold the bones in place.Power said the results were ""totally life changing"".He wore a hat and glasses to hide his injuries before the operation, but said he felt transformed immediately after the surgery.""I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up,"" Power told the BBC.""I'm hoping I won't have to disguise myself -- I won't have to hide away.""I'll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people, walk in the street, even go to any public areas.""Maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar said the results were ""incomparable"" with anything he had achieved before.""Without this advanced technology, it's freehand.

When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the platform's algorithm would soon shift to prioritize posts from family and friends, brands and publishers went into panic mode. With good reason, because this latest update is going to change Facebook monetization strategy a lot. But it won't be the final nail in the coffin for publishers.
	The dust is finally settling after Facebook's latest News Feed restructuring announcement. The initial shock has waned, and brands are now figuring out how to approach the unavoidable shift. And while it (still) may seem like the death of organic reach to many, there's more opportunity to be had than ever before.

	Facebook has always had a leg up on other platforms. While users on most social platforms are typically passive in nature, Facebook's users have always been active contributors — whether it be by posting baby pictures, making a personal announcement, changing a relationship status, etc. But over time, the social giant started seeing a trend toward more passive, lazy content consumption. Video only exacerbated this laziness as users began scrolling through content without purpose, and certainly avoiding anything with a three-second pre-roll ad.
At RebelMouse, we're experts at our craft. We make it our mission to stay up to date with all of the latest happenings in the digital sphere, and the work we do reflects this. We're constantly adding customized offerings to our services portfolio to ensure our technology is adapted to seamlessly propel you into the future of media.RebelMouse offers a variety of dynamic services that require custom integrations.

Fill out the form below and a Rebel will contact you within one business day.Your social feed is most likely filled with frenzy-generating headlines highlighting Facebook's latest News Feed update. That's because it's a big one, and it's forcing brands and publishers to alter their social strategies and figure out how to better approach the mega platform early on in 2018.At RebelMouse we're obsessed with perfecting every detail of our product. We're constantly iterating and making it easier for our clients to focus on creating great and dynamic content, instead of worrying about tech. Our Particle Assembler breaks down articles into micro pieces of content — or what we like to call particles — that are easily shared on social.
How do publishers battle the platforms? How do they leverage the duopoly to secure revenue and build audiences in 2018?

	Organic loyalty isn't a new concept, but it's now more relevant than ever. Publishers who adopted a pay-to-play strategy in 2017 can no longer survive. To make it in media, you must create and nurture deep, meaningful relationships to foster the type of organic growth that brings in real revenue.

705	STAGGERING TRANSFORMATION... Stephen Power before and after having facial reconstruction surgery following a motorcycle accident. — AFP A British man who suffered horrific facial injuries in a motorbike accident has had pioneering surgery to rebuild his face using 3D printed parts.Stephen Power from Cardiff in Wales is thought to be one of the first trauma patients in the world to have a procedure in which 3D printing was used at every stage.The 29-year-old suffered multiple trauma injuries in an accident in 2012. Despite wearing a crash helmet, his top jaw, nose and both cheek bones were broken and he fractured his skull.Surgeons said that by using 3D printing techniques, much of the guesswork was removed from the reconstruction of the face. The result is a face that is remarkably similar to Power’s before the accident.The team at Morriston Hospital in Wales’ second city, Swansea, used CT scans to create and print a symmetrical 3D model of his skull, followed by cutting guides and plates printed to match.A combination of undated handout images shows 3D models of the face of Stephen Power used in the development and planning of his facial reconstruction surgery. It shows guides for cutting and positioning and plates to hold the bones in place in plastic (top) and medical-grade titanium (bottom) all created using 3D printers. — AFP In order to try to restore the symmetry of his face, the surgical team used CT scans to create and print a symmetrical model of Power’s scan. It then cut guides and printed plates to match the CT scan. The surgical team had to re-fracture Power’s cheekbones, following the cutting guides, before remodelling the face.A titanium implant, printed in Belgium, was then used to hold the bones in place. Power said the results were “totally life changing”.He wore a hat and glasses to hide his injuries before the operation, but said he felt transformed immediately after the surgery. “I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up,” Power told the BBC.“I’m hoping I won’t have to disguise myself — I won’t have to hide away.“I’ll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people, walk in the street, even go to any public areas.”Maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar said the results were “incomparable” with anything he had achieved before.“Without this advanced technology, it’s freehand. You have to guess where everything goes,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.“The technology allows us to be far more precise and get a better result for the patient.”The project was a joint venture between the Centre of Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery (Cartis), a collaboration between the Swansea hospital and scientists at Cardiff Metropolitan University.It is being featured in an exhibition about 3D printing at the Science Museum in London.Other portable electronic devices could be used in flight mode.

706	"Before and after pictures showing how a 3D printer has been used to rebuild a man's face have been released by scientists in Wales.Stephen Power, a 29-year-old father of one, suffered from extensive injuries after he crashed his motorbike in September 2012.He broke both arms and ne needed a bone graft on his right leg. Both his cheek bones, eye sockets and upper jaw also broke and his skull fractured.Surgeons treating Power at Morriston Hospital were able to repair most of his facial injuries, other than his left cheek and eye.""We fixed his facial fractures pretty well but he had damaged his left eye and the ophthalmologists did not want us to do anything that might damage his sight further. Consultant maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar said.""That was a good move because his eyesight has mostly recovered. But as a result we did not get his left cheekbone in the right place and we did not even try to reconstruct the very thin bones around his eye socket.""So the result was that his cheekbone was too far out and his eye was sunk in and dropped.""Researchers at the Centre for Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery working in partnership with Morriston Hospital and Cardiff Metropolitan University then went about planning surgery to reconstruct Power's face.The team used scanned images of his face to cut and position the bones. All models, including the implants, were created using a 3D printer.""Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments,"" Sugar said. ""Being able to do that and to put them back in the right position was a complex three dimensional exercise. It made sense to plan it in three dimensions and that is why 3D printing came in – and successive 3D printing, as at every different stage we had a model.""Stephen's eye is now a little bit raised, but that might settle over the next few months. Apart from that, his cheekbone is in a good position and the prominence of the eye is much better.""He has given us nine out of 10 – a good assessment and one I agree with. I'm glad he's not given us 10 because if he did, we would not have any way of getting better.""After the operation, Power said: ""To be honest I thought they did a good job in the beginning anyway because of how bad my accident was. But from this operation I can't really explain how well it has gone. It has just made me look a lot better. I take my hat off to them."""	Health

London: In a medical first, a survivor of a serious road accident in the UK has undergone pioneering surgery to reconstruct his face using 3D printed parts.In an eight-hour surgery, doctors at Morriston Hospital in Wales repaired 29-year-old Stephen Power`s cheekbone and eye socket using the cutting-edge technology.Doctors had to break his cheekbones again before rebuilding his face.While printed implants have previously been used to help correct congenital conditions, this operation used custom printed models, guides, plates and implants to repair impact injuries months after they were sustained.
Despite wearing a crash helmet Power suffered multiple trauma injuries in an accident in 2012, which left him in hospital for four months.""I broke both cheek bones, top jaw, my nose and fractured my skull,"" the BBC quoted Power as saying.In order to try and restore the symmetry of his face, the surgical team used CT scans to create and print a symmetrical 3D model of Power`s skull, followed by cutting guides and plates printed to match.Maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar says the 3D printing took away the guesswork that can be problematic in reconstructive work.
""I think it`s incomparable - the results are in a different league from anything we`ve done before,"" he said.A medical-grade titanium implant, printed in Belgium, was then used to hold the bones in their new shape.Looking at the results of the surgery, Power says he feels transformed - with his face now much closer in shape to how it was before the accident.""It is totally life changing,"" he said.""I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up from the surgery.""""It tends to be used for individual really complicated cases as it stands - in quite a convoluted, long-winded design process,"" design engineer Sean Peel said.""The next victory will be to get this process and technique used more widely as the costs fall and as the design tools improve.""Doctors said the surgery is thought to be one of the first trauma patients in the world to have 3D printing used at every stage of the procedure.
Power`s operation is currently being featured in an exhibition at the Science Museum in London."	Health

710	"Despite wearing a helmet, Cardiff biker Stephen Power managed to break his cheek bones, upper jaw, nose and fracture his skull in an accident in 2012, one that required a four-month hospital stay as part of his recovery. Now, to patch his face up, doctors are inserting 3D printed parts.CT scans were used to create a symmetrical 3D model of how his complete face looked before it was smashed out of shape, with the required replacements for broken bits of bone printed out and held into place with a printed titanium implant. The result of the op, which required his cheekbones to be re-broken by surgeons as part of the repair job, is ""totally life changing.""The extremely graphic BBC report shows how Power's face was effectively peeled away from his skull, with a surgeon screwing the 3D parts onto the surviving parts of his facial bones with a rather large screwdriver.

711	A British man has had pioneering surgery to reconstruct his face using 3D printed parts.Doctors at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales, operated on Stephen Power, who survived a serious motorbike accident in 2012 with a partially shattered face. The surgical team used scans of Power’s skull to design custom printed models, guides and titanium implants to hold his bones in place.The procedure, which took place in February, took months of planning and involved eight hours of surgery. It’s thought to be the first time 3D printing has been used at every stage of the procedure on a trauma patient, says the BBC.“What this does it allows us to be much more precise. Everybody now is starting to think in this way—guesswork is not good enough,” said surgeon Adrian Sugar, noting that 3D printing removed the usual problem of guesswork in reconstructive surgery.“It is totally life changing,” said Power. “I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up from the surgery.”[BBC]	Health

713	"Surgeons in Wales have used parts created on a 3-D printer to rebuild the face of a man seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. Using a series of printed models, guides, plates and implants, the surgical team was able to create a symmetrical 3-D model of the his face and skull.3-D printed parts have been used at every stage of reconstructive surgery. Although he was wearing a crash helmet at the time of the accident, the patient, named Stephen Power, broke both cheekbones, his top jaw and his nose and he fractured his skull.  The operation took eight hours and the surgeons needed to rebreak his cheekbones to rebuild his face. A medical-grade titanium implant was used to hold the bones in their new shape.The surgeons said the 3-D printer allowed them to be much more precise in doing the reconstruction.NEXT: Flu Pandemic begins: March 11, 1918Sourced from: BBC, Pioneering 3D printing reshapes patient’s face in WalesSeveral small-scale studies performed by scientists from the UK and Korea found that patients were less likely to have issues with food and body image after being administered a dose of oxytocin, the hormone released naturally during any form of bonding, including sex, childbirth and breastfeeding.In the first of the most recent studies, published in Psychoneuroendocrinology, 31 patients with anorexia and 33 people who did not have the condition were given either a dose of oxytocin, delivered via nasal spray, or a placebo treatment. The study participants then looked at a series of images showing a range of high and low calorie foods and people of different body shapes and weight. After taking oxytocin, according to the researchers, patients with anorexia were less likely to focus on the “negative” images of food and fat body parts.Another study involving the same group of people looked at their reactions to facial expressions depicting anger, disgust or happiness, since it has been suggested that anorexia can be linked to a heightened perception of threat, and that oxytocin could inhibit that perception. The results showed that patients with anorexia were less likely to focus on the “disgust” faces after the oxytocin treatment and they were less likely to avoid looking at the angry faces.Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments for anorexia.NEXT: Gut bacteria essential for developing immune cellsSourced from: BBC, ‘Love hormone’ may treat anorexia

          12View  commentsA father has made surgical  history by having his face reconstructed by 3D printers.Stephen Power suffered terrible  injuries in a motorbike accident 18 months ago, fracturing his skull and breaking both cheek bones, his jaw, eye socket and nose.After early operations the 29-year-old still had a lopsided face and collapsed cheek – and feared he would never have the confidence to appear in public again.Before: Stephen Power sustained fractured cheek bones and eye sockets, while his upper jaw and skull were smashed after a motorbike accident After: He has now made surgical history after having his skull reconstructed by groundbreaking 3D technology in a world-first operation   However surgeons were too worried to carry out any further procedures in case his eyesight was damaged.Now revolutions in surgical technology have allowed them to reconstruct Mr Power’s face with 3D-printed titanium implants – thought to be the first operation of its kind anywhere in the world.Despite wearing a crash helmet, Mr Power, from Cardiff, spent four months in hospital after the accident.After preliminary operations, doctors at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, decided they had to break his cheekbones again before rebuilding his face.Painstaking: The facial models, guides and implants which were all 3D printed by the team at Swansea's Morriston Hospital Design engineers at Cardiff Metropolitan University used CT scans to create and print a 3D plastic model of Mr Power’s skull and the section of his cheek to be repaired.A series of 3D-printed cutting guides allowed the surgeons to accurately cut and reposition broken bones. In the final stage of the eight-hour operation, two printed titanium implants were slotted into Mr Power’s broken eye socket and cheek, and the cutting guides were removed.Pioneering: Mr Power's skull after the operation with temporary staples His surgeon said: 'Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments' Dr Dominic Eggbeer, head of  surgical design at the university’s National Centre for Product Design and Development Research, said: ‘It was like solving a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces of bone had been  displaced in the accident and had reset in the wrong place. The aim was to cut them apart and then pull them back into place.’ Surgeon Adrian Sugar says the 3D printing made the reconstruction far more accurate than previous methods.‘The results are in a different league from anything we’ve done before,’ he said.‘Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments. It made sense to plan it in three dimensions and that is why 3D printing came in, and successive 3D printing, because at every different stage we had a model.’Mr Power's surgeon said he was pleased with the results of the operation, adding: 'Stephen's eye is now a little bit raised, but that might settle over the next few months' Mr Power, who worked in a bar before his accident, said his face is now almost back to normal.‘It is totally life changing,’ he said. ‘I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up from the surgery.’ Mr Power, who used a hat and glasses to mask his injuries before the operation, added: ‘I’m hoping I won’t have to disguise myself. I’ll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people, walk in the street.‘It has just made me look a lot  better.

Both cheek bones, both eye sockets and his upper jaw were broken and he had a fractured skull.Stephen underwent emergency surgery at Morriston Hospital. His limb injuries were very serious and were managed by the trauma and orthopaedic surgeons and the plastic surgeons.To be honest I thought they did a good job in the beginning anyway because of how bad my accident was.But from this operation I can't really explain how well it has gone. It has just made me look a lot better. I take my hat off to them.More: Welsh artists embrace 3D printing in CardiffMore: Seven uses for a 3D printerThe team used scanned 3D images of Stephen’s face to design guides to cut and position the bones, as well as plates to hold the bones in place.

Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 1:56 pmGROTON, Conn. - March has been officially National Colon Cancer Awareness Month since the year 2000. The symbol is a blue star to symbolize the eternal memory of those who have lost their lives to colon cancer. It is also a symbol of hope for a future free of colon cancer.Katie Couric brought national attention to this fight by discussing her husband’s death from colorectal cancer. She even had her own colonoscopy taped and watched by millions of viewers on TV, all in an effort to make known more about this and the preventative screenings available that save lives.The CDC report in 2010 stated that 131,607 people in the United States were diagnosed with colon cancer or 1 in 20 people. The risk of developing colon cancer increases with age, usually occurring in people over 50 years old. This does not mean younger people never get it. Risk factors include: a family history of colon cancer, colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease and a genetic syndrome called (FAP), familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome).The CDC studies suggest that at least 6 out of 10 deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented if all people aged 50 years or older were screened routinely. Discuss your screening plan with your healthcare provider.Other things that studies show may decrease the risk of developing colon cancer are: Exercising regularly, eating lots of fruits and vegetables (low fat, high fiber diet), limiting alcohol intake, and not using tobacco.Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

725	"Welcome! News Feed ItemLONDON and VIENNA, March 13, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --Annual incidence of Europe's second most lethal cancer killer is predicted to rise by 12% by 2020[1] warns Europe's largest body of gastroenterology experts, United European Gastroenterology (UEG). Colorectal cancer is estimated to claim the lives of 214,675[2] adults in Europe and is expected to affect 502,000 Europeans a year by 2020[1].Colorectal cancer is extremely lethal in its advanced stages yet early detection can result in a 90-95% survival rate. Early signs of colorectal cancer do not exist or are difficult to spot but can be detected via a simple screening test (the Faecal Occult Blood Test) that can be performed at home. Widely available across Europe, the FOBT is generally offered to men and women over the age of 50 via an invitation from their doctor or a national screening programme. However, uptake throughout Europe has been surprisingly low, with the percentage of eligible adults screened in many countries falling way short of the 65% rate considered desirable by the European Commission and already achieved in the USA[3].While Europe's promotion of organised national screening programmes is seen as preferable to America's 'opportunistic' approach, UEG experts say Europe can learn from the USA when it to comes to pushing CRC to the forefront of public life. Annual campaigns fronted by Meryl Streep and other Hollywood stars, nationwide 'Dress in Blue Days' and a White House colorectal cancer statement issued by President Obama earlier this month are all helping to raise the profile of the disease and the importance of screening across the Atlantic.""United European Gastroenterology has campaigned for screening for colorectal cancer to be available to all European citizens; we are now urging the European population to participate and to be aware that FOBT screening reduces the risk of dying from colorectal cancer by 20-30%. Colorectal cancer is treatable when detected early, yet it is estimated to claim the lives of over 500 Europeans every day,"" says British gastroenterologist and UEG President, Professor Michael Farthing.As the world marks Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month (March) UEG is launching a new awareness campaign, 'Screening Saves Lives', urging all European men and women over 50 to talk to a healthcare professional and undertake screening for colorectal cancer.#screeningsaveslivesDownload a map of CRC Incidence & Mortality in Europe here http://www.ueg.eu/crcmap/ and an infographic about CRC screening here http://www.ueg.eu/crceurope/Notes to Editors

BAYTOWN- (March 1, 2014) – One in 20 people will be diagnosed with colon cancer. It’s a scary statistic and it’s one of the reasons why Houston Methodist San Jacinto Hospital will be hosting companywide events where employees hope to incite awareness of colon cancer, a disease that can be prevented through screening, but remains the second leading cause of overall cancer deaths in the United States. Awareness events will take place throughout the month of March at the hospital.  Dress in blue day at Houston Methodist San Jacinto will be on March 7th in conjunction with the Colon Cancer Alliance’s National Dress in Blue Day program. One activity commemorating March as Colon Cancer Awareness Month will be a colon cancer educational seminar on March 4th from 6:30-7:30pm at the hospital’s Cancer Center where free colon cancer screening kits will be given out to all participants (This event is also open to the public! Call 713.790.3333 to register). Employees will be able to buy blue ribbons in support of colon cancer awareness or in memory of loved ones throughout the month of March. The ribbons will be displayed in the hospital’s cafeteria throughout the month. March 21st will be the Blue your Unit Competition! Medical units and departments throughout the hospital will decorate their units blue in order to raise awareness for colon cancer. There will be a judging contest and the winning unit will receive a free pizza party!“We wanted to make a difference in the lives of our employees, their families and their friends. Our Dress in Blue Day event encourages employees to talk to loved ones about colon cancer and the importance of being screened. By creating more awareness around this disease, we will save lives,” said Donna Gares, CEO. “It’s important that we do our part by helping the Colon Cancer Alliance create a future free of colon cancer.”

733	"March Is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month One of the deadliest cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States - depending upon where it starts, it can be referred to as colon cancer or rectal cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be almost 97,000 new cases of colon cancer and 40,000 new cases of rectal cancer in the U.S. this year alone. That's just one reason why March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month and ASAP Urgent Care is talking about prevention and helping people find out whether they're at risk. ""Those over 50 years of age have the greatest risk of developing colorectal cancer,"" says Lawrence Earl, MD, medical director of ASAP Urgent Care. ""Others at risk for the disease are those with a history of polyps, inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's), and those with a family history of colorectal polyps or cancer."" Throughout the month of March, ASAP Urgent Care is offering colorectal cancer risk assessments and fecal occult blood tests for $25. If necessary, ASAP can also make appropriate referrals for colonoscopies. According to the American Cancer Society, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about one in 20, or five percent. The risk is only slightly lower in women. Fortunately, the colorectal cancer death rate has been decreasing for 20 years. This is a result of screening for polyps that can be removed before they turn into cancer. Today, more than one million people are considered colorectal cancer survivors. Even so, it is expected that more than 50,000 people will die from colorectal cancer in the U.S. in 2014. About ASAP Urgent Care Founded in Connecticut by doctors with over three decades of experience, ASAP Urgent Care is dedicated to providing a better solution for people who have urgent medical needs. In addition, ASAP offers occupational medicine, online doctor visits, and diet and sleep aid for patients of all ages. ASAP Urgent Care also has employer services to help keep businesses running and employees healthy with a wide range of services from diagnostics, to flu clinics, to drug screenings, and more. Centers are open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., except on Thanksgiving and Christmas. ASAP guarantees patients will be seen within 20 minutes of checking in at its locations - if ASAP is somehow unable to fulfill this promise, patients made to wait more than 20 minutes will receive a credit of $20 toward their next visit. Through ASAP's website, patients can check in online as well as can video conference with healthcare professionals from the comfort of their own homes. ASAP Urgent Care centers are open in Hamden - 203-248-2727 and Madison - 203-318-8000. The chain will open facilities in Milford and North Haven in early 2014.

The event will take place at Lenoir-Rhyne University, 625 7th Ave., NE, at 9 a.m.New this year is a Kids’ Fun Run at 8:30 a.m.Runners, walkers, volunteers and spectators will gather to raise awareness of the nation’s No. 3 cancer killer, and raise funds for colon cancer prevention screening. The day will include opportunities to honor colon cancer survivors and support care givers.Gastroenterology Associates, P.A., Piedmont Pathology Associates Inc. and Porsche of Hickory are the local Presenting Sponsors.Get Your Rear in Gear – Hickory is produced by the Colon Cancer Coalition, a nonprofit organization based in Minneapolis, and is part of the nation’s largest series of run/walk events dedicated to colon cancer education and screening.“March is National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, so the timing of our event is perfect,” said Dr. Gregory Diamonti of Gastroenterology Associates and local event chair.“Our first event last year was a great success. We had more than 550 participants and raised $22,000. These funds were awarded in grants from the Colon Cancer Coalition to Catawba Valley Medical Center and Frye Regional Medical Center colon cancer support funds.”Funds raised at Get Your Rear in Gear - Hickory stay in the community to be invested in local projects to increase colon cancer awareness and education, screening and prevention programs, and offer support services to those affected by the disease.Survivor’s StoryCarla Davis of Hickory, a 10-year colon cancer survivor, said she firmly believes that early detection of colon cancer saves lives. She is serving as a team captain for Get Your Rear in Gear – Hickory 5K Run/Walk again this year. Following the 2013 event, Davis said, “I worked hard at just walking this walk. The last hill I climbed was most symbolic because as I topped the hill and turned to the finish line (in last place), I heard the crowd chanting my name and saw people waving to me and clapping for me. It was almost as if they were not only cheering for me to finish the race but they were cheering for what I had already won. I plan to work hard for this cause and applaud anyone who becomes involved in it.”Colon cancer is the No. 3 cause of cancer death in the United States. More than 80 percent of colorectal cancers can be prevented through regular screening. Even people who lead a healthy lifestyle can still develop polyps and cancer. Age is the single most important risk factor for the disease. Colorectal cancer screening should be a part of routine health maintenance for people 50 years of age and over.Event details and registration information is available at www.getyourrearingear.com/Hickory .

SALT LAKE CITY - A national awareness campaign under way in March is urging people in Utah and elsewhere to be screened for what can be one of the deadliest forms of cancer.""Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month"" is important, said Shane Ferraro, media relations manager at the American Cancer Society of Utah, because early detection and treatment can greatly increase the chances of surviving these types of cancer.""Colorectal cancer is only a handful of cancers which screening has proven to save lives,"" he said, ""both by finding and removing polyps before they turn cancerous, and by finding cancers early when treatment is most likely to be successful.""An estimated 250 Utahns will die from colorectal cancer this year, Ferraro said. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it's the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans. Screening should start at age 50, Ferraro said, adding that having a colonoscopy every 10 years is the ""gold standard"" of screening methods. A less invasive procedure called the Fecal Immunochemical Test, or ""FIT"" test, can be done at home, he said.""There are a number of other tests that you can get that are a little bit less invasive, such as the FIT test,"" he said. ""So, what we recommend is the best test that you get is the one that you actually get.""Health professionals say it's also important to be screened if there is a family history of the disease. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 50,000 Americans will die from colorectal cancer this year.CDC information about colorectal cancer is online at cdc.gov.

This cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Screening is an important step in diagnosing and treating cancer. But many people don’t get screened regularly, especially for colorectal cancer. Transportation, money and time are all barriers to screening.Norman Regional wants to remove those barriers by offering a free, at-home screening kit. All people need to do is follow the instructions included in the kit to send in their sample. NRH will test the sample and inform individuals of their test results.The Walgreens pharmacies in Norman and Moore and the Physicians and Surgeons Pharmacy in Norman have partnered with NRHS to distribute the kits to the community. These kits are available while supplies last. It is important the tests are completed and submitted within two weeks of receiving the kit.Within three to four weeks of returning their kit, participants will receive a letter with their results. If they provide the name and address of their physician, Norman Regional can mail him or her a copy of the results as well.Participants are strongly encouraged to discuss the findings of this test with their physician, regardless of the results.Colorectal cancer risk factors include: being over the age of 50, a personal history of colorectal polyps, a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, and having Type 2 diabetes.In addition, the Health System provides community resources such as free cancer screenings like this one, and support groups for those battling cancer.

Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 12:15 pmMarch is colorectal cancer awareness month, and Uncompahgre Medical Center is honoring that with a limited number of free colorectal screenings. A national movement, UMC is on board creating awareness that colorectal cancer is preventable, treatable and beatable.According to Patient Navigator Cindy Alexander, most new insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act must offer free preventative screenings. But, for those still uninsured and over the age of 50, UMC has some free screenings available.“From Colorado Colorectal Screen Program we’re allotted free screens,” Alexander said, “and also help with treatments if they do have cancer.”Colorectal screenings do not occur at UMC, but in Montrose or Grand Junction through a referral. Through the referral program, any patient who is diagnosed with colorectal cancer could be eligible for $25,000 in treatment.To qualify for the free screenings, a patient must have a household income at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level. A family of four can earn up to $58,875 and still qualify. The individual must also be a current patient at UMC.Last year, UMC was able to donate 15 free screenings through the program. Through that process two patients discovered that they did indeed have colorectal cancer.“They had no idea,” Alexander said, “and we saved their lives. One person was just 50 years old and had to be talked into the screening. The other individual had just started developing cancer, and didn’t need much treatment. If he would have waited another year, it would have been worse.”This year, UMC has been awarded 25 free screenings, and they hope UMC patients will take advantage of the opportunity to be checked.Patient Navigator Tammy Tabor said that patients should not be concerned with the prep or procedure.“The prep is nothing like it used to be. It’s easy to prep for it now, and it’s painless, you’re put under and you don’t even know,” she said.While there can be some signs of colorectal cancer, such as bleeding, often the disease is unrealized.“A person may start getting polyps. When the doctors do the colonoscopy, they excise those and send to pathology. The polyps cause the cancer, and if you have them, they take them out, and you go back in three to five years,” Tabor said.The good news is that if you don’t have any polyps, you can wait another 10 years for a screening.”“But at 50, if you don’t get those removed, by the time you’re 60 you could have a mass and then it’s too late,” Alexander said. “And we’re seeing it in younger populations like we do with breast cancer.”Both Alexander and Tabor said research indicates diet has much to do with prevention in colorectal cancer. Avoiding highly processed foods or extremely fatty foods is advised.But, genetics plays a part too.“If someone has a family history of colorectal cancer, we can get them a colonoscopy at 40 years of age or even earlier,” Alexander said.“It’s sad because it’s so preventable, and still a lot of people die from it. It’s so important to start at age 50 for the screenings,” Tabor said.Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.	Health

742	"CLEVELAND, Ohio – Four hospitals in Northeast Ohio have joined a colorectal cancer prevention and research study that aims to screen everyone in the state diagnosed with colon cancer since Jan. 1, 2013 in an effort to help them avoid additional cancers.Researchers not only want to identify every patient who has a genetic disorder called Lynch syndrome,   they also want to test the patients’ first-degree relatives to see if they, too, are at higher risk of developing colorectal cancer and other cancers. Starting this month, Cleveland Clinic, Fairview Hospital, MetroHealth System and Summa Western Reserve Hospital joined the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative.    The study, which launched at Ohio State University in January 2013 and is being paid for with money raised through Pelotonia (the three-day bicycling event that raises money for cancer research at OSU), now includes 30 hospitals.Of the 700 patients who have already enrolled, 2 percent of them have been identified as having Lynch syndrome. Also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, the condition increases the risk of a recurrence of colon cancer, as well as of developing uterine, ovarian, gastric and kidney cancers.Anyone diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a hospital in Ohio since Jan. 1, 2013 is eligible for the study. As part of the study, patients are provided with free screening for Lynch syndrome. If subsequent genetic testing confirms its presence, close relatives can also get free genetic testing (a blood test or a cheek cell sample collected in mouthwash). Patients who do not test positive for Lynch syndrome (and their families) can still participate in the part of the study that assesses their personal risk for colorectal cancer, and develops a customized screening plan. For information call the Clinical Cancer Genetics Program at Ohio State University at 888-329-1654.By the end of the year, researchers across the state would like to test the stored tumor samples of 2,000 patients to assess their likelihood of having Lynch syndrome. Eventually they want to screen 4,000 patients and provide genetic testing to 8,000 relatives.“For every one patient with Lynch syndrome, three relatives have the mutated gene,” said OSU genetic counselor Heather Hampel, the study’s principal investigator. Once a patient is identified as having Lynch syndrome, relatives can get genetic testing themselves. First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the genetic mutation.For people with Lynch syndrome, getting colonoscopies and other cancer screenings earlier - and more frequently - can help catch the disease at its earliest stages. Preventive surgery, in people with a very strong family history, may be an option as well.Cleveland Clinic, which has the largest tumor registry in North America for hereditary colorectal cancer, wants to enroll 700 patients. MetroHealth already has enrolled 20 patients in the study and want to add 30 more.The gene for Lynch syndrome was first formally identified in the mid-1990s. OSU researchers later discovered how to screen newly diagnosed colon cancer patients by testing a tumor sample.  Studies suggest that about 3 percent of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients carry the genetic mutations. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all such patients be screened, that’s not happening on a routine basis.At the Cleveland Clinic, the routine screening for Lynch syndrome in new colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer patients whose tumors are surgically removed has been in place for several years. “There are definitely red flags,” said Dr. Matthew Kaladay, a colorectal surgeon at the Clinic. Among the signs: a diagnosis at a younger age, cancer on the right side of the colon, and an extensive family history of the disease are among the signals.“I hope we’re able to identify people that we hadn’t been able to before,” Kalady said of the study. “That would make a huge impact, especially on family members.”As far as the research, he said, it’s a chance to raise a lot of awareness not only in the general public but in the medical community as well.“This is kind of the way newborn screening is done, to test for common genetic disorders that are actionable,” Hampel said. “A heel stick [test] is done in the hospital. If something comes back abnormal, patients are referred to a genetic counselor in their region.“Why can’t we mirror this with cancer genetics?” she said. “If this model works, it can be done with cancer.”

	Investigators with Baylor Research Institute, a research arm of Baylor Scott & White Health, have opened participation for a new clinical trial that could determine whether a certain blood test can detect colon cancer before it even develops. Early results of the test, which screens for cancer-related microRNA in a person's blood, appeared positive, as published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. On the heels of those promising findings, researchers are now seeking 400 healthy and treatment-naïve colon or rectal cancer diagnosed participants to measure this non-invasive blood test.
	Led by principal investigator Richard Boland, MD, of Baylor University Medical Center's Division of Gastroenterology, the research explores whether the blood test (which detects the cancer-related biomarker serum miR-21), performed in tandem with regular colonoscopies, can identify patients at high risk for colorectal cancer.
	Currently, colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society. Among those patients diagnosed with colorectal cancers, half are diagnosed at advanced stages. Fewer than 50 percent of Americans undergo screening for colorectal cancer, typically through a standard colonoscopy procedure.
	""Our aim is to improve those sobering statistics and to make available more convenient screening options,"" Dr. Boland said. ""We're encouraged by the initial results and are optimistic that measuring levels of miR-21 in the blood can help identify not only cancer tumors, but also cancer risks.""
	To proceed with the research, investigators have asked for 200 healthy volunteers (who are due for a colonoscopy) and 200 patients diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer who have not undergone chemotherapy or radiation. Upon enrollment in the study, the research coordinator will collect a blood sample prior to the colonoscopy procedure for all participants.Baylor Research InstitutePosted in: Medical Research News | Healthcare NewsTags: Biomarker, Blood, Blood Test, Cancer, Chemotherapy, Clinical Trial, Colon Cancer, Colonoscopy, Colorectal, Colorectal Cancer, Diabetes, Gastroenterology, Health Care, Healthcare, Immunology, microRNA, ResearchCancel reply to commentCharles Mazel, PhDAn interview with Charles Mazel, President of NIGHTSEA, conducted by Barbara Foster, The Microscopy & Imaging Place, Inc.Dr. Rajat MukherjeeData science is a marriage between statistical science and informatics, using statistical principals of math and logic on huge volumes of data.Dr. Thomas MuellerDr. Thomas Mueller is the Director of Product Management in the AFM business unit of Bruker’s Nano Surfaces Division.

*These fields are requiredAfter the Larry Nassar scandal, an expert weighs in on moving forward beyond the world of sports. Also on our nationwide rundown: Conservative union members slam what they term a ""Union-Busting"" bill; and a bill is pending in New England to protect marijuana users.RENO, Nev. - A national awareness campaign under way in March is urging people in Nevada and elsewhere to be screened for one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Cari Herington, executive director, Nevada Cancer Coalition, said Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month is important because early detection and treatment can increase the chances of survival up to 70 percent.

""If folks got screened, if anything is found - any cancerous polyps - they often can be removed immediately,"" Herington said, ""and survival rates are very, very good.""

An estimated 500 Nevadans die from colorectal cancer each year, she said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that it is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans. 

Herington said screening should start at age 50, and having a colonoscopy every 10 years is the ""gold standard"" of screening methods. She added that a less invasive procedure, called the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT Test), can be done at home.

""You mail it in to a lab, and if anything is found through that test, then you can go in for a colonoscopy and further testing and removal of any possible cancers,"" she explained.

Herington said it is also important to be screened if there is a family history of the disease. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 50,000 Americans will die from colorectal cancer this year.

746	"(NEWS CENTER) -- There is a larger than life traveling inflatable colon in Auburn-Lewiston Tuesday. It stands 10-feet high, 12-feet wide, and 12-feet long and allows people to see the inside of a colon. The colon features polyps, cancer and other abnormalities. Registered dieticians will be at the event to discuss healthy colon food. St. Mary's Medical Regional Center is featuring the giant colon Tuesday 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the LePage Large Conference Room. It will then travel to the Auburn Mall and located near the TD Bank from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday. Every year, about 140,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer better known as colon cancer. More than 50,000 people die from it. It is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, colon cancer is one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer, especially when it is caught early. Diane Atwood of the blog Catching Health and former health reporter at NEWS CENTER said many people don't get colonoscopies because of the cost. But there are affordable options. Atwood said under the Affordable Care Act all private health plans must cover colorectal cancer screening tests as a preventative service. There should not be any out-of-pocket costs to patients. The deductible is waived for colorectal cancer screening tests under Medicare, said Atwood. For those without insurance, Maine Colorectal Cancer Control Program offers no-cost cancer screening services. Atwood said to call the Colon Screening Hotline at 1-877-320-6800 for more information.

747	March is National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and anyone who has had the disease or whose family has been impacted by it knows it can be devastating.Colorectal cancer, also known as CRC, occurs when colon or rectum cells become abnormal and cause uncontrolled growth, then form a tumor.“We appreciate any opportunity to educate the public regarding colorectal cancer given that even today with all we try to do to screen patients with colonoscopies, it remains the third most common cancer in both men and women and the second most common cause of cancer death overall,” said Dr. Keith Beiermeister, of San Diego Colon and Rectal Surgeons in La Jolla, which also includes Dr. M. Jonathan Worsey.In 2013, it is estimated that about 143,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.There are a variety of causes of CRC and it tends to develop over several years.It predominantly affects those over 50, which is why it is so important to begin the screening process once individuals reach that age. Screening can include blood tests, a colonoscopy and other methods.Genetics can play a large role in determining a patient’s risk level, but CRC also affects those with no family history of the disease.“Another significant factor thought to play a role in the development of CRC is diet,” said Beiermeister. “It is well established that an individual who ingests a diet that is high in fiber, fruits and vegetables and low in animal fat and red meat will be on average at lower risk for development of CRC. How each of these factors contributes to the development of cancer individually is unknown.”Additional factors thought to play a role in the development of CRC include obesity, decreased physical activity and smoking.The symptoms of CRC can be minimal, especially during the early stages. That’s why doctors recommend screening start at age 50, as there is often no other way to know if a patient is affected.There are some signs that could be a signal, such as rectal pain or bleeding, which are usually an indication that the cancer has advanced. Surgical intervention and chemotherapy will then be administered.There is, however, a treatment which seems to be the most effective.“From a surgical standpoint, the literature has now demonstrated an undeniable advantage to the laparoscopic/minimally invasive approach to both colon and rectal surgery,” said Beiermeister. “At San Diego Colon and Rectal Surgeons, Dr. Worsey and I approach nearly every case, especially elective colon and rectal resections, with a minimally invasive approach.”Robotic colon and rectal resections are also being introduced in a lot of practices, which have shown great promise and could be instrumental in the treatment of CRC. Though medical advancements have opened the doors to new possibilities of treatment, doctors stress prevention and early screenings as the best ways to avoid this disease.	Health

757	"OSAGE BEACH, Mo. — In observance of Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, Lake Regional Health System is offering free fecal occult blood test kits through March 31. The kits are used to detect hidden blood in the stool, which can be a sign of several conditions, including colon cancer.Colorectal cancer is cancer of the colon or rectum and occurs more often in men than women. It develops from polyps — small clumps of cells that form on the colon lining — which can be detected and removed before they become cancerous.According to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States and the third leading cause of cancer death. If detected early, however, it is one of the most curable cancers.Individuals ages 50 and older are at particular risk of developing colorectal cancer. Other risk factors include physical inactivity, obesity, high consumption of red or processed meats, smoking and moderate-to-heavy alcohol consumption, as well as a personal or family history of colorectal cancer or benign (not cancerous) colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease and inherited colorectal cancer.To reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer, physicians recommend regular physical activity and exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, consuming foods high in fiber and calcium, limiting red meat and avoiding processed meats. Smoking cessation and limited consumption of alcohol also are advised.Screenings are recommended for most people beginning at age 50 or when symptoms appear, including changes in bowel movements, rectal cramping and/or bleeding, dark patches of blood in the stool, abdominal discomfort or bloating, unexplained fatigue, loss of appetite and/or weight loss or pelvic pain. However, those at greater risk may need to begin screenings at an earlier age. Common screening options include colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood tests.To request your free test kit, visit lakeregional.com/screeningkit or call 573-302-2858. For more information on colorectal cancer and screening options, talk with your primary care provider or visit www.cancer.org.If you do not have a primary care provider, visit lakeregional.com/physicians, or call Lake Regional Health System’s Physician Referral Line at 573-348-8385.

Early Detection Can Be Key To Treatment Of Colorectal Cancer, Local Doctor Says
“Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with over 56,000 people expected to die from this disease each year.”With that fact, Dr. Joe Sharlow, general surgeon at Ste. Genevieve County Memorial Hospital, is offering advice to help prevent the disease during Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.“It is a preventable and very curable disease if caught early,” Sharlow said.Because there are often no symptoms when it is first developing, colorectal cancer can only be caught early through regular screening.“The benefits of early detection and treatment are dramatic,” Sharlow said. “The possibility of curing patients after symptoms develop is only 50 percent, but if colorectal cancer is found and treated at an early stage before symptoms develop, the opportunity to cure it is 80 percent or better.“Most colon cancers start as non-cancerous growths called polyps. If we are able to find these polyps while they are still non-cancerous, we remove them, and the cancer may be prevented. Major surgery can usually be avoided, as well.”Screening GuidelinesPrevention TipsSharlow noted that in addition to getting screened regularly for colorectal cancer, people can lower their risk of getting the disease by:“National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month is a great opportunity to openly discuss the disease and learn what can be done to prevent it,” Sharlow said. “Understanding risk factors, symptoms and screening options could mean the difference between life and death. I hope people will take our message of being screened to heart and, by doing so, help us realize our vision of a future free of colon cancer.”Private health insurance, Medicaid or Medicare benefits can be used to obtain a colorectal cancer screening. For more information about the procedure, talk to your medical provider, or call (573) 883-5717 to schedule your colonoscopy.

Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 12:56 pmATLANTA -- While a combination of earlier detection and better treatments have yielded a steady decline in the colorectal cancer death rate over the past 20 years, colorectal cancer will kill an estimated 50,310 people in the U.S. in 2014, including 340 in Nebraska, according to the American Cancer Society.Colorectal cancer is one of only a handful of cancers for which screening is proven to save lives, both by finding and removing polyps before they turn cancerous and by finding cancers early, when treatment is most likely to be successful.During March, National Colon Cancer Awareness Month, the American Cancer Society is highlighting the need to do more to save lives from the nation’s third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women by urging patients and their doctors to talk about the importance of colorectal cancer screening, which is recommended for people at average risk beginning at age 50.“Although screening guidelines differ for some cancers, this is not the case for colorectal cancer,” said Richard C. Wender, M.D., chief cancer control officer for the American Cancer Society and chair of the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. “All guidelines recommend screening with either colonoscopy every 10 years or a stool test at home every year, and the benefit of screening is clear. Colon cancer screening accomplishes two things – it prevents colon cancers from developing by removing polyps and it detects cancers early when it is highly curable.”More than 1 in 3 adults aged 50 and older are not being screened as recommended for colorectal cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends that most people begin regular screening at age 50. People at higher risk, such as those with a family history of colon cancer, may need to start screening earlier.“A great number of people do not understand that there are choices for being screened,” Wender added. “If patients are offered a choice among several screening options, then we can increase the chance they will get screened. As we like to say: the best test for you is the one you get.”The Society recommends the following colorectal cancer screening tests:• Tests that detect precancerous polyps and cancer:o Flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years; oro Colonoscopy every 10 years; oro Double contrast barium enema (DCBE) every five years; oro CT colonography (CTC) every five years.• Tests that primarily detect cancer:o Yearly guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) with high test sensitivity for cancer (older versions of the Fecal Occult Blood Test should not be used to test for colorectal cancer); oro Yearly fecal immunochemical test (FIT) with high test sensitivity for cancer; oro Stool DNA test (sDNA).Tests that detect precancerous polyps allow doctors to remove the polyps and potentially prevent cancer altogether. And while cancers detected at the earliest stage have a five-year survival rate of 90 percent, only 40 percent of colon cancers are currently detected at this stage, partly because too few people are screened.The Society is increasing efforts during March and beyond to ensure more people are aware of the lifesaving potential of screenings. As co-founders of the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, a coalition of 80 member organizations working to improve screening rates in the US, the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are committed to significantly increasing screening rates.""Public policies such as the Affordable Care Act are improving access to colon cancer screening, but we have a lot of work to do to ensure everyone has the opportunity to be screened,"" Wender said.The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), the Society's nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate, strongly supported provisions of the Affordable Care Act that reduce or eliminate the cost of colorectal cancer screening and other proven prevention services for patients and require most health plans to cover them.ACS CAN supports congressional legislation that would lift a financial burden for people living on a fixed income by ensuring men and women on Medicare receive these lifesaving screenings without risking cost sharing. ACS CAN is also working to increase federal funding of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Colorectal Cancer Control Program, which provides screenings to low-income and uninsured people.For more information and guidance on colorectal cancer, visit cancer.org/fightcoloncancer or call the American Cancer Society 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 800-227-2345.We’re writing to thank you for your activating your full access subscription including all madison.com websites, mobile apps and more.

764	GRAND FORKS — Terry Harmon took some good-natured ribbing when he turned 50 in January 2013.But Harmon was feeling “strong and healthy,” and not inclined to heed Tom’s advice to get screened for colorectal cancer.“I had no loss of weight, I had a good appetite,” said Harmon, who lives in Grand Forks. “I was sleeping well.”He didn’t relish the idea of a colonoscopy, but “something said I should do it.”Maybe it was the picture of a good friend he keeps on his bedroom dresser, he said. A few years ago, at age 39, this friend lost his life to cancer by ignoring symptoms and neglecting to get medical care that might have made a difference.Harmon had a colonoscopy in late March.During the procedure, Dr. Robin Hape, a general surgeon at Altru Health System, found and removed seven polyps, small growths on the wall of the colon, or large intestine, that can develop into cancer.He also noticed an abnormal area from which he took a sample, or biopsy, for closer analysis. The polyps turned out to be noncancerous, but the biopsy, Harmon learned later, revealed cancer that had invaded three of the colon’s four layers.“I just started shaking,” he said, when Hape gave him the news. He peppered the doctor with questions: “What do I need to do? How do we handle this?”Hape quickly set up several appointments for Harmon to undergo further medical tests. The same day that he received the news, Harmon was on his way to Altru for a blood draw. He was “frazzled” during the procedure but didn’t let on to anyone how he felt.The diagnosis hit him when he returned to his pickup, he said. “I broke down.”Delay or denyLike many men, Harmon hadn’t paid close attention to his health and didn’t follow an especially healthy diet and lifestyle, he said.“I think men are less aware of the fact that something could be wrong,” he said. “They don’t want to know that something is wrong. Or they feel it’s not necessary to go in” for screening.The expense may be a deterrent for some, he said.“The biggest thing is, if you have good insurance, and (reasonable) copay, it will save you (money) in the long run.”Most people are fearful of colonoscopy, Hape said. “But after they have it done, they find it’s not so bad.”Improvements in the initial step of the procedure — emptying the bowel of its contents — have made colonoscopy a little easier on patients, he said. Some people “just gamble,” Hape said. “They say, ‘It (cancer) can’t happen to me.’“I think everyone with cancer has probably said that at some time in their lives.”Avoid cancer completelyColorectal cancer differs from other types of cancer in one important aspect, Hape said. “With other cancers, the best you can do is find it early,” but the cancer is already present.Colonoscopy allows doctors to locate and remove polyps before they become cancerous, he said. “With colorectal cancer, you can prevent cancer from happening at all — that’s the greatest thing.”It takes up to five years for these tiny polyps to grow and turn into cancer, he said.Of the 70 or so colorectal cancer cases Altru physicians identify each year, “I’d estimate that 60 of those would be completely preventable if they had gotten scoped early,” Hape said.Dr. Anthony Chu, gastroenterologist at Altru, said, “With colonoscopy, we’re not really checking for cancer but really catching the precursor to cancer — looking for the polyp which occurs before that.”People are getting cancer at younger ages, Chu said, but those 50 and older are at the highest risk for colorectal cancer. Early detection is critical for this age group because 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women will have a polyp.Cancer that has spread, or metastasized, to other organs is categorized as stage 4, he said. At this stage, the five-year survival rate is 5 percent.When cancer is detected at earlier stages, 2 or 3 — when other organs are not affected — the survival rate jumps to 70 percent. At stage 1, it’s more than 90 percent, he said.“Our best screening tool is the colonoscopy,” Chu said.He’s concerned that, of the North Dakotans eligible for colon cancer screening — those 50 and older with no family history — half are not getting screened, said Chu, who added that Altru has committed to cutting its rate of late-stage colon cancers by half in the next five years.  TreatmentAfter recovering from five weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, Harmon underwent surgery in June to remove the cancer.Treatment had reduced the tumor from about 4 inches in length to much smaller than the size of a nickel, Hape said.Eight inches of colon was removed to ensure “a margin” around the tumor and increase the likelihood that all cancer cells are taken, Hape said. The cancer had not spread to other parts of the body.In the operation, surgeons rerouted Harmon’s intestine and created an ileostomy, an opening constructed by bringing part of the small intestine to the skin surface to permit waste elimination into an external bag attached to the front of the body — a temporary measure that allows the colon time to rest and heal, Hape said. Harmon’s youth and general health worked in his favor, Hape said.“Terry is young and otherwise so healthy. He’s tolerated chemo and radiation well, and bounced back from surgery.”Some complications, including a blood infection, have slowed his progress toward full recovery, Harmon said, but he’s anxious to return to his job, when approved by his doctor, and ride his scooter this summer.   Encouraging                       the reluctantHarmon said some of his friends have had colorectal screening because of what he has gone through. But he knows others who are reluctant could also benefit.The number of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer could be less if it’s caught sooner, he said.Harmon’s mother, Marie Harmon of East Grand Forks, Minn., has become “a sounding board for me,” he said. “She’s a positive thinker.”She’s also “a spiritual woman who believes everything happens for a reason,” he said. “She said it was by ‘divine intervention’ that I went in for the colonoscopy when I did.“She said, ‘What if you had been too proud’ to have it done?”If Harmon had delayed the colonoscopy six to 12 months or put it off altogether, a permanent colostomy, rerouting of the colon to eliminate waste through an external bag, would have been necessary, Hape said.‘Made me stronger’The experience with cancer has “made me stronger,” Harmon said. “I am more adamant about taking care of myself.”He recommends colorectal screening to others, and tells his story to those who ask him.He has become “not a crusader but an informant — somebody who’d like to spread the word,” he said. “It would only do good.”The battle with cancer raised his concern for others in his life.“The friends I have, what if they have something in them? I care enough to force the issue … I wouldn’t want anyone else to go through what I have.” Taking time to get screened “is not that big of a deal,” he said. “One day of your life could save your life.”	Health
765	March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States that affects both men and women, and it's preventable.Dr. Paula Walker from Columbus State University tells us more.Every year, about 140,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and about 50,000 die of the disease. However, colorectal cancer is highly preventable and is one of the most treatable forms of cancer. The risk to develop the cancer advances with age. Other risk factors include smoking, an inflammatory bowel disease, family history of the disease and genetic symptoms. A colonoscopy can be performed to screen for the disease. Individuals should start getting colonoscopy screenings starting at the age of 50 and every ten years afterward as long as the first screening is clear. Another test involves sampling stool for blood. To prevent colorectal cancer, Walker recommends you avoid smoking and alcohol intake. Increase your physical activity and avoid gaining weight around your midsection. Watch the video for more details.Copyright 2014 WTVM.

	Colon cancer will take more than 50,000 American lives in 2014 making it the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. Yet more than 90 percent of colon cancer cases can be prevented by screening. So why have only 63 percent of Americans aged 50 to 75 been screened for colon cancer?
	Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) experts are committed to reducing the number of colon cancer deaths each year and have developed a helpful tool to simplify colon cancer prevention and screening guidelines. The 'This One Thing Could Save Your Life' infographic provides risk factors and screening recommendations, as well as information to help reduce the fear associated with colonoscopies.
	The infographic is available on SCCA's website at www.sccablog.org/this-one-thing-could-save-your-life/ and can also be shared across social networks to help raise awareness with friends and family.
	Following guidelines from the American Cancer Society, SCCA recommends men and women have regular colon cancer screenings beginning at age 50. Screening tests allow doctors to spot cancer in the colon or rectum at an early stage, when it's easier to cure. Regular exams also help prevent cancer by finding polyps or lesions that can be removed before they become cancerous. This lifesaving procedure can often be done during the colonoscopy screening.
	""Colon cancer screening is proven to save lives,"" said Dr. John Inadomi, colon cancer gastroenterologist at SCCA and head of the Division of Gastroenterology at the University of Washington. ""Considering up to 90 percent of cases are preventable, it is essential that all men and women starting at age 50 be screened regularly.""
Who Should Get Screened?
• Beginning at age 50: Annual check-ups and screenings are the best line of defense in terms of early detection. SCCA recommends men and women get a colonoscopy every ten years beginning at age 50.
• Men and women who believe they are at high risk: SCCA recommends those who believe they are at a higher risk of developing colon cancer talk to their doctor about their risk factors and screening recommendations. Colon cancer risk factors include:
	• A first-degree relative with colon cancer
	• Smoking
	• Inflammatory bowel disease
	• A diet high in red or processed meats and low in fruits and vegetables
	• A history of ovarian or endometrial cancer (among women)
The Colonoscopy, A Misunderstood Procedure
	The colonoscopy is often misunderstood and is in fact a simple and painless procedure. However, according to the Colon Cancer Alliance, a patient advocacy group, the main reason people skip getting screened is a fear of prepping for the procedure, the screening process itself, and receiving test results. It is important people recognize that colon cancer may not present any signs or symptoms until the disease is advanced. Regular colon cancer screening can help save 30,000 lives every year. So what does the screening process entail?
• The day before the exam: Patients are asked to follow a clear liquid diet and take laxatives to help clean the bowels.
• During the procedure: Light sedation is provided to patients prior to the procedure to avoid any discomfort. During the 30 minute exam, polyps or lesions are removed, without the need for additional procedures.
• After the procedure: Patients may experience mild cramping or bloating that generally subsides within 24 hours.Seattle Cancer Care AlliancePosted in: Medical Research News | Medical Condition NewsTags: Bloating, Cancer, Cancer Prevention, Colon Cancer, Colonoscopy, Diet, Doctor, Endometrial Cancer, Gastroenterology, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Light, Smoking, VegetablesCancel reply to commentCharles Mazel, PhDAn interview with Charles Mazel, President of NIGHTSEA, conducted by Barbara Foster, The Microscopy & Imaging Place, Inc.Dr. Rajat MukherjeeData science is a marriage between statistical science and informatics, using statistical principals of math and logic on huge volumes of data.Dr. Thomas MuellerDr. Thomas Mueller is the Director of Product Management in the AFM business unit of Bruker’s Nano Surfaces Division.

769	"March 11--Gary Hemingway twice had been scheduled for colonoscopies. He'd been prescribed the laxative preparation to use the day before the exam. And then he backed out.""They just gave me some stuff,"" Hemingway said. ""They didn't really explain it all to me.""Then he ran into Renay Caldwell, who helps patients navigate through the colonoscopy process in her role with the S.C. Colon Cancer Prevention Network. Caldwell, and the network, likely saved Hemingway's life. The Columbia resident finally went through with a colonoscopy, a large polyp was found and it was removed before it would almost certainly have become cancerous.The even better news is that increased funding and more participation by physicians this year will allow the network to increase the number of free colonoscopies it can provide -- from about 100 per year to 800. Each of those procedures has the potential to send out ripples that will improve the health of many more than the patients checked.""It's advocacy,"" said Dr. Frank Berger, the leader of the network. ""The people who do this are going to their family and friends and telling them. ... So much of (the reluctance) to getting colonoscopies is a social issue. We're chipping away at that barrier one patient at a time.""For instance, Hemingway now helps the network spread the word about the need for colorectal exams. He has recruited colonoscopy candidates at his church, telling them the process isn't a big deal but the results can be life-saving.""If I hadn't run into Renay Caldwell, I wouldn't have went,"" Hemingway said. ""I thank the Lord she was there.""Colon cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the country and the second leading cause of cancer death in South Carolina. Yet it's preventable with early detection, and removal, of polyps in the colon through colonoscopies.""The goal with prostate and breast cancer screening is to detect it early to treat and cure it,"" said Dr. March Seabrook, a Columbia gastroenterologist. ""The goal with colon cancer screening is to prevent it.""The rule of thumb is for most people to get checked around age 50, though African-American men and those with family history of colon cancer should get checked in their 40s.While South Carolina ranks near the bottom in the number of colon cancer deaths per capita, the state ranks in the middle of the pack in cancer screening rates. About 64 percent of South Carolinians age 50-75 reported having had a colorectal screening test, according to a 2012 accounting by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Massachusetts was No. 1 with 76.3 percent getting tested. Arkansas was worst with 55.7 percent.One major problem in South Carolina is that the percentage getting tested is lowest among a group statistically most likely to develop colon cancer -- African-American men. And testing rates are especially low for people without insurance because of the expense of colonoscopies.The S.C. Colon Cancer Prevention Network has focused its efforts at those groups.This year the network should be especially busy because, after running a pilot screening program for several years thanks to grants from BlueCross BlueShield of SC, others jumped on board to increase funding.BlueCross came through with another $171,950, two-year grant for clinical services, the Duke Endowment provided a $450,000, two-year grant for navigators to help patients through the process and for evaluation of the effort, and the state legislature kicked in $500,000.The network estimates it will be able to provide free colonoscopies for 800 people this year, compared with 550 in the 2008-2013 period. The effort has expanded from two counties to 28.Most patients are referred from free clinics or federally qualified health centers to gastroenterologists who have volunteered to perform a certain number of the free exams each year. (Their practices are paid the Medicaid rate for the procedure, but the physicians waive their separate fee.)Despite the procedures being free, many candidates still balked at the opportunity. ""When you give away something, it's not appreciated,"" Seabrook said.That's why navigators such as Caldwell are important. She not only explained the procedure's importance to Hemingway, she also sat down with him and watched a video on the subject. She thoroughly detailed the preparation process. She reminded him what needed to be done each step along the way.""If we get them in the front door, they get it,"" Caldwell said. ""We try to make it a personal experience, not just wham, bam, you're done.""Based on general population statistics, the 800 exams this year will save two or three lives and about $500,000 in medical costs, Berger said. And those savings will be multiplied if more patients follow the lead of Hemingway.""I talked to one of my friends at church about how important it was,"" Hemingway said. ""I called Ms. Caldwell and gave her his number. And now he's scheduled for an exam.""___(c)2014 The State (Columbia, S.C.)Visit The State (Columbia, S.C.) at www.thestate.comDistributed by MCT Information ServicesExperient Health Takes on Health and Fitness in Live Well, Work Well SeriesConvergys closes doors; Maximus plans work-force reductionGet breaking news, exclusive stories, and money- making insights straight into your inbox.

Health Sciences North and the Cancer Prevention and Screening Network are teaming up with ColonCancerCheck and hockey leagues in the North to make hockey fans aware that early detection of colorectal cancer through screening can be a game changer.Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death and the third most diagnosed cancer in Ontario. March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.The Ontario Hockey League’s Sudbury Wolves, North Bay Battalion and Sault Greyhounds will join other teams in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League and hold special events at games in March to remind fans screening saves lives.Members of the Cancer Prevention and Screening Network will be on hand to urge fans to speak to their health-care providers about getting screened.In 2013, an estimated 8,700 Ontarians — about 4,800 men and 3,900 women — were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Ontarians aged 50 to 74 years should be screened for colorectal cancer.“It’s exciting to see our hockey partners supporting Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and our public health unit and Canadian Cancer Society partners out there spreading the message among hockey fans,” said Dr. Amanda Hey, regional primary care lead with the Northeast Cancer Centre at Health Sciences North.“It’s such an important message: When it’s caught at its earliest stages, there is a 90% chance of cure from colorectal cancer,"" said Hey.There are often no symptoms in the early stages of colorectal cancer. Screening can detect the disease at its earliest stages when treatment is most effective.For those at average risk, the at-home fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is recommended every two years. For those at increased risk because of a family history (a parent, sibling or child) with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, a colonoscopy is advised beginning at age 50 or 10 years earlier than the age at which the relative was diagnosed.FOBT kits can be obtained through health care providers or by calling Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.The success of this unique partnership, which began in Windsor in 2011, is evident provincewide. Hockey arenas have proven to be good venues for health education, providing access to target audiences in a non-clinical, non-threatening environment.For more information on cancer screening and the right time to get screened, visit www.ontario.ca/screenforlife and complete the Time to Screen tool. If you already have an account on this newspaper, you can login to the newspaper to add your comments.

774	ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (March 10, 2014) – It’s the type of cancer no one wants to talk about, but colon cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality and a colonoscopy screening can help catch the cancer at an early stage. With March being national Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, Northwest Community Healthcare’s Medical Group is hosting a free community health seminar. “Why should I get a colonoscopy?,” presented by Dr. Ami Behara of the NCH Medical Group, is scheduled at 6 p.m. on Thursday, March 27, in the NCH auditorium, 800 W. Central Road in Arlington Heights.Dr. Behara is a board-certified gastroenterologist who will discuss risk factors, colon screening guidelines and options for screening. Dr. Behara will answer questions and dispel common misconceptions.Approximately 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and almost 50,000 people will die from colon cancer. Screening can prevent cancer through the removal of pre-cancerous polyps, and for those with colon cancer, improve survival through early detection.While the March event is free, registration is required because space is limited. Attendees also can sign up by calling HealthConnection at 847.618.4968. Complimentary beverages and snacks are available. Attendees should park in the Visitor Garage on the east side of the campus and follow the signs to the event.For more details about Northwest Community Hospital’s Gastroenterology Center and its comprehensive services, visit the hospital’s website at nch.org/colon.# # #About NCH Medical GroupNCH Medical Group is the physician group belonging to the Northwest Community Healthcare comprehensive, patient-centered system of care that serves more than 350,000 outpatients each year, as well as nearly 30,000 inpatients treated annually at the 496-bed acute care hospital in Arlington Heights.

778	"Mar 13, 2014 09:30 AM EDT | By Staff WriterAbout 20 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration introduced Nutrition Facts labels for the first time. Since then, though, food labels have remained largely unchanged. Now, the FDA is finally giving them a much-needed overhaul, which could encourage the public to eat healthier.The main revision to the food labels will be serving sizes. Currently, a package of something can have multiple servings within it. For example, a single muffin may be listed as containing two servings, despite being only one item.  While a single serving may be 200 calories, the entire muffin would be 400 calories. This means that there's the illusion that the muffin has fewer calories than it actually does.Further details are still being debated, according to The Huffington Post. The FDA have released two proposed options for the labels, and will be gathering feedback until late May. Yet once these details are finally settled, food makers will have just two years to updated their labels to comply with the new format.So what should we expect? The new label will emphasize calories, added sugar and serving size. It's also unlikely to show ""calories from fat,"" since the information doesn't have any real relevance to good nutrition, according to SF Gate.

It looks like the food level changes are also getting support from the Grocery Manufacturers association. In a written statement, the trade group said, ""For 20 years, the Nutrition Facts panel has been an invaluable tool to help consumers build more healthful diets for themselves and their families, and the time is right for an update. We look forward to working with the FDA and other stakeholders as these proposed updates to the Nutrition Facts label make their way through the rule-making process.""We'll likely see more official announcements in late May, once all of the details have been released. Yet the proposed changes could mean better information for consumers across the United States-and an easier way to choose healthier food options.SHARE YOUR THOUGHTSYou have already subscribed.

779	More than two decades ago, the Nutrition Facts label was introduced for the first time. But now, the Food and Drug Administration thinks that the labeling needs to have complete makeover.The FDA said that changes are required in the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels, revision is required in the serving sizes of foods that can be consumed at one-eating time and update, modification and establishment of certain reference amounts customarily consumed.Through these and other changes, the FDA wants to come up with new food packaging that reflects a number of public health initiatives taken from time to time. Some of them include obesity and chronic diseases.By revising the Nutrition Facts label, the FDA does not mean to dictate what people should be eating. But it is about providing better and updated information to consumers, so they can take informed decisions. It has been found that one-time labeling change will cost around $2.3 billion to the industry.Some of the things that will be removed from the label as per the proposed rule are footnote table that includes reference value for diet having 2,000 and 2,500 calories. Moreover, vitamin A and C and 'calories from Fat' will also be removed.But if manufacturers want to list the vitamins A and C then they can do so. To talk about the things that will be added to the label are added sugar, vitamin D and potassium. 'Total Carbs' would replace 'Total Carbohydrates'.With an objective to raise awareness among consumers about the extra sugar they are taking from food, the FDA has included the listing of 'Added Sugars'. Calorie count would be the most important feature of label, so that readers are able to identify the calories per serving.Lastly, the serving sizes will be changed to reflect what consumers customarily consume. The proposed rules will be open for public comment for 90 days and the final rules will get effective in 60 days after the date of publication.Life is becoming busier than ever and the food...A truck driver, who is on trial for an accident...A container ship sailing around 500km north of New...When tragedies like Orlando shooting incident...Shares of Baidu dropped five percent during the...On Tuesday, Crude oil futures dropped during early...

781	"The Food and Drug Administration has proposed changes for nutrition fact labels to help educate the public on healthy eating habits and prevent obesity.The Food and Drug Administration has proposed changes for nutrition fact labels to help educate the public on healthy eating habits and prevent obesity.In the past, walking into the grocery store and finding food that was considered “good” for you had been a challenge. Picking up a can of soup and reading the label does not tell you what percentage of additives or sugars the product may contain. To solve this and other problems, the Food and Drug Administration has announced new regulations for the labels printed on foodstuffs.Now, when looking at the same can of soup, the display of nutrition facts will be changed and the daily value percentage has been placed first, in hopes that this will change the way we read the label.One of the changes that is being included on the new labels is the amount of added sugars in the product. We all remember when we were little kids and our mothers said that too much sugar was bad for us. With the new labels, we will be able to tell exactly how much sugar is being added to the products we buy.Also, a new column that includes the amount of calories per serving size is being added to food labels. No one in the grocery store wants to stand there doing mental math to figure out how many calories they would be eating in just one serving. Calculating a serving size is further complicated when people don’t even know exactly what a given serving size is.In recent years, the portion size has changed, but what has not been changed is the serving sizes printed on food labels. Nutritional facts should be based on what people are actually eating and compared to a normal human diet, rather than the diet that people should theoretically be eating. It seems that in today’s world the only people who are actually counting calories are people who are dieting, or watching their weight.More so than others, college students do not exactly count their calories when grabbing a slice of pizza. Therefore it is safe to assume we are not sticking to the amount of calories we are supposed to consume. Basing the portion size on what people are actually eating will undoubtedly be more beneficial to the consumer. “By revamping the Nutrition Facts label, FDA wants to make it easier than ever for consumers to make better informed food choices that will support a healthy diet,” said Michael R. Taylor, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for foods. “To help address obesity, one of the most important public health problems facing our country, the proposed label would drive attention to calories and serving sizes.”Iowa State prides itself on being a healthy campus, so it is no surprise that the need for the new labels is in high demand. Students with food allergies or students that are diabetic have to pay closer attention to the amount of additives in a food product. These new labels will make it easier for these students to regulate their health, making it easier for students to not only find the information but understand what they are reading. Students that are paying attention to what is being written on these labels are going to greatly appreciate the new design.“This is a big deal, and it’s going to make a big difference for families all across this country,” said First Lady Michelle Obama. Hopefully this will not only make a difference in the meals we are eating, but move Iowa State students to have healthier eating habits and an healthier overall lifestyle.Opinions expressed in columns and letters are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Daily or organizations with which the author(s) are associated. Feedback policy: The Daily encourages discussion but does not guarantee its publication.

782	"People should be able to go into a grocery store, look at the food label and be able to tell whether or not  a food item is healthy.Unless you have a degree in nutrition and a calculator on you at all times, nutrition labels on goods will always be overlooked.The labeling system needs to be updated to better fit the way Americans consume food.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new change in food labeling that could dramatically affect the way Americans eat, according to The New York Times.The major changes to the nutrition labels on food packages include putting calorie amounts in large print and adjusting serving sizes to better reflect how much Americans really eat today.This would be the first significant change in food labels since the government started requiring them in the early 1990s.Even those nutrition labels that we still use today are based on eating habits and nutrition data from the 1970s and 1980s, also according to The New York Times.Eating habits and diets have changed significantly since then, and labels on food need to be changed to better suit the twenty-first century.Changing the way Americans look at nutrition labeling would dramatically change diets by lowering the risk of obesity and other health problems.According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, one-third of adults are obese, as reported by Healthday.com.By making adjustments to labels, more people would be aware of what they are consuming.Having a separate line for manufactured sugars and other added substances that may lead to health problems would help people become more aware of what they’re eating.Making print larger on labels would help make the nutritional facts more obvious.For example, instead of labeling a bottle of soda as 2.5 servings, it could be labeled as one bottle per serving, thus making the confusion of serving sizes much simpler to understand.Since the serving sizes on nutrition labels are usually in small print and put in a spot where they are not as noticeable, it would be beneficial for the consumer to put  a whole bottle as one serving when looking at the other nutritional facts, so it can be interpreted in a more straightforward manner.Millions of Americans pay attention to product identification, but that also means there are millions of Americans who do not. Jacob Knehr can be contacted at jknehr@keene-equinox.comYes, I have the same opinion about this article. I think, the change in food labels will affect the diet of Americans. It maybe in a positive way because they will become more aware and curious of the new labels that will make them look about the nutritional facts of the food again.This will make Americans conscious also of their diet.

785	"By Stacy FinzCaptionCloseJuliet Sims, a registered dietitian, said consumers need to let their voices be heard on a proposed new nutrition label recently unveiled by the first lady and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Not since 1993, when the Nutrition Facts label was first introduced on the sides and backs of food packages, has there been much change to reflect science - or reality, for that matter.For one, people are eating larger portions than they did last century. Since the original Nutrition Facts label, scientists have discovered that some fats, such as olive oil, nuts and avocados, are actually good for you. And that added sugar is bad - linked to obesity, heart disease and diabetes.But now, the new label would take advantage of these discoveries with a redesign that emphasizes calories, added sugar and serving sizes. No longer would the label show ""calories from fat,"" since scientists don't believe the information has any relevance to good nutrition.""It's been a long time in coming,"" Sims said of the proposed label changes. ""But it's a really positive change.""Like many who welcome the revamped label, Sims is concerned that big food companies, with their powerful lobbies, will push back. That's why she's urging consumers to take advantage of the government's 90-day public comment period to speak up, because the FDA will make its decision based on the response.""We shouldn't have any illusions that big food manufacturers won't oppose the changes,"" said Sims, who works for the Prevention Institute, an Oakland nonprofit dedicated to improving health and quality of life.But the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the trade group that represents leading food and beverage companies, has said that it backs the proposal introduced by first lady Michelle Obama.""For 20 years, the Nutrition Facts panel has been an invaluable tool to help consumers build more healthful diets for themselves and their families, and the time is right for an update,"" the organization said in a written statement. ""We look forward to working with the FDA and other stakeholders as these proposed updates to the Nutrition Facts label make their way through the rule-making process.""It is critical that any changes are based on the most current and reliable science. Equally as important is ensuring that any changes ultimately serve to inform, and not confuse, consumers.""The Grocery Manufacturers Association has embarked on its own labeling campaign, which includes ""Facts Up Front,"" an initiative to take specific information from the facts panel and promote it on the front of the package.In the meantime, the FDA's proposed facts panel includes an update of serving sizes to make them more realistic with the portion sizes Americans eat. Currently, a pint of ice cream is listed as four one-half cup servings. That would change to two one-cup servings. The calorie content would reflect those changes as well.The design of the label will also get a new look, with calorie numbers written in a larger font size and bolder print, so consumers can readily find the information.But some say the most important change is that for the first time the label will include the amount of added sugar per serving.Sugary diets have been linked to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Added sugar is any sweetener that isn't derived in a product naturally, and it has many names, including cane juice, fruit juice concentrate, high-fructose corn syrup and honey. Fruit on the other hand has natural sugar, which is a form of fiber and is good for you.""The added sugar on the label is a really big deal,"" said Katie Ferraro, a registered dietitian and an assistant clinical professor at UCSF. ""This is going to really help people, because before it was nearly impossible to know how much added sugar was in a product.""Christina Goette, director of the Department of Public Health's Shape Up San Francisco initiative, just wishes that the proposal included daily recommendations for how much added sugar is OK, before it becomes too much.The World Health Organization says people should consume no more than six teaspoons a day. A teaspoon - or a sugar cube or one of those packets in coffee shops or restaurants - equals four grams of sugar. In new guidelines just released, the U.N.'s health agency recommends no more than 10 percent of daily calories should be added sugar. Ideally, people should keep added sugar consumption to below 5 percent of daily calories, according to the organization.Rheema Calloway, a 23-year-old Ingleside resident, would just like any guidance she can get. She's trying to watch her weight and her diet, especially because diabetes runs in her family. Both her aunt and sister have it.She regularly peruses ingredient labels on food packages, but is often baffled by what they mean. And the Nutrition Facts box - forget about it.Who would think a 20-ounce bottle of soda has multiple servings? That's what she wants to know.""If you buy a soda, you're going to drink the whole thing,"" she said. ""The calories should reflect that.""And under the new label they would. Instead of being 2 1/2 servings - the way it is now - a 20-ounce bottle of soda will simply be one serving. No math involved. The FDA is not advocating that people drink more, it's just making the amount of calories the bottle contains abundantly clear.Annie Lyles, a 36-year-old mother and Oakland social worker, said she feels as if she needs a degree in nutrition just to pack a lunch. That's how confusing labels can be. She welcomes any changes that will make it easier for her to make better choices.""I don't want to do math to figure out the serving size,"" she said. ""As a result I have really limited the amount of packaged food I buy.""UCSF's Ferraro said that's a good thing. She's happy about the prospect of a new nutrition label, but she still advocates that people buy less packaged foods and eat fresh - produce, nuts and whole grains.In fact, she wishes the FDA would've included a line for the percentage of whole grains per serving. Now, a product can promote itself as a whole-grain food with very few whole grains.For dietitian Sims, she'll take what she can get.""These are huge improvements,"" she said. ""I can't talk about the proposal without starting to smile.""The Food and Drug Administration will make a decision on the proposed food labels based largely on the feedback it receives during a 90-day public comment period. Comments can be registered at www.regulations.gov.After the 90-day comment period, the FDA will make a final ruling. The agency has no deadline for ruling, but once the final rules are published, the food industry will have two years to comply.Stacy Finz is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

786	“Mum don’t forget to get me my favourite yoghurt”. What if your favourite is not available? I asked. “Then get me one that looks like my favourite and  remember to check the label”, she added.This was between my daughter and I.  Over the years I’ve taught her how to read labels before consuming any packaged food, snacks, drinks etc. So she won’t forget. Many of us are guilty of this. We don’t remember to read labels before buying processed foods.One of the things we struggle with daily, all over the world is to make distinction between facts and ruse, as manufacturers compete to make impression in the minds of men through aggressive  advertisement in order to increase sales. Our markets are filled with an over-whelming number of food products from which to choose. But how do we know which  food will give us the most nutrients for our money?Eating nutritiously in this day and age can be a challenge. Many professionals agree that the pesticides, hormones and additives in our diets are the culprits behind many diseases and health challenges, and these things can be especially harmful to children.Healthy eating starts with knowing the facts about what you are putting in your mouth. Reading nutrition labels can help you make wise food choices; knowing how to read the “Nutrition Facts” on a food label and not relying on phrases like “healthy” or “low-fat” is a key step. Being in better control of your eating habits helps you to feel in better control of other aspects of your life. Food is not the enemy; it has sustained us for decades. Eating should be an adventure and not an ordeal. This article can help you make quick, informed choices that contribute to healthy eating through more informed label reading.Whenever possible invest a little extra in organic fruits and vegetables. By increasing the quality of your overall diet with nutritious whole foods and lots of pure, fresh water, you are supporting your body’s ability to neutralise and remove these toxins quickly.You don’t have to become a fanatic to maintain a healthy body. But it does help to tune in to the potential basis. Become aware and start making little shifts in your nutritional habits. Your body will thank you.Now that you have a better handle on what to eat, you need to be able to discern what is inside those packages you are pulling off the shelves.you will be amazed at what you can learn (and how your choices will change) When you take the time to read the labels on all your potential purchases.Don’t assume all similar foods have the same components. Reading labels accurately is essential, because it is important to make choices based on complete information. Check out the sample label next time you go shopping.Serving SizeAlways check the serving size first. If you eat more or less, you must adjust your calories accordingAt the top of the label, you will see the serving size and the number of servings per container. Serving sizes differ on each food label and may not equal the serving size you normally eat. If you eat twice the serving listed on the label, you will need to double all the numbers in the nutritional facts section.Daily ValueThis tells you  how much of a day’s worth of fat, sodium, calories, etc., the food provides based on a two thousand calorie diet. It does not tell you the actual percentage in the food item. (you must do the calculation yourself).Calories From FatThis section on the label tells you the total number of calories in each serving of the food and the number of those calories which are derived from fat. Calories provide a measure of how much energy you get from eating one serving of the food. If you are trying to manage (lose, gain or maintain) your weight, the number of calories you consume counts. For example, one serving of spaghetti and beef may provide 250 calories, with 110 calories from fat. If you ate 2 servings, you would consume 500 calories and 220 of those calories would be from fat.Add up the “Total Fat”. Total fat includes fats that are good for you, such as monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and omega-3 fats (usually from liquid and plant sources, such as canola oil and nuts) and fats that are not so good, such as saturated and trans fats (from animal or vegetable sources). Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can help lower your blood cholesterol and protect your heart. Trans fats are also known as “hydrogenated” and “partially hydrogenated” fats. These are formed during the process of converting liquid oils into solid fats, such as shortening and stick margarine. Hydrogenation increases the shelf life and stabilizes the flavour of these fats. Partially hydrogenated fats are currently considered the worst fats for our health.Now you can see just how many calories are coming from fat. You will have to do the math to compute the actual percentage. An easy rule of thumbs is:15% fat = 1.5 grams per 100 calories20% fat= 2.0grams per 100 calories25% fat= 2.5 grams per 100 caloriesCholestrolThis tells you how much cholesterol you get from eating one serving of the food. There are two types of cholesterol – HDL, known as the “good” cholesterol and LDL, the “bad” cholesterol.Carbohydrates And SugarBecome aware of the composition of your food. High sugar will promote blood sugar instability. Identify the “Total Carbohydrates”. This number represents the total of all the different types of carbohydrates you consume from eating one serving of the food.FibreChoose foods with a higher fibre content, which will slow down carbohydrate absorption.Work out the “Fibre” content. This number tells you how many grams of dietary fibre is in one serving of the food. Dietary Fibre is the undigestable portion of plant food. In processed foods and packaged cereals, choose foods with a minimum of two to four grams of fibre per serving. There are a few cereals with six to eight grams per serving, even better, or better still go for natural cereals like ( millet or corn cereal-pap)ProteinView the “Protein” amount. This number tells you how much protein you obtain from consuming one serving of the food.Become aware of your protein sources. Did you get 15 to 30 percent in your diet today?SugarBe vigilant about the amount of “Sugar”. Some carbohydrates become sugar when digested in your body, so you may be consuming more sugar than what is on the label.Vitamins And MineralLook at the “Vitamins and Minerals”. The food may contain several vitamins, such as Vitamin A, B, C or E as well as minerals such as iron and calcium.SodiumSodium is also known as table salt and it is a hidden ingredient in many foods, especially processed food, such as canned foods and tomato sauces.See the “Percent Daily Value”. The asterisk (*) after this heading refers to the information at the bottom of the label, which states “% daily values are based on a 2,000-calorie diet”.Finally, don’t forget to look at the “Information at the Bottom of the Label”. This chart is based on a 2,000-calorie diet. This information must be on all food labels, although the chart that follows is not required on small packages if the label is too small.However, the information is dietary advice from public health experts for all Nigerians and is the same for all products. This is applicable also in many other countries.The label shows the upper and lower limits for each nutrient based on a 2,000-calorie diet. Let’s use the macaroni and beef example. One serving would provide 18% of the Daily Value of the possible 100% Daily Value for your total fat intake. That leaves 82% that you could consume from other sources for that day. If you ate two servings, you would consume 36% of your Daily Value for fat, leaving 64% to be consumed from other sources.According to WikiHow.Ensure you read every product label before you purchase the food. And if  you aren’t eating enough whole, natural stuff, shop first where you find foods closer to how God originally created them.Always make eating nutritiously  your first priority. Try to eat a healthful mix of foods, with a special emphasis on lots of fruits and vegetables, and balance your carbohydrates protein, and fat to meet your body’s specific needs. You can tell when you found the right blend-your body will respond with high energy.Not to forget that exercise is the miracle cure we’ve always had, but for too long we’ve neglected to take our recommended dose. Our health is now suffering as a consequence.Whatever your age, there’s strong scientific evidence that being physically active can help you lead a healthier and even happier life.People who do regular activity have a lower risk of many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and some cancers.Research shows that physical activity can also boost self-esteem, mood, sleep quality and energy, as well as reducing your risk of stress, depression, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.“If exercise were a pill, it would be one of the most cost-effective drugs ever invented,” says Dr Nick Cavill, a health promotion consultant.Remember, you build a completely new body every seven years, and it can only be as strong as the supplies you give it to work with. You really are what you eat! As you make decisions about how you will eat and live for a lifetime, remember that you can’t build a brick house out of straw, nor can you build a healthy body out of sugar.For Questions and answers, lets connect @ www.facebook.com/BodyConfidenceFitnessClub.Copyright © 2017.

The guidelines call for more prominent display of information regarding calorie count, serving size, added sugars, and other factors.Campbell recommended food firms use their packaging to “stay ahead of the game​” in the months before the guidelines are implemented. For example, companies can communicate with on-pack messaging about nutrition in general, and the proposed Nutrition Facts labelling in specific details.“Using label space to teach shoppers about nutrition is a good way to gain trust, but also to encourage consumers to return to products time after time,” she added.The USDA unveiled the proposed changes to the Nutrition Facts label, which has not changed substantially since the 1990s, in late February. The comment period on the suggested alterations is 90 days.

789	"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) on February 27 announced[1] the forthcoming publication of two proposed rules designed to overhaul Nutrition Facts labeling: “Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels”[2] and “Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed at One-Eating Occasion; Dual Column Labling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments.”[3] The proposals were published in the Federal Register on March 3, 2014.The Nutrition Facts label was first introduced more than 20 years ago through the implementation of the Nutrition and Education Labeling Act (NLEA) and, according to FDA, is in need of a complete makeover. FDA lists three main categories of changes in the rules: those based upon new understanding of nutrition science, those reflecting updated serving size requirements and package-specific requirements, and those implementing a refreshed design.[4] Through these changes, FDA aims to change food packaging to reflect advances in public health initiatives, including those on obesity, chronic diseases, and scientific information, which is reflected by the removal and addition of certain vitamins and minerals from the Nutrition Facts label.[5] FDA states that the goal of the revamping of the Nutrition Facts label is not to tell people what to eat, but rather to provide better information to consumers so they can make informed choices.[6] Further, FDA states that the benefits of this change outweigh the costs, estimating that the one-time labeling change will cost industry approximately $2.3 billion, while the cumulative benefits over 20 years will average between $21.1 to $31.4 billion.[7]In total, under the proposed rule, Vitamins A and C, “Calories from Fat,” and the footnote table that lists reference values for both 2,000- and 2,500-calorie diets would be removed from the Nutrition Facts panel.Vitamins A and C would no longer be required to be listed on the Nutrition Facts panel. FDA states that data shows that Vitamin A and C deficiencies are uncommon.[8] The Agency reached this conclusion after examining data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).[9] Rather than requiring Vitamins A and C to be displayed on the Nutrition Facts panel, FDA will permit manufacturers to list them if they so choose.FDA is also proposing to remove the listing of “Calories from Fat.” In the proposed rule, FDA states that “current science supports a view that the type of fat is more relevant than the overall total fat intake in increased risk of chronic diseases.”[10] Further, the Agency states that removal of “Calories from Fat” will not have an effect on consumers’ ability to determine a food’s “healthfulness.”The requirement for the footnote table that lists the reference values for certain nutrients for 2,000- and 2,500-calorie diets will also be removed. FDA will perform consumer research to determine whether this change will affect consumers’ understanding of the Nutrition Facts label.[11]Listings of “Added Sugars,” potassium, and Vitamin D would be new requirements under the proposed rule.“Total Carbs” would replace “Total Carbohydrates” to reflect the term commonly used and understood by consumers. “Sugars” would be listed under “Total Carbs,” and a new category, “Added Sugars,” would appear indented under the “Sugars” listing. FDA states that, on average, American consumers eat 16% of their daily calories from sugars that are added during food production.[12] Thus, the new listing of “Added Sugars” aims to raise consumer awareness about the extra sugars that appear in foods.Two more additions to the Nutrition Facts panel would be potassium and Vitamin D. FDA states that Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, especially for women and the elderly.[13] Potassium can lower blood pressure and prevent hypertension. FDA analyzed data from NHANES and determined that the average consumer was not consuming enough of these nutrients to protect against chronic diseases, and thus Potassium and Vitamin D would be added to the Nutrition Facts.[14]Under the proposed rule, the calorie count would be the most prominent feature of the label, allowing the reader to quickly and easily identify the calories per serving. The prominence of the serving size per container would also increase, as it would be the first information presented on the Nutrition Facts label. Further, to make the serving-size information more accessible to the average consumer, it would be listed in household measures such as “2/3 cup.”Finally, and significantly, the serving sizes would be changed to more accurately reflect what consumers customarily consume. FDA set the current reference values (Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, or RACCs) based on eating habits analyzed in studies conducted in 1977–1978 and 1987–1988.[15] Because people generally consume more now than they did when these studies were conducted, the RACCs would be updated to reflect this change. Serving sizes are based on RACCs, and thus manufacturers would need to adjust serving sizes. FDA proposed that some food products that were labeled as more than one serving be labeled as one serving because consumers typically eat or drink them in one sitting. FDA lists examples of these products, including a 24-ounce can of soda, a 10.5-ounce frozen entrée, a 19-ounce can of soup, and a pint of ice cream.[16]FDA also proposed an alternative visual format for the Nutrition Facts panel. The alternative format utilizes three headings to organize nutrient levels and help consumers access information. First, “Quick Facts” lists the amount of total carbs, fat, and protein. Second, “Avoid Too Much” points out nutrients, such as fat, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar, that should be consumed in moderation. Third, “Get Enough” lists fiber and various vitamins. FDA is requesting comments on how these alternative headings may improve consumers’ understanding of the nutritional value of a product.[17] While the proposal does not address Front-of-Pack labeling, the alternate format of the proposed Nutrition Facts panel may provide some hint of future directions with its use of “Avoid Too Much” and “Get Enough” language. FDA’s Front-of-Package Labeling Initiative has not seen significant movement since its announcement in 2009 by Dr. Hamburg.If finalized, the proposed rules would be applicable to all nonexempt food products that fall within FDA’s jurisdiction. Meat, poultry, and processed egg products regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service are not covered, but USDA has informally stated that it is contemplating similar action.The proposed rules will be open for public comment for 90 days. Any final rules will become effective 60 days after the date of publication. Manufacturers will have two years to be in compliance after the final effective date.[1].

High 44F. Winds SW at 5 to 10 mph..Clear skies. Low 27F. Winds light and variable. Updated: January 25, 2018 @ 2:15 pmCan it be as easy as calories in, calories out?Probably so. And when it comes to counting calories, overweight Americans are put at a disadvantage by confusing, sometimes intentionally misleading, labels on food packaging.The Food and Drug Administration’s proposed revisions of the rules that govern the little nutrition facts panels found on packaged foods at the grocery store can’t happen fast enough. The changes would make it easier for consumers to make smarter choices.That would make for smart public policy because of the positive impact it could have on people’s health, which would bend the curve down on health care spending projections that show costs soaring as the population ages.The recent good news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — that the rate of obesity among the nation’s preschoolers fell nearly 6 percentage points between 2003-04 and 2011-12 — was offset by data showing the obesity rates for older adults, and older women in particular, had gone up over the same period.The CDC’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey did not include data on factors that might have affected the trends. But researchers speculate that better nutrition and physical activity standards at child care centers might be showing up in the improved numbers.CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden noted that the report follows previous CDC data showing “a significant decline in obesity prevalence among low-income children — ages 2 to 4 — participating in federal nutrition programs. … This confirms that at least for kids, we can turn the tide and begin to reverse the obesity epidemic.”Adults choose for themselves what they bring home to put on the table. To make better choices for themselves and their families, they need good nutritional information, clearly presented and easy to digest.Among sensible changes the FDA proposes are rules to post calorie counts prominently and to give them for more realistic serving sizes. That would mean no more reassuring claim that a serving of vanilla ice cream is 145 calories – but only if you serve yourself a half a cup.The proposed rules would double the standard serving for ice cream to a full cup — and even that stretches credulity.The FDA also wants manufacturers to list “added sugars” to the nutrition panel, good information for people trying to cut calories. The U.S. Department of Agriculture advises that while naturally occurring sugars usually have some nutritional value, added sugars do not. Yet the latter accounted for an average 16 percent of total calories in U.S. diets, according to the USDA’s 2010 dietary guidelines.Consumers can’t hope to get the real skinny on the packaged foods they eat for several years. Manufacturers have 90 days to comment. Then the FDA will need maybe a year to review and perhaps modify its proposals, and the industry another couple of years to make changes.If they come, expect better products. As former FDA Commissioner David Kessler, an early advocate of food labeling, observed in The Washington Post: “No one wants their products to look bad on the labels.”The Roanoke Times"	Health

794	Shaw Media recently posted an article about proposed changes to Nutrition Facts food labels. The proposed changes are only recommendations at this point, and would take a few years to fully implement.Recommended changes include:- Larger print for calories and serving sizes- Realistic serving sizes- Added sugar content- Sections defining what to avoid and what to get more ofWhat I have found over the years is that label reading is difficult for most people. Many do not know what they should be looking at or how much of each nutritional component is good or bad. This label would make it a bit easier for everyone to figure out on their own.I like these proposed changes. Different people may look at different info on the food label (i.e. Fat content, carbs, sugar, etc.), but these proposed changes really highlight the most important info that pertains to everybody — calories and serving size.Proposed label changes also make info easier to use by helping people to understand what they need to limit and what they want to get more of.  Current food labels are very “busy” and contain a lot of info that the average person doesn’t need. The proposed label changes simplify the info and get rid of all that extra stuff that most people never look at anyway.We don’t have to force people to make healthy food choices, but we can encourage them to educate themselves on their options, and to make the right choice accordingly. The easier these labels are to use, the more likely people will be to use them. The more people use food labels, the more we can improve the overall health of our nation through Real Nutrition.Find more nutrition tips from Kate Olson on her website: RealNutritionbyKate.com.

797	"The Food and Drug Administration has proposed changes for nutrition fact labels to help educate the public on healthy eating habits and prevent obesity.The Food and Drug Administration has proposed changes for nutrition fact labels to help educate the public on healthy eating habits and prevent obesity.The Food and Drug Administration has proposed changes for nutrition fact labels on food products to help educate the public on health-related habits and America’s fight against obesity.The first thing that may pop out to consumers on the proposed label is the calorie count, as well as servings per container. The plans propose them to be in a larger, bolded font. This is supposed to help the consumer become more aware of the portion size of a given product.Lisa Nolting, program coordinator forIowa State Dining Services, said she thinks the newly proposed nutrition labels will have both pros and cons.“Calories are more visible, and the label is easier to read, in my opinion,” Nolting said. “But it may take some education for the public to be able to understand the new label.""Students are some of these consumers. It is a matter of whether or not they will follow through with changing their portion intake.“It would be an interesting research project,” Nolting said.Ruth Litchfield, associate professor of food science and human nutrition, said she believes there will also be a reaction on the changed nutrition labels including the calories being displayed in a larger, bolder font.“The number of calories per serving is quite prominent,” Litchfield said. “The Dietary Guidelines for Americans identifies four nutrients of concern for Americans: calcium, vitamin D, potassium and fiber.""The FDA has changed what nutrients will be displayed on the lower section of the nutrition facts panel, as well.Instead of vitamin A and vitamin C to be required on label counts, it is now optional. Vitamin D and potassium will take their places as the new requirement.“These are the nutrients most likely to be lacking in the American diet,” Litchfield said.Nolting also said she agrees that most Americans are not getting enough vitamin D and potassium in their daily diets.Attention will also be drawn to sugars in the new layout of the label. Under “sugars,” added sugars, like manufactured, non-natural sugars, will be receiving their own line on the label.“Some sugar is naturally occurring, such as that in fruit and even unflavored milk. It is confusing for consumers who don’t know the difference between added and natural sugar,” Nolting said.While some titles are being added or replaced, other titles are being removed.According to the FDA, “calories from fat” will also be taken off of the proposed labels. The types of fat like “total fat,” “saturated fat” and “trans fat” have more importance than the total of calories from fat itself.Since the proposed label has not yet been approved, the FDA is accepting comments and revisions for up to 90 days.The percentage of daily values will be moving to the left side of the label, too. The FDA hopes this shift will help better inform the public on what is appropriate for nutritional totals each day.ISU students can become more aware of the percentage of their 'daily values' from the Department of Agriculture, too.“[The USDA] has nutrition information and education available at http://www.choosemyplate.gov,” Nolting said.MyPlate can raise awareness about eating healthfully by informing visitors about the five food groups, along with visuals and illustrations.

799	"The FDA caused quite a stir recently by announcing proposed updates to the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts information required for packaged foods and dietary supplements. These changes reflect the first significant changes in the 20 years since nutrition information was first required to be placed on labels in the form of a Nutrition Facts panel or Supplement Facts panel (changes to include trans fats information were initiated in 2006.) First Lady Michelle Obama and FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D. both trumpeted the updates as important changes that will allow consumers to make healthier food choices.While compliance with regulatory requirements for labeling is always a consideration for companies, class action litigation over labeling issues has become an equal, if not greater, concern for food, beverage, and dietary supplement companies. Consumer activist groups and plaintiff lawyers have increased their focus and attention on labeling claims like “all natural,” to more technical labeling issues such as the names of ingredients and nutrient content claims like “high in calcium.” Accordingly, the process regarding these proposed labeling changes will most assuredly be monitored with great interest, not only by regulatory attorneys and industry companies, but by public interest groups, class action lawyers, and consumers alike.A side-by-side comparison of the current format for a proper Nutrition Facts panel, in contrast with the proposed Nutrition Facts panel format, is provided below. (While the Supplement Facts panel will also undergo some changes, the proposed changes do not appear to be nearly as dramatic).
	The proposed changes come in the form of two proposed rules. One rule consists of revisions to the language in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 regarding Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts panels, respectively. The other rule will modify the current regulation found at 21 CFR 101.12 regarding the “Recommended Amounts Customarily Consumed” or “RACCs.” Both proposed rules will be open for public comment for an initial ninety-day period from the date of publication, intended for Monday, March 3, 2014. The rules implementing changes, if finalized, will not go into effect until two years after the effective date of the regulations

800	A history of gestational diabetes mellitus increases women’s risks of developing early atherosclerosis. This is what states a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. During a 20‐year period, researchers studied 898 women, between 18 and 30 years old. They assessed them for risk factors for heart disease before pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually disappears after pregnancy so they were periodically tested for metabolic conditions and diabetes mellitus before and after gestation. Authors measured the participants' carotid artery because this arterial wall thickness is an early measure of atherosclerosis and predicts heart attack and stroke in women. Researchers found that an history of GDM may be a marker for early atherosclerosis independent of pre‐pregnancy obesity among women who have not developed type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.A history of gestational diabetes mellitus increases women’s risks of developing early atherosclerosis. This is what states a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

802	"Women with gestational diabetes – a form of diabetes that occurs only during pregnancy and then typically disappears – may have an increased risk of developing heart disease later in life, Counsel and Heal reported.In a 20-year study, researchers analyzed data from 898 women between the ages of 18 to 30. Before becoming pregnant, each woman was assessed in order to determine her risk of developing heart disease later in life.Then, as the women began to have children, they were reassessed and tested for diabetes and other metabolic conditions. An average of 12 years after giving birth, the thickness of each woman’s carotid artery wall was also measured.The study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, revealed that women with a history of gestational diabetes went on to develop thicker carotid arteries, compared to women who never had gestational diabetes.""This finding indicates that a history of gestational diabetes may influence development of early atherosclerosis before the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases that previously have been linked to heart disease,"" said study author Erica P.

803	Utah People's PostThe Latest News from the Beehive StateMarch 13, 2014 Posted by Contributor Researchers from California have found that women who have a history of gestational disorders are at high risk of developing heart diseases in comparison to those who don’t suffer such gestational disorders.According to Erica P. Gunderson, senior scientist in the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, California, women who experienced gestational disorders may be at higher risk of developing atherosclerosis before development of Type2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. He also says pregnant women with background of gestational disorders are at higher risk of developing heart diseases in later stage of their lives.Experts say, gestational disorders usually disappear after pregnancy, but increase risks of heart diseases in later age.For the study, the researchers measured thickness of the artery walls of participants on an average of 12 years after pregnancy. They found 0.023 mm thicker elevated size of carotid artery wall in participants who experienced gestational diabetes and who did not develop diabetes or metabolic syndrome. About 13% of women also developed gestational diabetes.The study was published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.Filed Under: Health Tagged With: Gestation disorders, Gestation disorders in women, heart diseaseJanuary 25, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 23, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 22, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 21, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 20, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 19, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 18, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 17, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 16, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 15, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 14, 2018 By Amelia Donovan Copyright © 2018 utahpeoplespost.comAbout · Privacy Policy · Terms of Use · Site Map · Contact	Health
804	"Kaiser Permanente researchers in the U. S. have come up with a new finding suggesting that women with gestational diabetes are more prone to heart disease during old age. These women are equally at the risk of getting heart disease even if they don't have diabetes after pregnancy.Gestational diabetes is often detected in women during pregnancy and most of the times, it disappears after the delivery. For many women, the blood sugar levels increases during pregnancy.To reach this conclusion, researchers took observation of 898 women ageing between 18 and 30 years before their first pregnancy. The researchers assessed the risk factors pertaining to heart disease for these women. The researchers observed these women for following 20 years, during this period these women gave one or more births.It was found that a total of 13% women from 898, suffered from gestational diabetes during pregnancy.The researchers then with the help of ultrasound technique took measurement of carotid artery wall thickness of these women 12 years after pregnancy period. The researchers found that carotid artery wall thickness of the women, who had developed gestational diabetes, was much larger than those, who were not detected with the disease.

805	Women who experience gestational diabetes may face an increased risk of early heart disease later in life, even if they do not develop type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome subsequent to their pregnancy, according to a Kaiser Permanente study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.“Our research shows that just having a history of gestational diabetes elevates a woman’s risk of developing early atherosclerosis before she develops type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome,” says Erica Gunderson, study lead author and senior research scientist in the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, Calif. “Pregnancy has been under-recognized as an important time period that can signal a woman’s greater risk for future heart disease. This signal is revealed by gestational diabetes.”Gestational diabetes, a condition of elevated blood sugar during pregnancy, usually disappears after the pregnancy. It is managed with meal planning, activity and sometimes insulin or other medications.In the 20-year study, researchers assessed risk factors for heart disease before pregnancy among 898 women, 18 to 30 years old, who later had one or more births. The women were periodically tested for diabetes and metabolic conditions before and after their pregnancies. Using ultrasound, researchers measured the thickness of the walls of participants’ carotid artery, which circulates blood to the neck and face. Carotid artery wall thickness is an early measure of atherosclerosis — plaque build-up in arteries — and predicts heart attack and stroke in women. The artery’s thickness was measured on average 12 years after pregnancy.Researchers found a larger average carotid artery wall thickness in study participants with a history of gestational diabetes who did not develop diabetes or metabolic syndrome during the 20-year follow-up compared to those who never experienced gestational diabetes. The difference was not attributed to obesity or other risk factors for heart disease that were measured before pregnancy.It’s important to recognize reproductive characteristics that may contribute to disease risk in women, Gunderson says. “It’s a shift in thinking about how to identify a subgroup at risk for atherosclerosis early. The concept that reproductive complications unmask future disease risk is a more recent focus. It may inform early prevention efforts.”This study is part of Kaiser Permanente’s ongoing efforts to better understand gestational diabetes. Last year, Kaiser Permanente researchers found that pre-pregnancy obesity and older maternal age are among the risk factors for delayed lactation for women with gestational diabetes.View the discussion thread.© Copyright 2018 Advantage Business Media	Health

808	A 20-year study by researchers from California has found that women with history of gestational disorders are more likely to heart diseases compared to those women without gestational disorders. Erica P. Gunderson, senior scientist in the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, California said women who experienced gestational disorders are at increased risk of atherosclerosis before development of Type2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Gunderson added that pregnant women with background of gestational disorders are at higher risk of developing future heart diseases.The interesting fact is that gestational disorders usually disappear after pregnancy, but increase risks of heart diseases in later age. The research team has suggested eating proper diet or medications prescribed. Researchers measured thickness of the artery walls of participants on an average of 12 years after pregnancy. They found 0.023 mm thicker elevated size of carotid artery wall in participants who experienced gestational diabetes and who did not develop diabetes or metabolic syndrome.Researchers also found that about 13% of women developed gestational diabetes. Some other factors have also been analyzed by researchers which they believe might have influenced the thickness of the women in the study's arteries like obesity and high glucose levels before pregnancy.

Pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes may be more at risk of developing heart disease later in life, according to new research.


Researchers at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland have published the results of their 20-year study in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Gestational diabetes only occurs during pregnancy. It happens when hormones activated during pregnancy weaken the effect of insulin, the hormone that normally allows cells to absorb glucose from the blood.

Factors that can make pregnant women at greater risk of getting gestational diabetes include having a family history of diabetes, having previously had an unexplained miscarriage, being older than 25 when they became pregnant or being overweight before becoming pregnant.

Women who develop gestational diabetes are usually able to control their blood sugar without harming their baby's health. But having gestational diabetes does make women more likely to develop diabetes 5-10 years after giving birth.

The new study finds that women who get gestational diabetes while pregnant also have an associated risk of atherosclerosis - where the arteries around the heart become clogged by fatty substances. Because atherosclerosis disrupts the flow of blood to and from the heart, this can eventually cause heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases.

In the study, 898 women aged between 18 and 30, who later had children, were assessed for heart disease risk factors. Over a period of 20 years, the women were periodically tested for diabetes and other metabolic conditions. An average of 12 years after giving birth, the thickness of the walls of their carotid arteries was also measured using ultrasound.


Overall, 13% of the women in the study developed gestational diabetes. On average, the carotid artery walls of these women was 0.023 mm thicker than those of women who did not have gestational diabetes while they were pregnant.


The thickness of carotid arteries is used by doctors to measure atherosclerosis and predict heart attack and stroke.
The researchers also took into account other factors that might have influenced the thickness of the women in the study's arteries, such as whether the women were obese, or if they had high glucose levels before pregnancy.

""This finding indicates that a history of gestational diabetes may influence development of early atherosclerosis before the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases that previously have been linked to heart disease,"" says study lead author Erica P. Gunderson, PhD. ""Gestational diabetes may be an early risk factor for heart disease in women.""


""It's a shift in thinking about how to identify a subgroup at risk for atherosclerosis early,"" she added. ""The concept that reproductive complications unmask future disease risk is a more recent focus.""


In November 2013, Medical News Today reported on new screening guidelines to help medical professionals better detect gestational diabetes.

811	Your heart is your body’s engine, and it deserves to be taken care of. Many people don’t realize that they are not living a healthy heart life.  Learning the risks of heart disease can help you be your own heart health advocate.  Most heart and blood vessel problems develop over time and occur when arteries develop atherosclerosis, the gradual buildup of plaque inside the arteries.   If left unchecked, significant plaque buildup can lead to reduced blood flow through the arteries and eventually to blood clots that occur when plaques rupture. Ultimately, it is the effect of clots on the flow of blood to the heart or brain that can lead to a heart attack or stroke. A number of risk factors, from hereditary genetic conditions (non-modifiable) to entirely controllable habits (modifiable) like smoking and a poor diet, contribute to the onset of heart disease. High cholesterol, high blood pressure, limited physical activity, obesity, diabetes and tobacco use are all risk factors for heart disease. Through a combination of treatments and healthy lifestyle choices, the risk of heart disease and stroke can be significantly decreased. Risk factors An estimated 17.1 million people die of cardiovascular diseases every year, according to the World Heart Federation. There are many risk factors that contribute to the development of heart disease. It is important to know that some risk factors, called “non-modifiable risk factors,” cannot be changed, but some risk factors, called “modifiable risk factors,” can be controlled or treated. The more risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing heart disease. And higher levels of each risk factor correlate with a higher risk for heart disease.  Modifiable risk factors Hypertension is the single biggest risk factor for stroke. It also plays a significant role in heart attacks. It can be prevented and successfully treated, but only if you have it diagnosed and stick to your recommended management plan.  Abnormal blood lipid levels, that is high total cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, high levels of low-density lipoprotein or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol all increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Changing to a healthy diet, exercise and medication can modify your blood lipid profile.  Tobacco use, whether it is smoking or chewing tobacco, increases risks of heart disease. The risk is especially high if you started smoking when young, smoke heavily or are a woman. Stopping tobacco use can reduce your risk of heart disease significantly, no matter how long you have smoked. Non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke increase their risk of heart disease as well. Physical inactivity increases the risk of heart disease and stroke by 50 percent. People who don’t exercise regularly are 1.5 times more likely to develop heart disease. That’s why exercise is such an important part of a heart healthy lifestyle.  Obesity or being overweight, especially if a lot of weight is located in your waist area, increases your risk for health problems, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, high triglycerides, diabetes, heart disease and stroke.  Type II diabetes is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. Having diabetes makes you twice as likely as someone who does not, to develop heart disease. If you do not control diabetes then you are more likely to develop heart disease at an earlier age than other people, and it will be more devastating.  If you are a pre-menopausal woman, your diabetes cancels out the protective effect of estrogen and your risk of heart disease rises significantly.  What can you do you improve your heart health? Know the risk factors, and be sure to talk to you doctor about the ones that apply to you. Take action to change your lifestyle, and work to prevent your modifiable risk factors from compromising your heart health. Dr. Andrew Boyle is a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Florida. 	Health

814	Doctors have known for some time that women who develop pregnancy-related diabetes—known as gestational diabetes—are far more likely to get full-blown Type 2 diabetes years down the road than women who don’t develop the condition when pregnant. But new research suggests that the 2 to 10 percent of pregnant women who get gestational diabetes may also be at a higher risk of getting heart disease decades before those who don’t, which could potentially shorten their lifespan.In the study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers followed nearly 900 healthy young women for 20 years and found that those who previously had gestational diabetes were more likely to have thickened arteries on an imaging test —an early sign of heart disease—by the time they reached their late 30s to late 40s compared to those who never had the condition.Women typically develop heart disease in their 60s, about a decade later than men, due to female hormones that protect them through menopause.“We found evidence of early heart disease in those who had gestational diabetes even if they weren’t obese or didn’t have Type 2 diabetes,” said study leader Erica Gunderson, a senior research scientist at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland, Calif. This is the first time researchers found that gestational diabetes is an independent risk factor for heart disease, she added, that could predict future heart attack or stroke risk.It’s possible that the diabetes, which usually disappears after childbirth, is an early warning sign for future heart problems, but the condition itself might also cause subtle changes in certain hormonal systems, which leads to earlier heart disease.  Regardless of the scientific explanation, Gunderson said doctors should ask women if they’ve ever had pregnancy-related diabetes and should consider closer heart disease monitoring in those who answer yes. Regular blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol screenings are key. Women can also lower their heart disease risk by getting professional help to maintain a healthy weight and active lifestyle. (Most of those who had gestational diabetes are severely overweight.)While the American Heart Association and other medical groups do not recommend imaging tests to measure artery thickness in women with a history of gestational diabetes, Gunderson said some doctors may want to consider the ultrasound test—called carotid intima media thickness—which is not invasive and fairly routine. © 2018 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC	Health

816	"20-year study compared thickness of neck arteriesBy Robert Preidt
HealthDay Reporter
WEDNESDAY, March 12, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes might be at increased risk for heart disease later in life, a long-term study suggests.Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy and typically goes away after pregnancy. It does, however, increase a woman's risk for type 2 diabetes in future years.The new study found that gestational diabetes might also increase a woman's risk of heart disease in midlife and before she develops diabetes or metabolic syndrome, a group of symptoms and conditions known to increase the chances of heart troubles.The study included nearly 900 women, aged 18 to 30, in the United States who had one or more pregnancies and were followed for 20 years. Of those women, 13 percent developed gestational diabetes.The thickness of the women's neck (carotid) arteries was checked an average of 12 years after pregnancy, when they were aged 38 to 50. Thickening of the neck arteries -- called atherosclerosis -- is an early sign of heart disease.Among women who did not develop diabetes or metabolic syndrome during the 20 years of follow-up, those who had gestational diabetes had greater thickness in their neck arteries than those who didn't have gestational diabetes.The study appeared March 12 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.""This finding indicates that a history of gestational diabetes may influence development of early atherosclerosis before the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases that previously have been linked to heart disease,"" lead author Erica Gunderson, a senior research scientist at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, said in a journal news release.""Gestational diabetes may be an early risk factor for heart disease in women,"" she said.The study found an association between pregnancy-related diabetes and heart disease risk.

Study Highlights: Embargoed for release at 3 p.m. CT/4 p.m. ET, Wednesday, March 12, 2014(NewMediaWire) - March 12, 2014 - DALLAS - Pregnant women may face an increased risk of early heart disease when they develop gestational diabetes, according to research in the Journal of the American Heart Association.Gestational diabetes, which develops only during pregnancy and usually disappears after the pregnancy, increases the risk that the mother will develop diabetes later. The condition is managed with meal planning, activity and sometimes insulin or other medications.In the 20-year study, researchers found that a history of gestational diabetes may be a risk factor for early atherosclerosis in women during midlife before the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases. “Our research shows that just having a history of gestational diabetes elevates a woman’s risk of developing early, sub-clinical atherosclerosis before she develops type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome,” said Erica P. Gunderson, Ph.D., M.S., M.P.H., study lead author and senior research scientist in the Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland, Calif. “Pregnancy has been under-recognized as an important time period that can signal a woman’s greater risk for future heart disease. This signal is revealed by gestational diabetes, a condition of elevated blood sugar during pregnancy.”At the start of the study, researchers measured risk factors for heart disease before pregnancy among 898 women, 18 to 30 years old, who later had one or more births. The women were periodically tested for diabetes and metabolic conditions before and after their pregnancies throughout the 20-year period. Carotid artery wall thickness was measured on average 12 years after pregnancy when women were 38 to 50 years old. The study controlled for age, race, number of births and pre-pregnancy body mass index, and fasting blood glucose, insulin, lipids, and blood pressure.Participants were divided into women who developed gestational diabetes and those who didn’t. Overall, 119 women (13 percent) reported they had developed gestational diabetes (7.6 per 100 deliveries).Carotid artery media thickness is an early measure of sub-clinical atherosclerosis and predicts heart attack and stroke in women. Researchers used ultrasound studies to image the carotid artery, with four measurements from the near and far wall thickness.Among the women who did not go on to develop diabetes or the metabolic syndrome during the 20- year follow up, they found a 0.023 mm larger average carotid artery intima-media thickness in those who had gestational diabetes compared to those who didn’t, and the difference was not attributed to obesity or elevated glucose before pregnancy.“This finding indicates that a history of gestational diabetes may influence development of early atherosclerosis before the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases that previously have been linked to heart disease,” Gunderson said. “Gestational diabetes may be an early risk factor for heart disease in women.”At the study’s close, 13 women experienced cardiovascular events, one of them in the gestational diabetes group.Participants were part of the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults), a longitudinal analysis of women without previous heart disease or diabetes before pregnancies. Women participating in the CARDIA study came from four urban areas: Birmingham, Ala., Chicago, Ill., Minneapolis, Minn., and Oakland, Calif.It’s important to recognize reproductive characteristics that may contribute to disease risk in women and may inform early prevention efforts, Gunderson said.“It’s a shift in thinking about how to identify a subgroup at risk for atherosclerosis early,” she said. “The concept that reproductive complications unmask future disease risk is a more recent focus.”Gunderson plans to continue following this line of research and investigating other risk factors involving pregnant women and disease. At present, there are no uniform national recommendations for screening for heart disease risk factors in pregnancy to determine risk of later heart disease.Co-authors are Vicky Chiang, M.S.P.H.; Mark J.

818	"OAKLAND, Calif. — Women who experience gestational diabetes may face an increased risk of early heart disease later in life, even if they do not develop type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome subsequent to their pregnancy, according to a Kaiser Permanente study published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association. ""Our research shows that just having a history of gestational diabetes elevates a woman's risk of developing early atherosclerosis before she develops type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome,"" said Erica P. Gunderson, PhD, MPH, study lead author and senior research scientist in the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, Calif. ""Pregnancy has been under-recognized as an important time period that can signal a woman's greater risk for future heart disease. This signal is revealed by gestational diabetes.""Gestational diabetes, a condition of elevated blood sugar during pregnancy, usually disappears after the pregnancy. It is managed with meal planning, activity and sometimes insulin or other medications.In the 20-year study, researchers assessed risk factors for heart disease before pregnancy among 898 women, 18 to 30 years old, who later had one or more births. The women were periodically tested for diabetes and metabolic conditions before and after their pregnancies. Using ultrasound, researchers measured the thickness of the walls of participants' carotid artery, which circulates blood to the neck and face. Carotid artery wall thickness is an early measure of atherosclerosis — plaque build-up in arteries — and predicts heart attack and stroke in women. The artery's thickness was measured on average 12 years after pregnancy.Researchers found a larger average carotid artery wall thickness in study participants with a history of gestational diabetes who did not develop diabetes or metabolic syndrome during the 20-year follow-up compared to those who never experienced gestational diabetes.. The difference was not attributed to obesity or other risk factors for heart disease that were measured before pregnancy.It's important to recognize reproductive characteristics that may contribute to disease risk in women, Gunderson said. ""It's a shift in thinking about how to identify a subgroup at risk for atherosclerosis early. The concept that reproductive complications unmask future disease risk is a more recent focus. It may inform early prevention efforts."" This study is part of Kaiser Permanente's ongoing efforts to better understand gestational diabetes. Last year, Kaiser Permanente researchers found that pre-pregnancy obesity and older maternal age are among the risk factors for delayed lactation for women with gestational diabetes.Kaiser Permanente can conduct transformational health research in part because it has the largest private patient-centered electronic health system in the world. The organization's electronic health record system, Kaiser Permanente HealthConnect®, securely connects 9.1 million patients to more than 16,000 physicians in almost 600 medical offices and 38 hospitals.

For this 20-year study, researchers analyzed data on 898 female participants between the ages of 18 and 30 taken from the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults). At the beginning of the study, when the participants were not pregnant, the researchers assessed the women's risk for heart disease. Throughout the study, when the women had at least one birth, they were periodically tested for diabetes and other metabolic conditions. The researchers specifically assessed carotid artery wall thickness an average of 12 years after pregnancy.After controlling for number of births, age, race, pre-pregnancy body-mass-index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, insulin, lipids and blood pressure, the researchers found that a history of gestational diabetes could be tied to a thicker carotid artery intima-media. 119 women, who made up 13 percent of the sample, had gestational diabetes. These women had carotid artery intima-media thickness that was on average 0.023 mm larger than women without gestational diabetes. The researchers concluded that the thickness was not caused by obesity. At the end of the study, a total of 13 women suffered from some kind of cardiovascular event. Only one of them was from the gestational diabetes group.""This finding indicates that a history of gestational diabetes may influence development of early atherosclerosis before the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases that previously have been linked to heart disease,"" Gunderson said.

Gunderson, a senior researcher at the Division of Research at the Kaiser Permanente in California and lead author of the study, said in a press release that the findings illuminate new consequences of the metabolic disorder that only occurs during pregnancy. ""Our research shows that just having a history of gestational diabetes elevates a woman's risk of developing early, sub-clinical atherosclerosis before she develops type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome,"" she explained.""Pregnancy has been under-recognized as an important time period that can signal a woman's greater risk for future heart disease,” she added. “This signal is revealed by gestational diabetes, a condition of elevated blood sugar during pregnancy.""The study, which is published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, surveyed 898 mothers ages 18 to 30 over a 20-year period.

822	Canadians will soon need to pay more to watch series and movies on Netflix. The company has raised the price of its plans for both new and existing users. While the rise has been already implemented for new subscribers, existing users will be notified through email before new rates are charged from them.In a statement released by Netflix, the company cited addition of new content and introduction of new features and services as the reasons behind the price rise. It said that Netflix adjusts the pricing of its packages from time to time as they introduce new movies, exclusive TV series and upgrade their platform to offer better services to its customers.The company has a huge database of content and also produces its own original content which has become popular like House of Cards. It also has a large number of movies sourced exclusively from international film festivals. Few of USA TV shows are also aired by Netflix in Canada like CW’s Riverdale and ABC’s Scandal.Netflix has a growing market in Canada and in 2016 it had around 5.2 million subscriptions. The television streaming market is quite competitive in Canada and many leading names are fighting out with each other.Brands like Amazon prime are quite a hit in the country having Canadian airing rights of highly rated shows such as American Gods and Mr. Robot. CBS All Access is also set to enter the Canadian market sometime in 2018 with its 9,000 episodes from various shows. The multiple numbers of competitors and the fight to acquire rights for shows has increased the acquisition cost of the content. Though Netflix did not mention it in their statement, still it is a situation faced by all companies in Canadian television industry.Netflix increased their prices last year in May while introducing the feature of streaming in high quality on multiple devices. This time the increase has been $1 for the basic plan making it $8.99 per month. Users can only stream standard quality videos on a single device at a time. The cost of the standard plan has also gone up by $1 ($10.99 per month) which permits subscribers to access content on two screens. Subscribers of the premium plan now have to shell out a monthly $13.99, which is a $2 increase from the previous price. Users can view high definition 4k videos simultaneously on four screens with this plan.The company changes its prices based on local market conditions in a country. The Australian subscribers had to pay few dollars more after Netflix raised the prices in June countering the increase in local taxes. It remains to be seen how the users will respond to the move.TV streaming service in Canada will get a major boost next year with the introduction of CBS Corp’s CBS All Access service. It is the company’s bid to go international that prompted the move and gave Canada the first opportunity to enjoy its content.The online streaming service in the US has a huge database of content and around 9,000 episodes from its various series. Viewers will also get access to special CBS channels like Showtime without requiring a cable connection. Apart from television activities, those who fond of games playing can try out one of the secure Canadian source NBSO online casino games list website. It is free and has a high level of reliability (si vous parlez français, essayez de choisir des jeux sur le site web du guide spécial casino en ligne, qui est fiable et gratuit).CBS corp. has a good chance of creating a considerable grab on the market but it lacks on one ground. The copyrights of many of its shows are already purchased by Canadian broadcasters like Rogers Communications Inc., BCE Inc. and Corus Entertainment Inc. So viewers will not get to see shows like Survivor or The Big Bang Theory and some of the shows are also aired on Netflix. The restricted content may impact the number of subscribers the company is expecting.We have to wait and see as CBS predicts they are going to have 4 million subscriptions by the end of this year. It is interesting to note that TV viewership is declining in Canada and online streaming services are giving a tough competition to the traditional form. In 2016, the volume of subscribers reduced by 1% and reached 11.1 billion viewers and the revenue fell by 2% amounting to $8.7 billion, according to the data from Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.On the other hand, online streaming services have gained increased number of subscriptions. Netflix recorded a growth of 52 million viewers in US alone and another 52 million from all over the world. Compared to that, 158,000 people in Canada disconnected their cable service in 2015. It can be expected that the market is ripe for online streaming in Canada and other players like Hulu and HBO Go may join the competition in some years.With so many providers in the game, the price is also a big factor in getting subscriptions. CBS did not reveal the rates they will charge in Canada, but in the US current rates are $5.99 per month. To get a commercial free version, viewers have to pay $9.99. If the rates are any higher, then Canadian may not be too interested in joining up considering the limitation of content.Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS said that they were aware of the potential of online streaming judging the success of their competitors. The introduction of the service in Canada gives them the chance to directly reach the viewer on an increased scale which can be expanded globally. CBS All Access had achieved a growing domestic market and now is ready with their premium content to hit the international arena.Auto insurance provider Intact Insurance in Nova Scotia plan to use mobile apps to track driver habits to determine the premium rates in the future. Based on the way one drives, they can be eligible for a 25% savings on their insurance premium!The idea may sound out of a science fiction movie but the concept has existed for some time. Many companies like Intact Insurance offer a plug in dongles for vehicles which are used to track driver habits. Intact insurance revealed that the dongle program included 350,000 participants from all over the country. It was introduced at N.S in 2014.However, they are not always the practical solution due to various reasons.First is the cost that prohibits their universal use and in some cases, the devices are not returned to the company. They can also be lost adding to the cost of the company. Another reason is the dongles track the habits of any driver that gets behind the wheel and it is not possible to distinguish between them.Mobile apps have many unique advantages that make them a pragmatic solution for the insurance companies. The app would be using the smart phone of the driver and eliminate any expense on part of the insurance provider. They will also be able to specifically track the habits of the insurance payer which is their priority. It will only monitor the main driver as the app will be linked to his mobile phone.The tool will be used to track aspects of sudden accelerations, hard braking, night driving utilizing the GPS feature of the phones. Intact Insurance applied for permission to launch the program from the N.S Utility and Review Board which was granted on August 4. The company plans to launch the service next month starting September. The initiative will be a way to reward drivers with good habits and give them lower insurance rates for their performance.For the time being, the app or the dongle insurance rates are optional in Canada. But according to experts, a day may come when it automatically becomes more preferable considering the costs. With the advance of technology, the companies may increase the cost of the premium and people will opt for the tracking program for affordability.But not all customers may be willing to join the program. It has been seen that many consumers do not prefer to join such programs. Some also practice bad driving habits like speeding or other dangerous stunts which may impact the insurance rates. There are also some apprehensions about the nature of data collected by the app and its usage by the company. But as the insurance industry is regulated it has not misused the user data under its control.	Health
823	"A new vaginal gel has the potential to protect women from HIV, even if it is applied several hours after sex, animal research suggests.The antimicrobial gel protected five out of six monkeys from a hybrid simian/human AIDS virus when it was used three hours after exposure to the AIDS-causing virus, said lead author Walid Heneine, a researcher in HIV/AIDS prevention for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The same gel also protected two out of three monkeys when applied a half-hour before HIV exposure, according to the study, published March 12 in Science Translational Medicine. 
                                            University of Pennsylvania researchers have made a potential breakthrough in the fight against HIV. As Bigad Shaban explains, one patient seeking...
                                    ""If you're having sex that's in any way not anticipated, you might not have an opportunity to apply the microbicide before the sex happens,"" Johnston said. ""In the heat of the moment, you might not always have time to say 'Stop, put everything on hold while I put this product in.'""Don't expect the gel to be on the market anytime soon, however. Researchers are a few years away from human clinical trials, Heneine said, because they are working on improving the gel's effectiveness. And results of animal trials aren't necessarily replicated in humans.The gel contains a 1-percent solution of the anti-HIV drug raltegravir (Isentress), and works by blocking the ability of the virus to integrate its DNA into the DNA of animal cells.DNA integration is a crucial step in HIV infection but comes late in the infection process, typically more than six hours after exposure, the researchers found. Focusing preventive treatment on that specific step provides an hours-long window when people can take steps to protect themselves after exposure to HIV.""It's really a very interesting leap,"" Johnston said. ""If you do want something that would protect against HIV after exposure, then you want a drug that acts later on in the virus' life cycle.""Once the gel is applied, the HIV cannot transmit its DNA into cells, the researchers say.""The DNA degrades and the cell does not become affected,"" Heneine said. Raltegravir has ""been very effective in HIV treatment, and now we're looking at it in prevention,"" he added.In the United States, the AIDS virus is mainly spread by having unprotected sex (sex without a condom) with someone infected with HIV, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Researchers first tested the gel's effectiveness pre-contact, by applying it to three monkeys who were exposed to HIV twice a week for seven weeks. By the end, two of the three remained HIV-free, compared with just one out of 10 monkeys in a group that received an inactive placebo gel.The team then tested whether the gel could protect against HIV infection after exposure, using six monkeys exposed to HIV twice a week for two and a half months. By applying the gel three hours after exposure, researchers were able to protect five of the six monkeys from HIV infection. All four monkeys in the placebo group contracted HIV.Such a gel, once through its clinical trials and approved, could become as widely used as birth control devices such as condoms and spermicidal gels, Johnston said.""You can imagine this to be a useful product to have, if it were something you could buy over the counter and have at home just in case,"" she said.

A new study conducted on female monkeys reported that a particular type of gel applied to the vaginal area after sexual intercourse protected the monkeys from the virus.The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA headed the experiment, which involved macaque monkeys. The monkeys were exposed to a hybrid simian/human AIDS virus. The researchers administered an antimicrobial gel three hours after being exposed to the virus.

""It's a promising after-sex vaginal gel to prevent HIV infection,"" Dr. Charles Dobard, of the division of HIV/Aids prevention, told BBC News. ""Studies still need to be done to look at the window [of opportunity] - is it six, eight, 24 hours?""""You can imagine this to be a useful product to have, if it were something you could buy over the counter and have at home just in case,"" Rowena Johnston, vice president of research for amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research said according to WebMD.The gel is made with a one percent solution of raltegravir, which is an anti-HIV drug. The drug works by inhibiting the virus's ability to integrate its DNA into the genetic makeup of animal cells. Based on several studies, researchers believe that DNA integration occurs after six hours of exposure. The gel was capable of stopping this process in animal models.""What we did in this work was we identified an anti-HIV drug that blocks virus integration in the DNA,"" lead author Walid Heneine, a researcher in HIV/AIDS prevention for the CDC said according to AFP. ""This is a prerequisite step for HIV infection, and that step takes at least six hours after infection so that provides a wide window for dosing after sex.""Despite the study's findings, the researchers stated that modifying the gel for human trials would most likely not occur for another few years. Previous human trials involving vaginal gels mixed with HIV medications have yielded very mixed outcomes.The study was published in the Science Translational Medicine.Tagsmonkey, vaginal gel, anti-HIV drug, HIV, sexual intercourse, ExposureYou have already subscribed.

825	"Senior faith leaders in New Orleans are partnering with the NAACP New Orleans Branch for an HIV training session. It is in an effort to teach African American faith leaders how to educate congregations on the impact of HIV in African American communities.There are an overwhelming amount of African Americans infected with HIV and AIDS nationally, and organizers believe if faith leaders lead the discussion on this issue it will have a greater impact on stopping the spread of the disease.According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, African Americans account for a higher proportion of people with new HIV infections in the United States. The rate of new HIV infection in blacks is eight times that of whites based on population size.In 2009, blacks make up just 12 percent of the U.S. population, but accounted for 44 percent of all people living with HIV. New Orleans and Baton Rouge rank third and second, respectively, in the nation for HIV case rates.Organizers of the training happening at the New Orleans Branch of NAACP Thursday morning said HIV in the black community has become more than a medical issue - it's an issue of social justice.Black churches are now standing up in the fight against HIV through a program called ""The Black Church and HIV: The Social Justice Imperative.""One of the program's goals is to train faith leaders in the 30 cities across the United States most impacted by HIV. The NAACP is leading the program, which gives pastors resources and educates them on how to start life-saving conversations about HIV.The training aims to enlist faith leaders as agents of change to address the impact of HIV and AIDS on African Americans. Organizers said eliminating HIV will take great effort, but they expect with the help of partners in the faith community the can facilitate honest dialogue with the estimated 20 million African Americans who attend church weekly.Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on purchases made through our links to retailer sites."

826	"ATLANTA, March 12 (UPI) --  Tests in monkeys show a gel containing an HIV drug stops the virus from infecting cells -- even if applied after sex, U.S. researchers say. Dr. Walid Heinene of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta tested a gel containing the human immunodeficiency virus drug raltegravir. The gel protected monkeys when given before they were infected with HIV vaginally, but it also prevented infection when applied as long as 3 hours after sex, NBC News reported.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
If the gel has a similar impact in humans, women would be able protect themselves from HIV infection after sexual intercourse, Heinene said. The HIV virus that causes AIDS can be transmitted in blood, semen and breast milk, but most people are infected sexually and in Africa, where most cases occur, 60 percent of HIV patients are women. Almost all were infected by husbands or other sexual partners, Heinene said.United Press International is a leading provider of news, photos and information to millions of readers around the globe via UPI.com and its licensing services.

827	"Here is a new vaginal gel to protect women from HIV even three hours after sex. There are various vaginal gels that contain antiretroviral drugs - indispensable for HIV prevention - but they all can only be applied before having sex. However, the gel developed by US researchers containing the human immunodeficiency virus drug raltegravir can be effective to prevent HIV infection to cells even three hours after sexual intercourse.	The gel has been tested successfully on monkeys so far, but researchers are optimistic that the gel will work effectively on women as well. The HIV virus can be transmitted through blood, semen and breast milk. However, most people get the virus during sexual interaction. Africa has the highest cases of AIDS in the world. Of all HIV cases in Africa, 60% are women, with majority of them getting the infection from their husband.	The US researchers behind the creation of the new gel are of the belief that their version is more practical because it will give more control to women and would require less preparation before sex and require less partner acceptance.	A macaque model was used by the researchers to assess efficacy and it was found that applying the gel 30 minutes before exposure prevented two of three macaques from SIHV, which is a combination of HIV and a related monkey virus. But the best part was that the gel was equally effective even three hours after SHIV exposure."	Health

          50View  commentsA gel that was found to reduce the rate of HIV infection among monkeys when administered after sex could possibly work on humans too, researchers have found.Scientists have found that monkeys can be protected against HIV infection with a vaginal gel, even when it is administered three hours after sex.The research, which was published in Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, tested a  new microbicidal vaginal gel on macaque monkeys. Macaque monkeys were treated with the new gel and five out of the six monkeys were protected from infection 12 monkeys were given vaginal washes of simian HIV to mimic sex with an infected monkey. Three hours later, six of these monkeys were treated with the newly-developed gel and the other six were given a placebo gel.Of the six macaques given the new gel, only one was infected with HIV, compared to all six of the monkeys who were treated with the placebo.If the gel works in humans, it could represent a breakthrough for preventing HIV infection, particularly for women who have been raped.Sharon L. Hillier, a professor of obstetrics at the University of Pittsburgh, told the New York Times that if the gel worked in humans, ‘it could be used for HIV prevention like Plan B or the morning-after pill for contraception’.The gel contains raltegravri, antiretroviral drug already in use for HIV treatment, and some HIV-prevention gels do exist, but they usually require a pre-exposure dose.Success in monkeys does not always predict success among humans, and testing such drugs on humans is complicated and raises serious ethical considerations.However, the results are encouraging and add to a sense of optimism in the field of HIV research. Two separate trials last week showed that monkeys who received injections of slow-release HIV drugs were protected from infection for weeks.In other research, two babies in the U.S. who were born infected with HIV appear to have been cured by large doses of drugs administered soon after birth.The study adds to other encouraging findings in the field of AIDS research in the last few weeks

If it works in humans, such a gel would be particularly useful in countries where women have little protection against domestic violence or rape, because they could apply it surreptitiously after a partner fell asleep or a clinic could administer it after a rape. But if the technique does move into human trials, scientists said, it is more likely that women would be asked to try to use it both before and after sex. The study, published yesterday in the journal Science Translational Medicine, did not show 100 percent protection. One of six macaques became infected despite the gel; all those who got a placebo gel became infected. The gel contains raltegravir, an anti-retroviral drug already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of HIV. Three hours before it was inserted, the monkeys were given vaginal washes of simian HIV to simulate sex with an infected monkey. In a separate part of the trial, only 1 of 3 monkeys given a similar gel 30 minutes before exposure to the virus became infected. Walid Heneine, the study’s lead author, said it was unclear why two monkeys in the two parts of the trial were infected. “We puzzled about those two, but we could never pinpoint an explanation,” he said. Heneine directs primate trials of HIV-prevention methods for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While emphasizing that success in monkeys does not always predict success in humans, AIDS experts were impressed by the results.

831	Utah People's PostThe Latest News from the Beehive StateMarch 13, 2014 Posted by Contributor In a discovery that could act as pathbreaking in the field of science, researchers have claimed to have developed a gel that they claim can protect from HIV infection even if applied after having sex.US researchers have developed a unique vaginal product that they call after-sex gel which promises women to provide protection from HIV infections.According to the researchers, the vaginal gel has antiretroviral drugs that plays significant role in the prevention from HIV infection.The product is developed by the researchers at US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and contains raltegravir, an anti-HIV drug. The description of the new vaginal gel product is published in the Science Translational Medicine paper.Researchers have tested the product successfully in monkey. While testing they found that applying it 30 minutes before the exposure protected two of three subjects from SHIV, which is the combination of HIV and related monkey virus. Much to the surprise for the researchers, the gel was found to be equally successful even after its application three hours after SHIV exposure. It resisted 20 virus challenges and also 10-week follow-up period.Even the success story is very impressive, the researchers say observations are still required to confirm the same success rate in larger numbers of animals. Filed Under: Health Tagged With: After sex gel, AIDS, HIV, HIV gel, HIV positive, HIV test, HIV/AIDS treatmentJanuary 25, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 23, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 22, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 21, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 20, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 19, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 18, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 17, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 16, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 15, 2018 By Amelia Donovan January 14, 2018 By Amelia Donovan Copyright © 2018 utahpeoplespost.comAbout · Privacy Policy · Terms of Use · Site Map · Contact	Health
832	London: Researchers have revealed that a new after-sex vagina gel can be used by women to protect themselves against HIV.According to scientists at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, drugs applied three hours after exposure to the virus could protect female monkeys from a type of HIV, the BBC reported.Researchers have said that this study would require large clinical trials to test any new treatment and that condoms still remain the best defense against HIV.Scientists found that the gel protected five out of six monkeys from an animal-human laboratory strain of HIV, when it was applied before or three hours after infection.Dr Charles Dobard, of the division of HIV/Aids prevention, said that the gel used is a promising after-sex vaginal gel to prevent HIV infection and studies still need to look for the window of opportunity.Dr Andrew Freedman, reader and consultant in infectious diseases at Cardiff University School of Medicine, said that the gel contained a different class of anti- HIV drug, which attacks the virus at a later stage in infection.The study is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.  	Health
833	"A vaginal gel can protect women against HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection, even three hours after the virus exposure.Interestingly, the antimicrobial gel, when applied either 30 minutes prior to the sex or three hours after the intercourse, succeeded prevention of simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in monkeys, Health Day reported. While applying the gel prior to the virus exposure protected two out of three macaques, administering the gel three hours after prevented infection in five out of the six animals tested.The gel mainly contains raltegravir (Isentress), an antiretroviral drug widely used to treat HIV infection.  HIV infection involves integration of the virus DNA into a person's DNA. Researchers led by Walid Heneine, from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the DNA integration occurs only six hours after HIV exposure. The gel, when applied during this period, stops HIV from transmitting its DNA into the human cells.""The DNA degrades and the cell does not become affected,"" Heneine told Health Day.For the study, researchers conducted experiments on 23 macaques. In the first stage, researchers exposed 13 monkeys to HIV twice a week for nearly two months. Three monkeys used the gel 30 minutes before the exposure, while the rest 10 received a placebo gel. Only one monkey in the first group contracted the deadly virus compared to nine in the placebo group.In the second experiment, six monkeys received the gel and four monkeys were given a placebo gel, nearly three hours after the virus exposure. Of the total, five monkeys- one from the gel group and four from the second group- contracted HIV.Experts welcomed the findings and said that the new gel can be of great use while being exposed to the virus unexpectedly. ""If you're having sex that's in any way not anticipated, you might not have an opportunity to apply the microbicide before the sex happens,"" J Rowena Johnston, vice president of research for amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, told Health Day. In the heat of the moment, you might not always have time to say, ""Stop, put everything on hold while I put this product in.""""You can imagine this to be a useful product to have, if it were something you could buy over the counter and have at home just in case,"" she added, later.The study has been published in the journal Science Translational Medicine."

834	"An experimental new HIV gel will reportedly protect women from AIDS, even after they've had sex, a new study finds.The gel has already been tested on monkeys and researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it protected female monkeys from getting AIDS, even if applied three hours after the infection enters the body. To measure the effectiveness of the gel, researchers applied it to three monkeys who were exposed to HIV twice a week for seven weeks. By the end, two of the three remained HIV-free, compared with just one out of 10 monkeys in a group that received an inactive placebo gel.To confirm its findings, the team then tested whether the gel could protect against HIV infection after exposure, using six monkeys exposed to HIV twice a week for two and a half months. By applying the gel three hours after exposure, researchers were able to protect five of the six monkeys from HIV infection. All four monkeys in the placebo group contracted HIV.The CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, confirmed that the gel is a ""proof of concept"" in an animal model.""It's a promising after-sex vaginal gel to prevent HIV infection,"" Dr Charles Dobard, of the division of HIV/Aids prevention, told BBC News. ""Studies still need to be done to look at the window [of opportunity] - is it six, eight, 24 hours?""As the gel has only been tested on monkeys now, researchers say that there is still a long way to go before the treatment can be used on humans. According to Jason Warriner, clinical director at the OTerrence Higgins Trust, no microbicide has yet been found that offers full protection against HIV. Hence, if the gel proves to be effective on humans, it will be ""another small step forward, particularly in countries where high HIV rates and cultural barriers to condom use have created the perfect storm"".""It's really a very interesting leap. If you do want something that would protect against HIV after exposure, then you want a drug that acts later on in the virus' life cycle,"" said Rowena Johnston, vice president of research for amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, according to WebMD.The gel contains a 1 percent solution of the anti-HIV drug raltegravir (Isentress), and works by blocking the ability of the virus to integrate its DNA into the DNA of animal cells. It is this DNA integration that leads to HIV infection. However, the infection doesn't take place as soon as the virus enters the body. It takes place typically more than six hours after exposure. Researchers suggested that this window can be used by people to protect themselves after exposure to HIV.If similar findings are observed in humans, the gel will be a new way for women to protect themselves from HIV infection after intercourse, according to NBC News. Until then, experts suggest large clinical trials would be needed to test any new treatment, and condoms remain the best defense.According to CDC statistics, 1.1 million Americans suffer from HIV/AIDS and among these, 15.8 percent are unaware of their infection. In the United States, the infection is mainly spread through unprotected sex. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) remain the population most profoundly affected by HIV.According to the latest WHO and UNAIDS global estimates, women comprise 50 percent of people living with HIV.The study was published in the Science Translational Medicine."

UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé also participated in the meeting that took place on 10th March 2014  at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.Welcoming his second meeting with the Special Envoys on HIV/AIDS since their appointment in 2012, the Secretary-General thanked them for their continued commitment and well-coordinated leadership and advocacy. Mr Ban said, “I commend you all for your excellent work in 2013 and am very pleased to learn that you are working closely with other Special Envoys, Special Representatives and Rapporteurs to advocate for and create synergies between your work. I am also happy to learn that you have worked closely with UNAIDS to develop specific strategic directions for 2014.” Mr Ban also welcomed the latest member of the team, Speciosa Wandira-Kazibwe.“They are a dedicated and cohesive team and have been instrumental in advancing efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals,” said Michel Sidibé Executive Director of UNAIDS. “They also greatly support the Secretary-General and his call for a life of dignity for all and leaving no one behind.”The Special Envoys on HIV/AIDS are formed by Speciosa Wandira-Kazibwe, Special Envoy for Africa; Michel Kazatchkine, Special Envoy for Eastern Europe and Central Asia; J.V.R. Prasada Rao, Special Envoy for Asia and the Pacific; and Edward Greene, Special Envoy for the Caribbean.“We have an effective team with great coherence, and a deep understanding of regional specificities and global issues, and are able to work across areas of development beyond HIV,” Mr Ban added.Their main areas of work are prioritizing to ensure the prominence of HIV in thematic areas are on drug policy, human rights, stigma and discrimination and the empowerment of women and girls.12 January 201825 October 201721 August 2017	Health
843	"In efforts to address the complex linkages between violence and HIV, the Executive Director of UNAIDS Michel Sidibé has called on governments and communities to take concerted action on ending violence against women. Mr Sidibé made the call at a high-level panel on HIV, Gender Equality, and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights organized by UNAIDS during the 58th Commission on the Status of Women held in New York.Mr Sidibé launched a UNAIDS Advocacy Brief: Unite with women unite against violence and HIV. The brief outlines five core reasons to prevent violence against women; violence against women is a human rights violation; women who experience violence are more likely to acquire HIV; women living with HIV are more likely to be subjected to violence; women most vulnerable to HIV are also most vulnerable to violence; and that violence undermines the HIV response by creating a barrier to accessing services.12 March 2014Studies have shown that intimate partner violence can increase the risk of HIV infection by around 50% and that one in three women experience violence by their intimate partner during their lifetime. There is also evidence that violence, or the fear of violence undermines access to treatment, care and support services for women living with HIV.In efforts to address the complex linkages between violence and HIV, in a statement, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the world to do more, “We must take action to end violence against women and girls and ensure that they have the sexual and reproductive health and rights that they deserve. Violence has a drastic impact on the health of women and children and is inextricably linked to a higher prevalence of HIV. That is why I have made ending violence against women and girls a top priority for the United Nations.”The Secretary-General’s call was amplified at the high-level panel Linking HIV, gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights as part of the Every Women Every Child initiative, and the post-2015 social justice agenda organized by UNAIDS during the 58th Commission on the Status of Women held in New York. “Not only is violence against women an extreme human rights violation, it also makes women more vulnerable to HIV infection,” said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “Post-2015 is the opportunity to ensure all women and girls reach their full potential, without the threat of violence, risk of HIV infection and violation of their sexual and reproductive rights.”The event, chaired jointly by Mr Sidibé and the Executive Director of UN Women Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, encouraged dialogue around the critical need for women-centred efforts to end the AIDS epidemic; the advancement of sexual and reproductive health and rights for women; gender equality and women’s empowerment; and zero tolerance for gender-based violence. “The single most important strategy in dealing with HIV is empowering women and protecting their rights,” said Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka.Panellists included HRH the Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Ministers of Gender Equality from Ghana, Malawi, Brazil and a representative for young women living with and affected by HIV from Algeria. ""In my region, discrimination is a societal phenomenon. We must continue to act to eliminate discrimination—it’s the key to the end of the AIDS epidemic,” said Fatima Bendida, El Hayet Network of People Living with HIV, Algeria.The panellists also elaborated on the importance of addressing stigma and discrimination. They stressed the need to end violence against women for their own health, as well as to prevent new HIV infections. They also emphasized the particular focus needed on young women and girls to ensure they have access to comprehensive sexuality education that all women living with HIV have access to treatment, care and support, within a rights-based and social justice framework.“It is essential that we achieve universal access to integrated sexual and reproductive health information, education and services, fully addressing HIV, based on gender equality and with zero-tolerance for gender-based violence,” said HRH Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Patron of UNFPA and Member of the High Level Task Force for the International Conference on Population and DevelopmentThe panellists also highlighted poverty as a driver of HIV and sexual and reproductive ill-health and recognised equity in access to services as a key focus for development for women. They also emphasized the continued need to secure funding for the most marginalized in societies.Ms Nancy Mahon, Executive Director of the M·A·C AIDS Fund moderated the event at which Mr Sidibé launched a UNAIDS Advocacy Brief: Unite with women unite against violence and HIV. The brief outlines five core reasons to prevent violence against women; violence against women is a human rights violation; women who experience violence are more likely to acquire HIV; women living with HIV are more likely to be subjected to violence; women most vulnerable to HIV are also most vulnerable to violence; and that violence undermines the HIV response by creating a barrier to accessing services.The discussions at the panel event were an important milestone in the ongoing post-2015 debate, underlining the central role women living with HIV need to play in the discussions around the post-2015 debate.12 January 201813 December 201707 December 2017"	Health
844	"GENEVA/JOHANNESBURG, 5 March 2014—The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), in cooperation with the Tobeka Madiba Zuma Foundation (TMZF) and the South African Football Association Development Agency (SDA),  have announced the kick-off of the Protect the Goal world tour. Protect the Goal, which was first launched at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, is a campaign to raise awareness around HIV prevention and encourage young people to get actively involved in both the national and global response to HIV.“I'm honored to join forces with SDA and UNAIDS in the AIDS response,"" said Madame Tobeka Madiba Zuma, whose foundation is a co-sponsor of the Protect the Goal campaign. ""I want to help reach as many young people around Africa as I can. While we need to begin with HIV awareness, we also need to deliver HIV testing and treatment to many young people who need our help.""The official world tour kick-off event was held at the Soccer City Stadium, the largest stadium in Africa, during the South Africa-Brazil international friendly game. The world tour will continue its journey through the five African countries—Algeria, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria—whose national teams have qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.The event also provided an opportunity to announce Kweku Mandela and Ndaba Mandela as global spokespersons for Protect the Goal. The objectives of the campaign are to use the popularity and convening power of sport to unite the world for the goal of an AIDS-free generation. The campaign also raises awareness and support for UNAIDS’ vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths.“We are proud to be working with our South African partners in a rapidly evolving environment for mobilizing the global football community against AIDS,” said Dr. Djibril Diallo, Senior Adviser to the Executive Director of UNAIDS.The campaign has garnered support from around the world. UNAIDS has signed cooperation agreements with the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), South American Football Association (CONMEBOL), and Asia Football Confederation (AFC).In Africa, UNAIDS and partners, including youth leaders, have disseminated HIV prevention messages on large electronic screens to football fans in stadiums and fan zones during games, including the Orange Africa Cup of Nations, Africa’s most prestigious football tournament.In Asia, UNAIDS, in cooperation with the Asian Football Confederation and the Asian Development Bank, are engaged in a partnership to enhance awareness of HIV, improve access to HIV prevention and treatment, and work to eliminate HIV-related stigma and discrimination in five pilot countries, Myanmar, Cambodia, Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand.CONCACAF, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, has also promoted the campaign in the framework of major sporting events. During the Gold Cup soccer tournament the captains of the national football teams of the United States and Panama pledged to raise awareness of HIV in the football community.Globally, an estimated 5.4 million adolescents and young people are living with HIV, and 1.8 million are eligible for HIV treatment. Millions of young people living with HIV do not know they living with the virus, and every day, approximately 2100 adolescents and young people become newly infected, which accounts for 36% of all new HIV infections globally.As part of the Protect the Goal Campaign, UNAIDS, TMZF, SDA and Grassroot Soccer, a South African-based, non-profit organization that uses football to educate young people about HIV, will stage a promotional event at the Alexandra Football for Hope Centre on 6 March. The centre provides young people with a safe space to learn about HIV prevention.

849	"A GEL that can be used by women after sex to protect  against HIV is a step closer, according to researchers.The findings, published in Science Translational Medicine,  could  lead to new ways to fight HIV, which is continuing to spread globally.Experts say large clinical trials would be needed to test  any new treatment, and condoms remain the best defence.In the latest research, a US team took a different  approach, testing  a new HIV treatment in monkeys that has the potential to work  after  HIV exposure.They found the gel protected five out of six monkeys from  an  animal-human laboratory strain of HIV when applied shortly before or  three  hours after infection.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in  Atlanta, Georgia,  which led the study, say it is a ""proof of concept""  in an animal model.Dr Charles Dobard, of the division of HIV/Aids  prevention, told BBC  News: ""It's a promising after-sex vaginal gel to  prevent HIV infection.So far, tests have been carried out in only a small  number of  monkeys infected with a combination of HIV and a related monkey  virus.Dr Andrew Freedman, reader and consultant in infectious  diseases at  Cardiff University School of Medicine, said the gel contained a   different class of anti-HIV drug, which attacks the virus at a later  stage in  infection, potentially allowing it to be used after exposure  to infection.""This is proof of concept that such a topically  applied gel, applied  post-coitally, might be effective in preventing HIV  transmission in  humans,"" he said.However, he said caution was needed as the study involved  only a few  monkeys and it had failed to prevent infection in one of the six.Jason Warriner, clinical director at the OTerrence  Higgins Trust,  said having a gel that could be applied after sex would be  ""another  small step forward, particularly in countries where high HIV  rates and  cultural barriers to condom use have created the perfect storm"".But he said no microbicide had yet been found that  offered full protection against HIV.

851	"An encouraging development in the long fight against AIDS: Researchers announced today that a new gel helps protect against HIV infection in monkeys. That's even if it's applied after sex, as long as it's within three hours. And it's got the potential to protect women.  That's according to the New York Times, which reports that the gel is made with the antiretroviral drug raltegravir. Now, this particular formula hasn't been tested on humans yet, and one of the six macaques given the gel was infected anyway, so the effectiveness isn't 100 percent. But if it pans out, the gel ""could be used for H.I.V. prevention like Plan B or the morning-after pill for contraception,"" according to an expert. The approach—also known as ""microbicide"" treatments—has shown promise in previous trials, MSNBC reports, but those gels had to be used too consistently for too long to be really effective. In a particularly sobering explanation, the Times notes that, ""such a gel would be particularly useful in countries where women have little protection against domestic violence or rape, because they could apply it surreptitiously after a partner fell asleep or a clinic could administer it after a rape.""

858	"GENERAL SANTOS CITY (MindaNews/12 March) — Health personnel in South Cotabato province have stepped up their awareness campaign on the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) due to the rising disease incidence of the disease in the area.Dr. Rogelio Aturdido Jr., South Cotabato health officer, said they have adopted the HIV/AIDS campaign as among their top priorities this year due to the “alarming” increase in confirmed cases of the disease in the area in the last three years.“Our campaign is focused on the dissemination of proper information and encouraging more residents to undergo voluntary screening and testing,” he told reporters.In November last year, the Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) confirmed 14 new cases of HIV in the province, bringing the total incidence in the last three years to 45.The official said they have submitted potential cases of the disease to the Department of Health (DOH) in Manila for confirmatory testing and are still waiting for the official results.John Cudilla, IPHO’s HIV/AIDS focal person, said the disease’s incidence in the province has so far reached a total of 146 in the last 10 years based on a report released recently by the DOH’s National Epidemiology Center.He said these cases were found by DOH-accredited screening and testing centers in Metro Manila and in the cities of Iloilo, Cebu, Davao and General Santos. A significant number involved individuals who had engaged in risky sexual behavior, among them unprotected sexual contacts among “men who were having sex with men” or MSM.The earliest HIV/AIDs case involved a woman who tested positive in 2003 and all 10 towns and lone city in the province have recorded cases of the disease, he said.Cudilla said the youngest HIV/AIDS victim in the province is a 20 year-old student while they have so far recorded nine fatalities due to complications caused by the disease.Of the province’s 146 HIV/AIDS cases, he said 137 were asymptomatic or have not exhibited the disease’s typical symptoms.“We have 32 victims who are currently undergoing treatment at the SPMC (Southern Philippines Medical Center) in Davao City,” he said in a radio interview.The HIV victims are specifically undergoing maintenance or antiretroviral drug (ARV) treatment at the SPMC, which is the Department of Health’s designated treatment hub for HIV/AIDS victims from southern and southwestern Mindanao, he said.ARV drug treatment mainly stops the multiplication of the infected person’s viral load and eventually prevents them from further spreading the disease.In some countries, the use of ARV drugs have helped effectively lower the incidence of HIV infection to about one percent and eventually stabilized the detected cases.Cudilla said the IPHO currently maintains a screening facility for HIV/AIDS that is given for free and in confidential manner.In South Cotabato, he said the DOH has also accredited the Doctor’s Clinic and Hospital in Koronadal City and the Howard Hubbard Hospital in Polomolok town as HIV/AIDS screening and testing centers.

862	"As budget cuts continue to take a hit on New York City AIDS Service Organizations, two local groups applaud efforts by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo to ensure that people living with HIV/AIDS aren't homeless or hungry. Cumo promised to help people with the $8 billion in cuts to the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recently passed by Congress, plus 30-day budget amendments for affordable housing for the disabled. ""Governor Andrew Cuomo's commitment to bridge the gap in federal funding caused by dangerous cuts to the food stamp program is an example of historic and moral leadership for the entire nation,"" said Janet Weinberg, interim CEO of GMHC. Columbia University found that nearly 80 percent of the more than 700 people living with HIV/AIDS in New York City participating in its CHAIN study, have food insecurities due to poverty, access SNAP. Food stamps are vital to ensuring that New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS have access to the nutrition they need to take their medication and stay healthy. In 2010, more than 1.7 million people living in New York City received food stamps. Nearly 80 percent of the over 700 people living with HIV/AIDS in New York City who participated in the CHAIN (Community Health Advisory & Information Network) study used food stamps. More than 40 percent of CHAIN study participants reported food insecurity in the past 30 days. The analysis of CHAIN data shows that people living with HIV/AIDS who are food insecure report poor medical outcomes. They are more likely to miss appointments for HIV primary care and had more emergency room visits compared to those who do not report food insecurity.From July 2011 to June 2012, GMHC provided over 92,000 hot, nutritious meals and over 38,000 meals in pantry bags to people living with HIV/AIDS in New York City.ACRIA also applauded Cuomo for ensuring that people disabled by AIDS have a decent and affordable place to live. For the thousands of New Yorkers with AIDS who rely on rental assistance, Gov. Cuomo's 30-day budget amendments are genuinely the difference between having a home and living on the street or in grossly substandard and unhealthy emergency settings.""This smart public health and budget policy will enable more than 10,000 New Yorkers disabled by AIDS who receive rental assistance to pay no more than 30 percent of their income towards rent,"" said Daniel Tietz, the executive director of ACRIA. ""In addition to being fair and equitable, the Governor's action will not only prevent homelessness for many in independent housing, and end their constant financial struggles and fear of homelessness, it will also enable others with HIV/AIDS in emergency SROs to move into much-needed supportive housing. And as has been repeatedly demonstrated.""Tietz said that housing stability would do much to keep these New Yorkers healthy and engaged in care.""In combination with the Governor's recent support of the 30 percent rent cap for permanently disabled New Yorkers living with AIDS receiving housing assistance, Governor Cuomo has sent a clear message -- that fulfilling basic needs such as food, housing, health care and medication access are critical to ending the HIV epidemic in New York State,"" said Weinberg.For more information, visit www.ghmc.org or http://www.acria.org/Winnie McCroy is the Women on the EDGE Editor, HIV/Health Editor, and Assistant Entertainment Editor for EDGE Media Network, handling all women's news, HIV health stories and theater reviews throughout the U.S. She has contributed to other publications, including The Village Voice, Gay City News, Chelsea Now and The Advocate, and lives in Brooklyn, New York.Enter your email address below to receive daily email updates including news, giveaways and more."

As part of the build up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, UNAIDS (the joint United Nations program on HIV) has joined forces with the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Football Confederation to launch an HIV-prevention program aimed at helping tackle the risk of HIV transmission amongst young people in Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, the Philippines and Cambodia. Key partners of the program in the Kingdom include the Football Federation of Cambodia, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, top flight club Phnom Penh Crown and Battambang-based SALT Academy. “Communication and education about the dangers of HIV/AIDS transmission is so important that [Phnom Penh Crown] is wholly committed to take part in this campaign to enhance awareness of HIV, improve access to HIV prevention and treatment and eliminate HIV-related stigma and discrimination,” reads a press release from the club yesterday. The ultimate goal of the program, which uses football as a means to reach out to people, is to achieve ‘Three Zeros’, namely zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths in the respective countries.Prime Minister Hun Sen has instructed the Interior Ministry to investigate the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) and potentially close it “because they follow foreigners”, appearing to link the rights group to the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party's purported “revolution”.

Guide to Lymphedema; Depression and CancerESRD Death Declines in Vasculitis PatientsCanadian scientists are studying a ""handful"" of children who have been treated for HIV within hours of their birth, a member of the research team said.The cases are ""very similar"" to the so-called Mississippi baby, in that they all got full-scale triple HIV therapy in the first few hours of life, according to Hugo Soudeyns, PhD, of the Hôpital Saint-Justine in Montreal.They are also similar, he said, in that very sensitive testing is finding little or no sign of HIV infection, Soudeyns told MedPage Today.The major difference, however, is that all the children remain on antiretroviral therapy and there are no current plans to interrupt treatment, which Soudeyns said would raise ""very serious ethical issues.""""Whenever you think about a functional cure, the ultimate proof would be to interrupt treatment,"" Soudeyns said. ""For obvious reasons, this is something we are being very careful about.""Among other things, he said, the researchers are wary of raising hopes. ""The whole field (of HIV cure) is based on a very few cases,"" he said, and none of them is a clear-cut definitive example.In the now-famous Mississippi case, the child was treated 31 hours after she was born to a mother with uncontrolled HIV. The mother and child were lost to follow-up and when medical care was resumed, doctors found the baby had no sign of HIV infection despite several months off therapy.The child, now 41 months old, remains HIV-negative and off medication, according to Deborah Persaud, MD, of Johns Hopkins University.At the recent Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Persaud reported that she and colleagues are now studying a second child, also treated within hours of birth, who appears to have no sign of HIV. That baby, now 9 months old, remains on treatment.Soudeyns said the American researchers could have looked north at any time for still more cases, since standard care in Canada for several years has been to give newborns full-scale HIV therapy if they are born to mothers with uncontrolled HIV (unlike the U.S., where prophylaxis is favored).While that happens rarely, the researchers know of at least five cases that are ""potentially similar,"" according to their application for a research grant.Soudeyns said they now prefer the less-specific term ""handful"" and are not releasing details such as the ages and sexes of the children pending a report planned for the Canadian Association for HIV Research meeting in May.The goals of the study are to see if the early treatment leads to differences in the HIV reservoir, compared with children whose treatment started later, and to assess if there are any differences in their immune systems, Soudeyns said.Persaud told MedPage Today that the Canadian cases are ""exciting"" and might add to the evidence that very early treatment can restrict the ""dissemination"" of HIV in infected newborns.But she noted the Canadians will need to show that the children in their cohort were actually infected with HIV, not just exposed to the virus. And in the long run, she added, the proof of the benefit of very early therapy will be treatment cessation.""We really have only one (baby) who's gone off treatment and has remained in viral remission,"" she said.A clinical trial, with such treatment interruption built in as an endpoint, is in the planning stages, with the aim of answering questions about timing and follow-up of treatment cessation, as well seeing if the early therapy does in fact lead to lasting remission.The Canadian researchers have $1.9 million (Canadian dollars, or $1.71 million in U.S. dollars) over 5 years from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to carry out their study, which so far involves patients at three institutions  --  the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, and Hôpital Sainte-Justine in Montreal.But Soudeyns said he and colleagues are also working with all other pediatric HIV clinics in Canada and hope to find more cases.last updated 03.11.2014The material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider.© 2018 MedPage Today, LLC.

""Once that was said, we then followed through with a report to the state Department of Health,"" hospital spokesman Damian Becker told NBC News.The hospital reported that at-risk patients were admitted from March 2011 through to January 2014. During their stay, the patients had been administered insulin shots via a multidose pen.  The insulin pens contain disposable needles in a cartridge or reservoir that have doses of the hormone, insulin. Since the pens cut into a patient's skin, blood can end up contaminating the device, which could then contaminate another user. It is standard procedure to use one pen per patient. The hospital stated that reusing multidose insulin pens has never occurred at the hospital before this incident.""The risk of infection from this is extremely low,"" the hospital said in a statement reported by Reuters Health. ""South Nassau has already implemented a hospital-wide policy that bans the use of insulin pens and permits only the use of single-patient-use vials to administer prescribed insulin treatments to patients.""So far, around 200 patients have scheduled their blood tests.TagsInsulin, pen, Exposure, HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, Diabetes, blood testYou have already subscribed.

  In the letter dated February 22, South Nassau Communities
  Hospital said the patients may have received insulin from an
  insulin pen reservoir – not the pen's single-use disposable
  needle – that may have been used with more than one person.

  Damian Becker, spokesman for the hospital in Oceanside on Long
  Island – near New York City – said no medical staff had been
  observed reusing the insulin pen reservoir. The warning was
  issued, however, because a nurse was overheard saying it was
  alright to do so.
""Once that was said, we then followed through with a report
  to the state Department of Health,"" hospital spokesman
  Damian Becker told the Long Island daily Newsday.

  Earlier, the hospital released a statement saying ""The risk
  of infection from this is extremely low,"" though it
  recommended patients ""be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C
  and HIV.""
  Becker said the hospital was sending out the letters in batches
  and the hospital announced it has set up a toll-free hotline for
  patients to schedule a blood test.

  It will take patients about two weeks to receive test results, he
  said.

  When asked by Reuters if anyone was confirmed to have been
  infected, a hospital spokeswoman said ""not to my
  knowledge.""
  The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease
  Control both released strongly worded statements between 2009 and
  2012 following a rash of similar incidents at other hospitals
  that put more than 2,000 patients at risk.

  The agency warned it had become “increasingly aware of
  reports of improper use of insulin pens” that “must never be used
  on more than one person.”“When you use the pen for more than one patient, you have the
  possibility of introducing the bodily fluids from someone else
  into another individual,” Dr. Alison Myers, an
  endocrinologist with the North Shore-LIJ Health System, told CBS
  New York.

  The Long Island hospital said it has since banned the use of
  insulin pens and permits only the use of single-patient-use
  vials. The hospital seems to have changed its policy on the
  devices, though it was unclear when the change occurred.
""South Nassau has already implemented a hospital-wide policy
  that bans the use of insulin pens and permits only the use of
  single-patient-use vials to administer prescribed insulin
  treatments to patients,"" the statement said.

  The time frame of potential expose was between March 2011 and
  January 2014.

""We've been inundated with calls, as you might expect,"" hospital spokesman Damian Becker said. Becker said that as of 2:35 p.m. Wednesday the hospital had booked 115 appointments and returned an additional 70 calls -- and had more to return. Becker apologized if people had been put on hold and encouraged them to keep trying. ""We're pounding away at it as best we can,"" he said. ""We take this very seriously."" South Nassau is offering free and confidential testing for those notified. To arrange a test, call 516-208-0029. In the Feb. 22 letter, the Oceanside hospital said the patients may have received insulin from an insulin pen cartridge -- not the pen's needle, which is used only once -- that could have been used on more than one patient.Those diabetics potentially exposed were patients between March 2011 and January 2014, Becker said. The best of Newsday every day in your inbox.

""This is because it may take up to six months for the test to become positive after an exposure, and we are recommending this out of an abundance of caution,"" he said.An insulin pen is a pre-filled syringe that can be used multiple times -- but on only one patient. Because of potential backflow of a patient's blood into the pen cartridge after injection, using a pen on more than one patient could expose them to blood-borne infections.Becker said no one was observed reusing the insulin pen cartridge on more than one patient, but a nurse was heard saying it was all right to do so. That triggered a report to the state Department of Health.George Hebert, 69, of Freeport, said he got a letter Wednesday from the hospital. A diabetic, he said he went to South Nassau after he broke his arm Dec. 30 and was released Jan. 4.Frantic about possibly passing a disease on to his wife, who helps him test his blood twice daily, he said it took four phone calls Wednesday before he got through to the hospital. ""And I still don't have an appointment,"" he said. ""I will be worried until I know I'm not going to infect my wife."" Evelyn McKnight of Fremont, Neb., a national advocate for safe needle use, said New York has been a leader in proper needle use, and the problem is with health care providers.""It behooves the providers to follow the guidelines,"" said McKnight, who founded HONOReform after she got hepatitis C in 2004 at a cancer clinic.

876	Canadians will soon need to pay more to watch series and movies on Netflix. The company has raised the price of its plans for both new and existing users. While the rise has been already implemented for new subscribers, existing users will be notified through email before new rates are charged from them.In a statement released by Netflix, the company cited addition of new content and introduction of new features and services as the reasons behind the price rise. It said that Netflix adjusts the pricing of its packages from time to time as they introduce new movies, exclusive TV series and upgrade their platform to offer better services to its customers.The company has a huge database of content and also produces its own original content which has become popular like House of Cards. It also has a large number of movies sourced exclusively from international film festivals. Few of USA TV shows are also aired by Netflix in Canada like CW’s Riverdale and ABC’s Scandal.Netflix has a growing market in Canada and in 2016 it had around 5.2 million subscriptions. The television streaming market is quite competitive in Canada and many leading names are fighting out with each other.Brands like Amazon prime are quite a hit in the country having Canadian airing rights of highly rated shows such as American Gods and Mr. Robot. CBS All Access is also set to enter the Canadian market sometime in 2018 with its 9,000 episodes from various shows. The multiple numbers of competitors and the fight to acquire rights for shows has increased the acquisition cost of the content. Though Netflix did not mention it in their statement, still it is a situation faced by all companies in Canadian television industry.Netflix increased their prices last year in May while introducing the feature of streaming in high quality on multiple devices. This time the increase has been $1 for the basic plan making it $8.99 per month. Users can only stream standard quality videos on a single device at a time. The cost of the standard plan has also gone up by $1 ($10.99 per month) which permits subscribers to access content on two screens. Subscribers of the premium plan now have to shell out a monthly $13.99, which is a $2 increase from the previous price. Users can view high definition 4k videos simultaneously on four screens with this plan.The company changes its prices based on local market conditions in a country. The Australian subscribers had to pay few dollars more after Netflix raised the prices in June countering the increase in local taxes. It remains to be seen how the users will respond to the move.TV streaming service in Canada will get a major boost next year with the introduction of CBS Corp’s CBS All Access service. It is the company’s bid to go international that prompted the move and gave Canada the first opportunity to enjoy its content.The online streaming service in the US has a huge database of content and around 9,000 episodes from its various series. Viewers will also get access to special CBS channels like Showtime without requiring a cable connection. Apart from television activities, those who fond of games playing can try out one of the secure Canadian source NBSO online casino games list website. It is free and has a high level of reliability (si vous parlez français, essayez de choisir des jeux sur le site web du guide spécial casino en ligne, qui est fiable et gratuit).CBS corp. has a good chance of creating a considerable grab on the market but it lacks on one ground. The copyrights of many of its shows are already purchased by Canadian broadcasters like Rogers Communications Inc., BCE Inc. and Corus Entertainment Inc. So viewers will not get to see shows like Survivor or The Big Bang Theory and some of the shows are also aired on Netflix. The restricted content may impact the number of subscribers the company is expecting.We have to wait and see as CBS predicts they are going to have 4 million subscriptions by the end of this year. It is interesting to note that TV viewership is declining in Canada and online streaming services are giving a tough competition to the traditional form. In 2016, the volume of subscribers reduced by 1% and reached 11.1 billion viewers and the revenue fell by 2% amounting to $8.7 billion, according to the data from Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.On the other hand, online streaming services have gained increased number of subscriptions. Netflix recorded a growth of 52 million viewers in US alone and another 52 million from all over the world. Compared to that, 158,000 people in Canada disconnected their cable service in 2015. It can be expected that the market is ripe for online streaming in Canada and other players like Hulu and HBO Go may join the competition in some years.With so many providers in the game, the price is also a big factor in getting subscriptions. CBS did not reveal the rates they will charge in Canada, but in the US current rates are $5.99 per month. To get a commercial free version, viewers have to pay $9.99. If the rates are any higher, then Canadian may not be too interested in joining up considering the limitation of content.Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS said that they were aware of the potential of online streaming judging the success of their competitors. The introduction of the service in Canada gives them the chance to directly reach the viewer on an increased scale which can be expanded globally. CBS All Access had achieved a growing domestic market and now is ready with their premium content to hit the international arena.Auto insurance provider Intact Insurance in Nova Scotia plan to use mobile apps to track driver habits to determine the premium rates in the future. Based on the way one drives, they can be eligible for a 25% savings on their insurance premium!The idea may sound out of a science fiction movie but the concept has existed for some time. Many companies like Intact Insurance offer a plug in dongles for vehicles which are used to track driver habits. Intact insurance revealed that the dongle program included 350,000 participants from all over the country. It was introduced at N.S in 2014.However, they are not always the practical solution due to various reasons.First is the cost that prohibits their universal use and in some cases, the devices are not returned to the company. They can also be lost adding to the cost of the company. Another reason is the dongles track the habits of any driver that gets behind the wheel and it is not possible to distinguish between them.Mobile apps have many unique advantages that make them a pragmatic solution for the insurance companies. The app would be using the smart phone of the driver and eliminate any expense on part of the insurance provider. They will also be able to specifically track the habits of the insurance payer which is their priority. It will only monitor the main driver as the app will be linked to his mobile phone.The tool will be used to track aspects of sudden accelerations, hard braking, night driving utilizing the GPS feature of the phones. Intact Insurance applied for permission to launch the program from the N.S Utility and Review Board which was granted on August 4. The company plans to launch the service next month starting September. The initiative will be a way to reward drivers with good habits and give them lower insurance rates for their performance.For the time being, the app or the dongle insurance rates are optional in Canada. But according to experts, a day may come when it automatically becomes more preferable considering the costs. With the advance of technology, the companies may increase the cost of the premium and people will opt for the tracking program for affordability.But not all customers may be willing to join the program. It has been seen that many consumers do not prefer to join such programs. Some also practice bad driving habits like speeding or other dangerous stunts which may impact the insurance rates. There are also some apprehensions about the nature of data collected by the app and its usage by the company. But as the insurance industry is regulated it has not misused the user data under its control.	Health

	A Long Island hospital has recommended blood tests for 4,200 people admitted from March 2011 to January 2014 if they received insulin shots from a multidose 'pen.'
	Letters sent by South Nassau Communities Hospital advised patients to have their blood screened for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
	The warning came after a nurse was heard saying it was acceptable to use multidose insulin pens on different patients, hospital spokesman Damian Beckner told the Daily News.
	The pens, which have disposable needles, dispense doses of insulin to diabetics. Medical standards dictate that pens be used by only one patient since blood can seep into the insulin cartridge and contaminate the hormone.
	Using a cartridge for multiple patients was never seen at the hospital, Beckner said. But the overheard comments of a nurse saying she considered that practice acceptable was ""taken very seriously,"" he said.
	In consultation with the New York State Department of Health, hospital officials decided to alert patients who had received insulin shots at the medical center. The facility has also stopped using insulin pens.
	Free and confidential blood testing is being offered at the hospital.

				It all started when that nurse was overheard saying to someone else that it’s okay to reuse the pen on multiple people.More than 4,000 patients got the unnerving letter from South Nassau Communities Hospital on Long Island warning them about the exposure.A hospital spokesperson said the risk is low and that they jumped to action as soon as they heard.""Once that was said, we then followed through with a report to the state Department of Health.""The hospital is now urging patients to get tested for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.This may sound familiar to some. An oral surgery office in Tulsa, Okla. was in a similar situation in 2013 when it was found to have potentially exposed around 7,000 patients to HIV and Hepatitis C.Only a few cases of transmission were linked back to the offices of Dr. Scott Harrington, who is no longer practicing.As for the Long Island hospital, it has stopped using the multi-use pens and has gone back to the old method of using single-use insulin vials.There are no comments yet.

880	"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A frightening warning has been issued for thousands of patients who were treated at a Long Island hospital.As CBS 2’s Carolyn Gusoff reported Wednesday, South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside has called for blood tests for thousands of patients who may have been exposed to dangerous viruses, including hepatitis and HIV, through insulin shots.The hospital is sending out 4,247 letters to patients who may have received insulin from an insulin pen reservoir that might have been reused rather than a single-use needle, between March 2011 and this January.Cynthia Shub was among those who have received the letter.“I see ‘shared’ and ‘patients’ — the neighbors could have heard me scream,” she said.Shub received an insulin shot at the hospital last year, and was shocked at the concerns the letter expressed.“I see hepatitis, I see HIV; I’m like, ‘Are you kidding?’” she said.Another patient who received the letter did not want to show his face.“Shocking — very shocking, and very disturbing,” he said. “Someone screwed up somewhere.”Hospital officials said concerns stemmed from one nurse heard saying insulin pens can be used on multiple patients. Insulin is held in a chamber for multiple uses on the same patient.“It just doesn’t make sense that something like this could happen like this nowadays. It’s not like something that’s not known; don’t share this stuff. And the hospital did it. You know, if people do it, it’s one thing. A hospital does it? It’s a little ridiculous,” a woman told WCBS 880 Long Island Bureau Chief Mike Xirinachs.The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control both released strongly worded reminders between 2009 and 2012 following several similar incidents at other hospitals that put more than 2,000 patients at risk.The agency warned it had become “increasingly aware of reports of improper use of insulin pens” that “must never be used on more than one person.”“When you use the pen for more than one patient, you have the possibility of introducing the bodily fluids from someone else into another individual,” said Dr. Alison Myers, an endocrinologist with the North Shore-LIJ Health System.A South Nassau spokesman said no one was seen reusing the pen, and fresh needles were used for each patient.“The risk of infection from this is extremely low,” the hospital statement said. “Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, the hospital is recommending that patients receiving the notification be tested.”Shub said she will now have to go through an agonizing wait for test results.“You go into a hospital, you expect to be taken care of, not to be given a disease,” she said.A spokesman for the hospital said it is no longer using the insulin pen. The hospital has replaced the pens with single-use syringes.The hospital has set up a toll-free hotline for patients to schedule a blood test at (516) 208-0029 and is asking patients to schedule a blood test within 60 days of receiving the letter.Check Out These Other Stories From CBSNewYork.com:

            Published: March 12 2014
        Patients at a Long Island hospital being treated for diabetes may now be at risk of hepatitis and HIV.
More than 4,000 patients of South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside are receiving a letter about the risk of hepatitis and HIV infection as a result of being treated for diabetes with the use of an insulin pen.
Patients may have received insulin injections from a pen reservoir that was used by more than one patient. The pens used were not the single-use needles, but rather ones that contained multiple insulin doses with a disposable needle.
While the hospital confirms the disposable needles were changed out with each new patient, the pen may have not. The danger lies in that the chamber containing the insulin may be contaminated if there is a back flow of blood.
A statement provided by a hospital spokesman indicates “the risk of infection from this is extremely low, nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, the hospital is recommending that patients receiving the notification be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.”
To prevent such an incident from happening again, a hospital-wide policy is in place to only use single-use vials for insulin treatment.
Patients who received the letter recommending testing are asked to schedule testing within 60 days by calling (516) 208-0029. Blood testing services will be provided to these patients for free.

It has set up a toll-free hotline for patients to schedule a blood test.The situation appears to be similar to one Olean General Hospital found itself in in early 2013.On Jan. 24 of that year, Olean General officials sent out letters to 1,915 former patients warning them that they may have been exposed HIV and hepatitis B and C through the potential reuse of multi-injection insulin pens between November 2009 and Jan. 16. Hospital officials urged recipients to get blood tests for the diseases and indefinitely suspended use of the devices at the facility.The Olean Times Herald reported the letters were sent out after the hospital conducted its own internal investigation, prompted by a discovery at the Buffalo VA Medical Center in the fall of 2012 that as many as 716 former patients may have been exposed to the same blood-borne diseases through the reuse of multi-injection insulin pens.The pens are small devices which contain a reservoir of insulin that can be used for multiple injections. When the multi-dose pens are used, bodily fluids can backflow into the insulin reservoir, creating risk for blood-borne diseases to be spread if another patient is treated with the device. Hospital officials told the Times Herald that the pens were labeled with the intended patient’s name and a new, sterile needle was affixed to each device before each use.Several lawsuits were filed against Olean General in New York State Supreme Court in Cattaraugus County by former patients who received letters.In the months that followed, Olean General offered testing to those potentially infected. The New York state and Cattaraugus County Departments of Health were made aware of the situation and monitored blood screening results. Dr. Kevin Watkins, the county’s Public Health director, reported that testing did not indicate there was an outbreak of HIV or both strains of hepatitis among the potentially infected former patients.Includes our e-Edition at no extra cost!If you have an event you'd like to list on the site, submit it now!

While nurses used new needles for each patient, they did not use a fresh pen.Blood may have back-flowed into the chamber contaminating the insulin, the hospital warned.“It’s just shocking to hear something like that,” said hospital visitor Peter Vetro. “I just can’t believe that.”In a statement, a hospital spokesman said while “the risk of infection from this is extremely low, nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, the hospital is recommending that patients receiving the notification be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.”Since the scare, South Nassau has implemented a hospital-wide policy that bans the use of insulin pens and now only permits single-patient-use vials to administer insulin treatments.However, loved ones visiting patients at the hospital on Tuesday night were still frightened to hear this warning.“It’s actually very scary,” said hospital visitor Andra Vetro, “because you come to the hospital when you’re sick, and you don’t hope to get even worse while you’re inside the hospital.”The hospital said while the testing process is voluntary, it is recommended.

The hospital says the risk of infection is “extremely low.” It has set up a toll-free hotline for patients to schedule a blood test. The number is 516-208-0029.


Newsday (http://bit.ly/1fSFQSK ) reports that in a letter dated Feb. 22, South Nassau Communities Hospital said patients may have received insulin from an insulin pen reservoir that could have been used more than once.


Hospital spokesman Damian Becker said no one was observed reusing the insulin pen reservoir, but a nurse was heard saying it was all right to do so.



He says the hospital was recommending testing out of an “abundance of caution.”

	 South Nassau Communities Hospital is sending out thousands of letters to patients who may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV.      Photo Credit: Danielle Finkelstein     South Nassau Communities Hospital is sending out 4,247 letters to patients recommending they be tested for hepatitis B and C and HIV because of the risk of infection from an insulin pen. In the letter dated Feb. 22, the Oceanside hospital said the patients may have received insulin from an insulin pen reservoir -- not the pen's single-use disposable needle -- that could have been used with more than one patient. An insulin pen for those with diabetes is a pre-filled syringe meant to be used to dispense insulin in a single patient. Because of potential backflow of a patient's blood into the pen cartridge after injection, using a pen on multiple patients may expose them to blood-borne infections. Hospital spokesman Damian Becker said no one was observed reusing the insulin pen reservoir on more than one patient, but a nurse was heard saying it was all right to do so.""Once that was said, we then followed through with a report to the state Department of Health,"" Becker said.The hospital said risk of infection is ""extremely low."" ""Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, the hospital is recommending that patients receiving the notification be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. While the testing is voluntary, it is recommended,"" the hospital said. The best of Newsday every day in your inbox. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.Becker said Tuesday the hospital, which is sending the letters out in phases, has received about 200 phone calls so far. The last letters should be received by March 17, Becker said.It will take patients about two weeks to receive test results, he said.The hospital said it has since banned the use of insulin pens and permits only the use of single-patient-use vials. The state Department of Health said that last year three health facilities reported potential insulin pen re-use: two state-regulated facilities and the Veterans Administration's medical center in Buffalo. South Nassau is offering free and confidential blood testing and has set up a dedicated telephone line for those patients notified. To arrange a test, call 516-208-0029. Insulin pen misuse is not uncommon.In May 2008, Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow notified 840 patients that nurses may have been using insulin pens on multiple patients. In 2009, following reports of improper use of insulin pens in hospitals, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert reminding health care workers that insulin pens are meant for use on a single patient only.In 2012, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that ""in spite of this alert, there have been continuing reports of patients placed at risk through inappropriate reuse and sharing of insulin pens,"" and it put out a clinical reminder on their proper use. Last year, the VA issued an alert systemwide following the report of insulin pen misuse at its Buffalo hospital. Of 395 patients tested, 12 were found with hepatitis B and six with hepatitis C.

896	"Independent Nurse, In Venissieux, France. Home Of A Diabetic Patient With Type 1 Diabetes, Injection Of Insulin. (Photo By BSIP/UIG Via Getty Images)OCEANSIDE, New York (PIX11) – South Nassau Counties Hospital is warning thousands of patients of possible blood contamination, including serious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis.In a letter to patients, hospital officials say that a single-use insulin pen may have been reused with multiple patients.“The risk of infection from this is extremely low, nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, the hospital is recommending that patients receiving the notification be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV,” officials said. “While the testing is voluntary, it is recommended.”According to the hospital, the component of the insulin pen that was reused was the reservoir, not the needles.  Because of the backflow of blood mixed with insulin, however, there could still be a risk of contamination.“South Nassau has already implemented a hospital-wide policy that bans the use of insulin pens and permits only the use of single-patient-use vials to administer prescribed insulin treatments to patients,” according to an official.The hospital is recommending anyone who believes they could be at risk get tested.  To arrange a free and confidential test, patients are encouraged to call (516) 208-0029.Filed in: News It's South Nassau Communities Hospital As a nurse I would like to know who is so stupid that they would use an insulin pen on multiple patients????

898	Fitbit Force users began complaining of skin irritation issues a bit earlier in the year. There seemed to be a fair amount of complaints, but we do have to remember that the most vocal are often the ones having issues. Fitbit was responsive to the complaints and issued a voluntary recall as well as halted new sales. At the time there was mention of how this affected 1.7 percent of users and that it was basically an allergic reaction to the band. Or more specifically, to some of the materials used to make the band. More recently though, it seems the US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued an official recall notice. The notice, which was posted on the CPSC.gov website also touched on some numbers. And this time we are seeing more than the 1.7 percent mention. It looks like this affected roughly 10,000 users. “The firm has received about 9,900 reports of the wristband causing skin irritation and about 250 reports of blistering.”There was also mention of Fitbit having sold “about” 1 million in the US, and another 28,000 in Canada. Simply put, while it is refreshing to see Fitbit step up, and the CPSC also get in on the recall notifications, this truly did affect a small number of Force users.The CPSC recall notice mentions how customers should look towards Fitbit for a full refund. This is also what we heard from Fitbit when they originally issued the voluntary recall. To make the process as easy as possible, Fitbit has a recall page setup that will guide you through the process. You can find that page here. VIA: CNET	Health

900	"Activity trackers, also known as fitness bands, are popular wearable devices that are designed, among other purposes, to give users insights into their sleeping habits, the option to track the time and distance they walk and the number of steps they make. In the case of the Fitbit Force, however, activity trackers are also giving users rashes.Fitbit has officially revealed 1.7 percent of Force users have reported skin irritations, which has led the company to announce a voluntary recall and issue a public apology. In two filings, with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Healthy Canadians agency, the wearables company reveals the extent of the recall -- roughly one million units in US and ""about"" 28,000 north of the border, in Canada, sold between October 2013 and February 2014.""Users can develop allergic reactions to the stainless steel casing, materials used in the strap, or adhesives used to assemble the product, resulting in redness, rashes or blistering where the skin has been in contact with the tracker"", says the US filing.In US, Fitbit says it has received roughly 9,900 reports of skin irritations and 250 reports of blistering. In Canada the number of reported irritations is lower, only 50, most likely the significant difference is due to the number of units sold to local consumers.The model numbers that fall under the recall are FB402BK, FB402BKS, FB402SL and FB402SLS in US, and FB402BK-CAN, FB402BKS-CAN, FB402SL-CAN, FB402SLS-CAN in Canada (UPC numbers 898628002885, 898628002892, 898628002960 and 898628002977).Fitbit Force buyers are advised to contact the company for a full refund, and obviously put the activity tracker aside immediately if they have not done so already. Fitbit has set up this page to help those who are affected to return the product and receive the refund.Photo Credit: Aleksandar Mijatovic/ShutterstockComments are closed.© 1998-2018 BetaNews, Inc.

902	"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againItchy skin and rashes? You're not the only one. The activity tracker-maker offers a full refund to all users of the device.
Some side effects can come with activity monitoring with a Fitbit Force health tracker, but they're not sore muscles or an accelerated heart rate -- rather, they involve skin irritation around the wrist. 

More than 10,000 people have reported skin irritation -- including redness, rashes, itchy and dry patches, and blistering -- from their Fitbit Force, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. Because of these issues, the CPSC posted Fitbit's official recall notice on its site on Wednesday. Now, all Force owners can get a full refund for their device.

The $129 Force, which is an upgraded version of the popular Fitbit Flex, comes in the form of a slim rubber wristband and is wired to count users' steps and monitor their sleep. The backside of the device contains stainless steel components that use trace amounts of nickel, along with latex-free elastomer materials and adhesives. Fitbit believes the skin irritation could be coming from some users' allergies to these materials.

Here's a statement that Fitbit emailed to CNET on Wednesday:


 

According to the CPSC, 9,900 people reported skin irritation from the Force and 250 people reported blistering. While these numbers seem high, they're actually accounting for less than 1 percent of the devices out there -- which is pegged at 1 million in the US and 28,000 in Canada.

The company announced that it stopped selling the Force and issued a voluntary recall of the device last month but didn't release details on the amount of people affected. Also, it wasn't clear if the recall extended to all users -- as it now does.

To get the word out, Fitbit posted updates to its Twitter and Facebook accounts on Wednesday announcing the voluntary recall notice.

	Fitbit issued a voluntary recall of its Fitbit Force after discovering that prolonged use could lead to skin irritation likely due to allergy to some of the materials used in its construction, but now the recall is official with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, making it illegal to resell (like on eBay) the existing Force at all, and revealing some details about the scope of the recall.Around 1 million units in the U.S. and about 28,000 in Canada are included in the recall, which gives some idea about Fitbit’s sales number for its wearable activity tracker since the device’s introduction back in October last year.Besides providing some context for how far-reaching the recall is, this also gives us a rare peek behind the curtain at how many units are being sold by the leading device makers in this category. We’ve seen info about sales share and cumulative totals, but manufacturers have been mostly quiet on unit shipment or sales numbers for individual models.What we can glean from the Fitbit Force rough shipment numbers is that the activity tracker market is still mostly one with niche appeal, and nowhere near the consumer sales numbers of devices like smartphones or tablets. Still, one million moved in roughly one quarter isn’t half bad for a startup working in an emerging consumer hardware product category.Fitbit can probably bounce back from this recall without being set back too much, although part of that will be determined by how quickly they can get the Force back onto store shelves to capitalize on strong consumer interest. Only 1.7 percent of Force owners reported being affected by the issue that prompted the recall, according to the company itself, and anecdotally, I know a lot of owners who are hanging on to their first-generation hardware.We’ve contacted Fitbit for additional comment on the numbers and this development, and will update if they have anything to add.Update: Fitbit provided the following information about the recall –The Fitbit Force voluntary recall was officially announced today by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Fitbit has stopped selling Force and is currently working with the CPSC to conduct a recall. For immediate concerns or more information on how to receive a full refund/exchange for a new product, users can please visit: http://www.fitbit.com/forcesupport or call: 888-656-6381.More details:
· Fitbit is working on its next-generation tracker and will announce details soon.· Fitbit has stopped selling Force and is currently working with the CPSC to conduct a recall. The recall was officially announced by CPSC and Fitbit on March 12.· A thorough analysis by independent labs and medical experts revealed that the reactions reported by a small percentage of Force users were likely the result of allergic contact dermatitis.· Some users may be reacting to the stainless steel used in the device—although it is surgical grade and meets the most stringent regulatory standards—while others are likely experiencing an allergic reaction to the materials in the strap or the adhesives used to assemble the product.· Fitbit launched an investigation immediately upon discovering that there was an issue and has been working with medical experts to determine the cause of the skin irritation. Fitbit has worked with the CPSC on the voluntary recall plan.· Fitbit will be emailing all Force users over the next few weeks so that they are aware of the recall and the offer of a refund for full retail price. This will complement the outreach efforts via community forums and other venues.· Users can find more details on our website: http://www.fitbit.com/forcesupport or by calling our dedicated call center at: 888-656-6381. Latest headlines delivered to you daily"	Health
906	"FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (WTVR) - It's the call Mae Staton had been praying about for quite some time.  Her grandson, seven-year old Josh Hardy, needed an experimental drug to survive a deadly virus.On Tuesday, Staton got the call from her daughter, saying that Josh would get the medicine.""I just screamed,"" said Staton about the call.  ""I was just so excited.Hardy, who at seven years old has battled cancer his entire life, came down with the virus following a bone marrow transplant last year.His doctors say beating the virus will require one particular drug called brincidofovir. The company Chimerix, which makes the drug, originally said it could not be released outside of controlled clinical trials. ""We had almost gotten to the point that were giving up; that [Chimerix] just weren't going to do it,"" said Staton.Staton said her grandson knew the gravity and details of his situation the entire time.  The seven-year old has been in and out of the hospital nearly his entire life, so Staton said he possesses an advanced knowledge of the medical field for his age.Hardy, his parents, and his brothers are at St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., where Hardy will be enrolled as the first patient of an open-label trial of brincidofovir.  Doctors told his family the drug can significantly improve his condition in as little as two weeks.Chimerix president and CEO, Kenneth Moch, told CBS News they had been working with the FDA for some time trying to figure out how to get Hardy the drug.""People sometimes loss sight of the fact that it's a regulated process, and we're doing our best to work as quickly as we can,"" said Moch.St. Jude, the Memphis hospital where Hardy is being treated, released a statement: This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children. For this reason, it  will be administered under a new treatment protocol as approved by a committee charged with compliance to federal and institutional regulations for clinical research (IRB).  It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation.St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients.  We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.""Just to know that Josh has a chance; he's going to make it,"" said Staton.Filed in: News Topics: Chimerix, Fredericksburg, Health and Wellness, Josh Hardy Thank you, Mr. Moch!

When asked whether or not he thought 7-year-old Josh Hardy should receive lifesaving treatment, a member of the board of directors at Chimerix seemed to blame government regulation for the company’s reluctance to give Josh access to their drug Brincidofovir.“Don’t you people realize there is an FDA?  We have done what we can.  Say a prayer for Josh,” Tim Wollaeger wrote in an email to FoxNews.com.The snarky remark came just hours after Chimerix announced it would begin a pilot trial for Brincidofovir – an antiviral drug that has been proven to clear up adenovirus in children within two weeks. Josh will be the program’s first patient.Chimerix initially refused to give Josh, who had developed adenovirus after undergoing a bone marrow transplant, emergency access to the medication. But after receiving intense criticism over their denial, the pharmaceutical company reversed their decision Tuesday night.Chimerix did not want to utilize the FDA's expanded access program as they thought it would interfere with their phase III clinical trial on the drug.The FDA program -- sometimes called compassionate use -- allows patients to use investigational drugs outside of clinical trials in order to treat serious or life threatening diseases with no alternative treatments. Wollaeger serves on the board of directors for Chimerix and was previously a co-chairmen of the board from 2002-2010. He specializes in investing in early-stage biotech and health care companies, and since 2002, he’s been the managing director for Sanderling Ventures, an investment firm focused on biomedical companies. Wollaeger is also on the board of directors for CalciMedica, Sotera Wireless, Asteres and several other Sanderling Ventures companies.FoxNews.com reached out to all of Chimerix’s board members about Josh’s case, but only two responded. The second member, Wende Hutton, gave a more gentle response:“We are all wishing Josh a speedy recovery,” Hutton, a general partner at Canaan Partners, wrote in an email to FoxNews.com.Chimerix CEO Kenneth Moch has come under fire for how he and the company have handled Josh’s case.  A representative for the Max Cure Foundation, a pediatric cancer charity who had offered to pay for Josh’s treatment, said that Moch hung up on him when discussing the situation.Adenovirus is an acute infection that can be deadly in people with compromised immune systems. Doctors at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn recommended that Josh be treated with Brincidofovir, but the drug has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which prevented Josh’s family from gaining access to the medication.  Thanks to Chimerix’s reverse decision, Josh received the drug early Wednesday morning.View AllThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

912	"A 7-year-old Virginia boy struggling with a serious infection began a potentially lifesaving drug treatment Wednesday after his family's awareness campaign went viral and spurred the FDA and a pharmaceutical company to fast-track a new drug trial.First-grader Josh Hardy contracted adenovirus during a bone marrow transplant, which he needed as part of his treatment for leukemia. Though the viral infection typically has mild effects, Josh's cancer-weakened immune system has been more susceptible. His doctors at a Tennessee hospital recommended that he receive the experimental drug brincidofovir.But the manufacturer, Chimerix, a small drug manufacturer in Durham, N.C., said it was still in early testing of its only drug as a treatment for adenovirus patients with weakened immune systems. It refused to give Josh the drug through a ""compassionate use"" exception that would have ensured he didn't receive a placebo during the study.Helping Josh, the company said, would have led other patients in drug trials to lodge similar emotional appeals in the media to avoid placebos. Deciding whom to help would have grown burdensome for the small company and could have marred attempts to get the FDA to approve it if notable patients, such as Josh, die despite its use.Through an agreement with the FDA announced Tuesday, Josh becomes the first of 20 patients guaranteed to receive the medication in what the company described as a pilot test. It is expected to serve as a precursor to a typical, double-blind clinical trial.""Josh Hardy's story brought to public attention the often-devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix,"" the company said in a statement.  ""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make,"" Chimerix Chief Executive Kenneth Moch said in the statement. ""It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value.""St. Jude’s Children's Research Hospital called Josh's medical situation ""critical and complex.""""We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome,"" the hospital said. ""We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.""Josh’s mom celebrated the news.“Glory to GOD! They are releasing the drug for Josh!!!!!!!!!,” Aimee Hardy said on Facebook.Chimerix’s announcement came the night before Josh's supporters planned to travel to Durham to protest outside the company's office. Supporters had rallied on social media, and Josh's family had appeared on national television during the last few days. The company had said it would not reverse course.But the growing interest in the case led to a conversation between the company and the FDA, which has generally granted compassionate use exceptions. The FDA said the pilot study agreement was in everybody's best interest and avoided the worries that the drugmaker had about making the drug available through the compassionate use provision. In a trial late last year, brincidofovir proved successful at warding off adenovirus immediately after it was detected in the blood. But Josh has been infected since mid-Feburary.At 9 months old he developed an aggressive cancer in his kidneys, according to the family. Chemotherapy eviscerated the softball- and walnut-sized tumors, but only temporarily. He’s been in and out of hospitals his entire life, most recently suffering from leukemia.Follow LATimes National on Facebook ALSO: Massive explosion and fire kill at least 2 in New YorkNavajo Code Talkers ask for help with decrepit dwellingsHundreds stranded in Montana after ice and snow give way to floods "	Health

914	"by Greta Kreuz(WJLA) - After days of pleading with drug company executives, Josh Hardy's parents got what they had been praying for: a chance to get an experimental drug that could save their son's life.The drug's maker, Chimerix, said Tuesday that the ailing 7-year-old will receive medicine that doctors hope will help save his life.The Fredericksburg first-grader has beaten cancer four times since he was just nine months old, but his suppressed immune system couldn't beat a virus he contracted after a recent bone marrow transplant.When Josh's doctors tried to get him an experimental drug called brincidofovir, Chimerix refused. The Hardy's turned to social media, hoping Chimerix would change its mind and give Josh a fighting chance.An FDA policy known as ""compassionate use"" allows someone with a serious of life-threatening disease to ask a drug company for a trial drug. Companies often say yes, but pharmaceutical companies often say no, as Chimerix did at first to Josh.“What’s been lost sight of is how we’ve been working. We, a small 50-person company at Chimerix, have been working very hard to make this drug available to Josh and other patients in need,” said Kenneth Moch, Chimerix president and CEO.Josh is at St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Memphis.

917	Josh Hardy will soon receive an experimental drug from pharmaceutical company Chimerix that doctors say will save the ailing 7-year-old’s life. (Hardy Family)A small North Carolina pharmaceutical company has agreed to provide an ailing 7-year-old boy with medicine that could save his life.Chimerix announced yesterday that the company is starting a new trial and Josh Hardy will be the first patient to participate.Josh’s parents Todd and Aimee Hardy received a call from Chimerix president and CEO Kenneth Moch a half-hour before the news was released to the public, according to CNN.Aimee Hardy expressed her overwhelming elation in a poignant message on her personal Facebook page: “Glory to GOD! They’re releasing the drug for Josh!”Moch originally refused the Hardy family’s compassionate-use request for its experimental drug Brincidofovir, saying that providing the medication to patients would slow down the Food and Drug Administration’s approval process.At 9 months, Josh was diagnosed with a rare cancer that effects only 15 kids a year. As a result of his treatments, he developed a bone marrow disorder and last year he underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. These treatments led to more complications and in January he was admitted to the ICU for heart failure. Five days later he was put on a ventilator.Just when Josh was improving, his body became plagued by an adenovirus and doctors treated him with a medicine that damaged his kidneys. His medical team recommended switching to an antiviral medication called Brincidofovir that miraculously cleared up adenovirus in other children.But getting Brincidofovir isn’t easy even if you have health insurance. The drug manufactured by Chimerix is in early development stages and unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Hardy family had to file a compassionate use request with the company asking for the experimental drug. In many cases, companies provide experimental drugs. “The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013,” according to CNN.Chimerix president and CEO Kenneth Moch originally denied the Hardy family’s request saying that if he gave Josh the drug he’d have to help others like him and this would slow down the drug’s approval process.Early in the drug’s development, the company responded to these types of requests but two years ago the CEO decided that his 54-person company needed to stop focusing its efforts on compassionate use requests (which typically cost them $50,000 a patient) and move forward full force on earning FDA approval.The Hardys and their army of supporters wouldn’t taking no for an answer. They started a Change.org petition and launched a Save Josh Facebook page that has over 18,000 fans. Thousands of Tweets flooded the Twittersphere demanding that Chimerax release the drug.Moch was moved and yesterday he opted to make the drug available to Josh and others.“I’m happy for Josh and I’m happy for many patients,” Moch told CNN. “We’ve come up with a way of helping not just Josh, but helping other patients in need, and there are many.”	Health
918	"TrendingJosh Hardy, 7, stole America’s hearts when his parents started an online campaign to save his life after pharmaceutical company Chimerix denied him the life saving drugs he needs. Now, the company has announced that they will help save Josh’s life and provide him the drug he needs.Josh Hardy is a brave little boy who has survived four rounds of kidney cancer, heart failure, and a bone marrow transplant. On March 11, the world learned that Josh was suffering from a viral infection that was slowly taking his life. The only medicine that could save him, Brincidofovir, was denied to him by it’s manufacturer because they claimed it would be too expensive and interfere with getting the drug FDA approved for a wider market.






[hl_ndn videoid=”25692974″]That same day, after receiving what we can only assume were thousands of phone calls, faxes, and emails from Josh’s Army — a group of 19k followers on Facebook — Chimerix announced they would be providing Brincidofovir to Josh within 48 hours for free.[hl_ndn videoid=”25692186″]Doctors at St. Jude’s Children Hospital had originally suggested that Josh try taking trial drug Brincidofovir because it has been proven to clear up adenovirus in children within just two weeks. Chimerix denied their request for treatment because manufacturing two weeks of the drug could cost them up to $50,000 of their research  money which is being used to get the drug FDA approved and available to the masses. Because of Josh, the FDA has allowed Chimerix a to launch a 20-patient open-label clinical trial. Josh will be the first patient in the trial.Now that their little boy has a chance at life again, parents Aimee and Todd are extending their gratitude to everyone who got involved and helped convince Chimerix to save Josh’s life. The family has not only spoken out on the Josh’s Facebook page, but they have spoken out to multiple outlets about how grateful they are to the complete strangers who stepped up to fight for their son.“The one thing I would want to share with America is thank you so much for the love and support,” Aimee told Good Morning America on March 12.Before the trial that will hopefully save Josh’s life was announced, Chimerex President and CEO Kenneth Moch released a statement that explained to everyone this situation with Josh is exactly why Brincidofovir needs to approved and available to others without delay.“We all have great compassion for this child,” Kenneth’s statement read. “We spent our lives trying to develop new medications for patients just like Josh. We need to make sure to get this drug available as soon as possible to as many people as possible.”

919	"MEMPHIS, Tennessee -- A drug company has reversed its decision not to give a dying 7-year-old an experimental antiviral drug that doctors say could save his life.Chimerix, a small North Carolina-based pharmaceutical company, on Tuesday decided it would supply Josh Hardy with brincidofovir, a drug that doctors at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital say could get rid of the adenovirus threatening the boy's life. Josh, who has beat cancer four times since he was 9 months old, contracted the virus in February following a bone marrow transplant.CNN reports that he is in heart and kidney failure. Josh vomits blood several times an hour as the virus rages through his body. Josh's mother, Aimee Hardy, expressed excitement on Facebook Tuesday night upon learning of Chimerix's change of heart. ""Glory to GOD! They are releasing the drug for Josh!"" Hardy exclaimed.Chimerix initially denied the Hardy family's request to try the brincidofovir, saying that helping Josh and others who need the medication now would delay efforts to get the drug on the market for everyone. The drug is anticipated to be available by the end of 2016. Josh's family took to the media, social networks and Change.org to seek a reversal of that decision, and thousands of people joined the chorus demanding that Chimerix help the boy. In an AL.com poll, more than 82 percent of respondents said the company should allow him the medication. The pressure from the public appeared to work on Tuesday, when the company announced that Josh would receive the drug as the first patient in a new trial approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The hospital told CNN that it expected receiving the the drug within 48 hours, but warned that the medication's safety and effectiveness in children had not yet been established.""It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,"" the hospital said in a statement. Kenneth Koch, president of Chimerix, told CNN that he hopes the new study helps Josh, as well as other patients. ""I'm happy for Josh and I'm happy for many patients,"" Moch said. ""We've come up with a way of helping not just Josh, but helping other patients in need, and there are many.""AL.com's Ike Morgan talks about what's going on in our state. Listen on:

FDA has committed to work expeditiously with Chimerix on the design of a pivotal Phase 3 study that would be a continuation of this pilot study. Josh Hardy's story brought to public attention the often-devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix regarding the need for additional clinical development to assess brincidofovir's potential in adenovirus infection.

Due to his predicament, doctors asked the company Chimerix to help provide the medication brincidofovir for the study.Though the company initially turned down the doctors' request-stating that if they gave Hardy the experimental drug, they would also have to do so in similar cases, they changed their minds. ""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir,"" the company's president and CEO, Kenneth Moch said according to USA Today.The company decided to provide brincidofovir to the young boy. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the company's new plan is to provide the drug to 20 patients, with Hardy being the first. At this time, the drug will be sent over to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. within a 48-hour-period.""This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children. ... It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,"" the hospital stated.The family has expressed their gratitude for all the help, noting, via their Facebook Page: ""You did it.

This company probably made billions of dollars in profit in just the last year alone, their CEO and other executives are probably taking multi-million dollar bonuses…but $50k out of their record breaking profits is too much to save the life of a child.  It is disgusting.  and even sadder that they had to be badgered into doing the right thing.  When CNN posted the story their blogs turned into a beehive, Chimerix pharmaceuticals caved in real fast.

Seven-year-old Josh Hardy survived a rare form of kidney cancer that he was diagnosed with at 9 months old. He has since beat cancer in his thymus, lung and bone marrow. But now he is in critical condition as an acute infection ravages his body. He is in heart and kidney failure, he is vomiting blood hourly; the prognosis is grim.

Doctors say that the only thing that can save him is an experimental antiviral drug, brincidofovir; but the pharmaceutical company that makes the medicine, Chimerix, had steadfastly denied the request to help save the boy’s life, according to CNN.

But Josh's mom, Aimee Hardy, was taking no for an answer. She created a Facebook page, gathered supporters and started a mini-revolution. After tireless campaigning by the family and the supportive troops known as Josh's Army, Chimerix has reversed the outcome. The company announced on Tuesday that Josh will receive the medicine and become the first patient in a new trial for the drug.

Josh's father, Todd, said that Chimerix President Kenneth Moch phoned him just before the company made the announcement.

""It was wonderful,"" Todd said. ""Truly wonderful. It was overwhelming.""

Aimee concurred. ""Glory to GOD!"" she wrote on Facebook. ""They are releasing the drug for Josh!!!!!!!!!""

Although the medicine has not yet been established for use in children, the FDA will allow its administration through a policy known as ""compassionate use,"" which paves the way for someone with a serious or life-threatening disease to solicit a drug company for an experimental drug. The FDA approved approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in 2013, but pharmaceutical companies have no obligation to comply. Chimerix has had more than 80 requests for brincidofovir thus far.

The company had said that helping Josh would take resources away from developing the drug – the cost would be $50,000 – and would slow down efforts to get the drug on the market, but company officials seemed pleased with the change of heart.

""I'm happy for Josh, and I'm happy for many patients,"" said Moch. ""We've come up with a way of helping not just Josh, but helping other patients in need, and there are many.""

St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., where Josh is in intensive care, said on Tuesday that they expect to receive the medication within 48 hours.  

""We’re just looking forward to the great success of the drug and the great success of the company to help other people,” said Josh’s mom on Wednesday morning. “Just tremendously excited.”

This story broke my heart the other day. 7 year old Josh Hardy has been battling cancer since he was only 9 months old. It started with a rare form of kidney cancer then over the years, the cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow.Now at the age of 7, Josh was given a bone marrow transplant which left him without much of a immune system. Then in February he was diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread throughout his body.Then St Jude knew of a drug called CMX001 that would help him fight off this virus, but the drug company Chimerix denied them access. After begging and pleading with the drug company and having the media go after Chimerix, they finally changed their mind. The drug makers decided yesterday that they will give the drug to help save Josh. At this point they will try anything to save him. You can see this little boy is dying and his family, friends, and St Jude are trying everything they can to make him feel better. I also read that he has been puking blood for the last couple days. They are hoping this is a miracle drug that will help Josh survive. He's been through so much since he was born but he has so much love and support on his side. My thoughts and Prayers are with Josh and his family. SAVE JOSH!

930	"Seven-year-old Josh Hardy made headlines when drug manufacturer Chimerix refused to donate an antiviral drug - still in the experimental phase - to the cancer-stricken child. However, the company has now reneged on its original decision, announcing Tuesday that Josh would form part of a new pilot study where he would be required to test the medication. Josh will be the first of 20 patients involved in the study. A Facebook campaign (#Savejosh) saw thousands of supporters rising to the occasion, putting pressure on Chimerix to donate brincidofovir to Josh. The drug is still undergoing clinical trials and is yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), hence the need for the donation on compassionate grounds by the manufacturer. However, 'compassionate grounds' proves to be a difficult and morally fraught scenario for drug manufacturers, who believe that giving the drug to one patient opens floodgates to all patients with similar conditions. In the case of brincidofovir, its effectiveness and safety haven't yet been verified in children, leaving the company with several initial reservations about giving it to Josh. Josh, a four-time cancer survivor, requires the antiviral due to a bone marrow transplant that left him with an attack of adenovirus infection, with the child suffering from serious heart and kidney failure. Ken Moch, CEO of Chimerix, explained the process of a compassionate donation, saying that his company has not participated in such a program for some two years. ""Making an experimental drug, which currently has limited clinical evidence, available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail our ability to make brincidofovir available as soon as possible to the thousands of patients each year who might benefit from it,"" Moch told PEOPLE Magazine. ""This is why we are focused on demonstrating the safety and efficacy of brincidofovir in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial.""In deciding to allow Josh access to the drug, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, where Josh is being treated, has urged his family and supporters to remain realistic about the results. ""This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children,"" the hospital said in a statement.

931	 WASHINGTON — Josh Hardy, the Fredericksburg first-grader who is battling a possibly life-threatening virus, will receive the drug that may save him.  The Free-Lance Star reports that Hardy, who is at the St. Jude Children’s Research Center in Memphis, Tenn., will be given the drug to fight the adenovirus he developed after a bone-marrow transplant as a cancer treatment.  The drug that might save him, called Brincindofovir, has not been approved by the FDA, but the drug-maker Chimerix, after consulting with the agency, has set up a new clinical trial.  “We have been working aggressively and intimately with the FDA for a long period of time,” Kenneth Moch, the president and CEO of Chimerix, told The Free Lance-Star on Tuesday.  Moch told the Free-Lance Star that the company had already been negotiating with the FDA, but couldn’t tell anyone because they didn’t want to raise hopes.  Josh’s grandmother Mae Staton told NBC Washington she was ecstatic when she heard the news.  “We were all so excited. I screamed when I heard the news from my daughter,” Staton told NBC Washington.   Staton says the drug is the last hope for Josh.  “[The doctors] said without this drug, that Josh could not survive,” she told NBC Washington.  Aimee Hardy, Josh’s mom, let the supporters know about the good news on her Facebook page.  “Glory to GOD. They are releasing the drug to Josh!!!!!” Amy wrote, according to the paper.  Josh may get the drug as early as Wednesday.  Watch the NBC Washington report below:    Follow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.Need a break? Play a quick game of solitaire or Sudoku.

 announced late Tuesday it reached a pact with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use the drug to treat adenovirus infections like the one afflicting Josh, a Fredericksburg, Va. boy whose immune system has been battered by four bouts with cancer.Chimerix said it will begin testing with Josh on Wednesday using its medication, Brincidofovir, in what will be considered a Phase 3 study. The company said in a press release that Josh’s case accelerated discussions with the FDA to further test the drug.Josh’s case was brought to light Tuesday by reports that pointed out Chimerix had received hundreds of requests to obtain the drug for “compassionate use” on patients that needed them in life-saving procedures. Chimerix Chief Executive Kenneth Moch said the company was reluctant to make the drug available to Josh for fear it would open the floodgates for others who sought the medication and hamper its efforts to get Brincidofovir to market by 2016.“This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix’s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need — for everyone,” Moch said in a press release. “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of Brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.”The decision to undertake a study that would include the boy worked wonders on the company’s stock in trading Wednesday morning.

936	"Social HealthSince Thursday, thousands of people have been begging a drug maker through countless emails, phone calls, and social media, asking for medication on behalf of an ailing 7-year-old cancer survivor named Josh Hardy.While the young boy from Virginia has managed to overcome cancer, he is still suffering from a life-threatening infection that many believe can be treated if only the medication was made available.The Hardy family’s plea to gain access to the necessary drugs for Josh Hardy has inspired thousands of compassionate individuals to beseech the drug maker Chimerix on his behalf, requesting they distribute an otherwise unapproved drug, an antiviral called brincidofovir.
@chimerix where is your compassion? Please approve the use of this experimental drug for little #JoshHardy.— Rachel Adams (@racheladams63) March 11, 2014

@chimerix As a pharmaceutical company, you are devoted to patients. Please release the drug to #JoshHardy. Do the right thing.— B. Marshall (@greencoffin72) March 11, 2014
Unfortunately, the North Carolina-based company, who makes the drug, says it can’t distribute the experimental antiviral to Josh Hardy as it could jeopardize the drug’s approval process, further delaying the availability of the drug for others.In the United States, it takes an average of 12 years for an experimental drug to travel from the laboratory to your medicine cabinet – and that’s if it passes preclinical testing, human trials, and meets FDA regulator’s standard of quality control, explains Medicine Net.In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) governs this process. The FDA requires the following sequence of events before approving a drug:Thereafter, the drug continues to filter through additional months, even years, of a regimented process of applications and testing before it is ever made available on the market. Therefore, delays in the process can be costly, both monetarily and time-wise.However in the case of Josh Hardy, his family says he needs the unapproved medication being made by Chimerix now in order to fight off a viral infection he picked up after a recent bone-marrow transplant.Josh’s parents, Todd and Aimee Hardy are urging supporters, on social media and in the news, to pressure the company to provide brincidofovir to their son. The company has already turned down multiple requests from the boy’s doctors, reports USA Today. Still people continue to contact Chimerix, imploring them to make the drug available to Josh.But the case illustrates the ethical, medical and financial dilemmas that surround compassionate use – the use of medications that have not been approved by the FDA, but are in earlier stages of development.FDA rules do allow companies to provide such drugs to some patients under certain circumstances. KTLA explains. According to the Food and Drug Administration, if someone has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they’re still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA.While representatives for the company voice being sympathetic for the Hardy’s plight, they continue to refuse, citing that alongside not meeting certain criteria for compassionate use, if they did give Josh Hardy the meds they’d be obligated to dole out the drug to other similar patients. This would drain the company of the resources it needs to complete a formal study of the drug, seek FDA approval and potentially help many more future patients.[Photo Credit: KTLA Facebook]Megan Charles is a general news and health-focus writer with a background in medicine and biotechnology.

937	"Home > Drugs/TherapyAfter thousands of people petitioned a drug manufacturing company based in North Carolina to provide a potentially life-saving drug to an ailing seven-year-old boy, the company has decided to comply.The patient, Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, VA, is suffering from an adenovirus infection that manifested after a bone marrow transplant. The young boy is a four-time cancer survivor and after the bone marrow transplant, his immune system was too compromised to fight off the infection. Due to this predicament, his doctors had asked the company, Chimerix to provide the medication, brincidofovir, outside of a study setting.

The company initially turned down the doctors' request. They stated that if they agreed to give Josh the experimental antiviral drug, they would have to provide the drug for other similar cases. By providing the drug without any approval, the company expressed concerns about losing resources that could be used for clinical trials that would help get the drug approved and distributed to more patients.""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir,"" the company's president and CEO, Kenneth Moch said according to USA Today.After Josh's family took to social media to gain support, Chimerix changed its course and decided to provide brincidofovir to the young boy. The drug will be sent over to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, TN within 48 hours. The company's new plan, which has already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is to provide the drug to 20 patients. Josh will be the very first.""This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children. ... It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,"" the hospital stated.It added, according to CNN, ""St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients. We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.""On the family's Facebook Page, they had expressed their gratitude and wrote, ""You did it. You Saved Josh.

939	Utah People's PostThe Latest News from the Beehive StateMarch 12, 2014 Posted by Contributor Pharmaceutical company Chimerix Inc has struck a deal with U.S. regulators to provide an unapproved medicine to treat a 7-year-old boy in Virginia who is suffering from a fatal viral infection.Kenneth Moch, Chimerix President and Chief Executive, said in a statement on Tuesday, “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value.”The announcement comes after the company, Chimerix faced intense media scrutiny and was criticized for denying the medication brincidofovir to the ailing boy.Josh Hardy, a 7-year-old child, developed a bone marrow disorder as a result of his cancer treatments late last year. Hardy remains in a critical condition in ICU at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

Experimental Drug Will be Given to Young Boy: Drug Company
ADHD Drug Use By Young Adults Doubled in Recent Years: Report
Cost of New Hepatitis C Drug Too High: Experts

Please note: This article was published more than one year ago. The facts and conclusions presented may have since changed and may no longer be accurate. And ""More information"" links may no longer work. Questions about personal health should always be referred to a physician or other health care professional.Here are some of the latest health and medical news developments, compiled by the editors of HealthDay:Experimental Drug Will be Given to Young Boy: Drug CompanyA drug company has changed its mind and will give a 7-year-old boy an experimental drug that could save his life.Chimerix announced Tuesday that Josh Hardy will be the first patient in a new trial of the drug brincidofovir that's scheduled to start Wednesday, CNN reported.Josh's parents and supporters had waged online and media campaigns to persuade Chimerix to provide the drug to the young boy, but the company had refused until now. Josh has battled different forms of cancer since he was 9 months old.A bone marrow transplant left Josh with a severely weakened immune system and he was diagnosed in February with an adenovirus that spread through his body. He has heart and kidney failure and is in critical condition, CNN reported.A statement released Tuesday by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis said the medication for Josh was expected to arrive there within 48 hours.""It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,"" the hopsital noted in the statement, CNN reported.-----ADHD Drug Use By  Young Adults Doubled in Recent Years: ReportA new report says that the number of young American adults, ages 26 to 34, receiving drug treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) nearly doubled between 2008 to 2012, from 340,000 to 640,000.It also found that the total number of American adults taking ADHD drugs rose 53 percent during that time, from about 1.7 million to 2.6 million, The New York Times reported.The use of ADHD medications by children increased 19 percent over the four years. In 2012, 7.8 percent of boys and 3.5 percent of girls ages 4 to 18 were being prescribed the drugs. The rates among youngsters ages 12 to 18 were 9.3 percent for boys and 4.4 percent for girls.The report was to be released Wednesday by Express Scripts, the nation's largest prescription drug manager. The findings are from an analysis of 400,000 people nationwide, ages 4 to 64, who filled at least one prescription for an ADHD medication from 2008 to 2012, The Times reported.The findings show that ADHD is being over-diagnosed and treated in children, and that the same situation could occur in adults, according to some experts. The report should prompt discussions about finding solutions to the problem, said Dr. Lawrence Diller, a behavioral pediatrician in Walnut Creek, Calif.""How long will experts' heads remain in the sand on this epidemic?"" Dr. Diller said in an interview with The Times.Other experts believe the sharp rise in the use of ADHD drugs by adults is due to increased awareness that the disorder isn't limited to children. Some studies suggest that about 10 million American adults have ADHD, which means that the use of drugs to treat the condition in adults will continue to rise.""We still know that a majority of adults with ADHD are untreated,"" Dr. Lenard Adler, director of the adult ADHD program at NYU Langone Medical Center, told The Times.-----Cost of New Hepatitis C Drug Too High: ExpertsSome health care experts are questioning whether a recently-approved hepatitis C drug is worth $1,000 a pill.The price set for Sovaldi by manufacturer Gilead Sciences Inc. makes it a ""low value"" treatment in comparison to the cost of using older drugs, the California Technology Assessment Forum voted Monday, the Associated Press reported.Using Sovaldi instead of current hepatitis C drugs would boost California's drug costs by $18 billion to $29 billion a year, according to the fourm, which is an insurance industry-associated group that gauges the cost and effectiveness of new treatments.A final report on Sovaldi is expected to be released by the forum next month, along with its conclusions about another new hepatitis drug called Olysio, from Johnson & Johnson.Sovaldi, which was approved late last year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is taken once a day and cures between 80 and 90 percent of patients. Previous standard treatments for hepatitis C required taking up to 12 pills a day, which is effective in about 75 percent of patients, the AP reported.While Sovaldi was enthusiastically received by doctors due to its convenience and better results, some health providers and patient groups are starting to question its cost. A 12-week course of the drug costs $84,000, and some patients need to take two courses.State Medicaid providers should deny coverage for the drug until Gilead lower the price, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation said in January. It said that the drug's price ""will unnecessarily drive up health care costs and limit access to potentially lifesaving care,"" the AP reported.""AHF believes that the price Gilead is charging for Sovaldi is not remotely justified. For one, it is exponentially more expensive than medications for other severe chronic conditions,"" the group said.For example, the cost of Sovaldi is 1,100 percent more than the $80 per pill that Gilead charges for its most costly HIV drug, Stribild, according to the foundation.Gilead provides financial assistance to patients who aren't able to afford the drug and related insurance costs, a company spokeswoman told the AP. She added that many private insurers are already covering the drug.Last Updated: Mar 12, 2014Copyright © 2014 HealthDay. All rights reserved.Copyright ©2018 HealthDay. All rights reserved."	Health

945	"A potential cure dangles out of reach while a child suffers from a fatal illness -- and it takes thousands of people to turn everything around. A drug company will give medication to a dying 7-year-old boy thanks to a Facebook campaign. Josh Hardy is a cancer patient who contracted an adenovirus infection after a bone marrow transplant. His doctors pleaded with drug company Chimerix for an untested antiviral drug called Brincidofovir, but the company refused. So Hardy's mother turned to social media.The drug bricidofovir is in clinical trials, but under the FDA's compassionate use rules, unapproved drugs can be used outside of trials under certain circumstances. The drug company Chimerix originally told doctors that Josh didn't qualify for those trials, and that if they answered every request for exceptions, it would strain their resources. Imagine the feelings of desperation Josh's mother must have felt when they were refused again and again. What would you do?Josh's mother Aimee set up a Facebook page called Save Josh. They created petitions on Change.org and on the White House petition page. They attracted media attention. Josh's sweet face was everywhere -- the face of an innocent child who would die because a faceless drug company said no.Finally, Chimerix agreed to release the drug to Josh Hardy's doctors. Hardy is one of 20 other patients in a new trial for the drug. Aimee poured out her thanks in a Facebook post. ""Thank you to every member of Josh’s Army. The world has heard you and because of you Josh and many others will have the opportunity to receive CMX001 (Brincidofovir) the life saving antiviral drug made by Chimerix.""It's not over for Josh. There is no guarantee that Brincidofovir will save his life. He could still die from the infection. But at least now he has a chance. And thanks to Aimee's relentless efforts, 20 other people also have a chance at recovery as well.Can you see why Cimerix refused requests from Josh's doctors at first? Image via Facebook

946	A Virginia family has apparently won its Internet campaign to persuade a pharmaceutical company to share its experimental, antiviral drug with them to save their 7-year-old son, who has cancer.  The campaign to get the drug, called brincidofovir, to treat an adenovirus developed by Josh Hardy after a bone marrow transplant had attracted nearly 24,000 Facebook followers.  The manufacturer, Chimerix of Durham, N.C., informed PEOPLE on Tuesday evening that it had worked out a deal with the FDA to initiate a new study of the effects of brincidofovir on the adenovirus – beginning Wednesday with Josh Hardy.   “Josh Hardy s story brought to public attention the often devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix regarding the need for additional clinical development to assess brincidofovir’s potential in adenovirus infection,” Chimerix announced Tuesday afternoon. “This study is expected to begin with Josh Hardy as the first patient enrolled on Wednesday, March 12.”  It was unclear how many other patients would join the expanded study. In recent years, hundreds have expressed an interest, Chimerix says.  Josh’s mother, Aimee Hardy, was ecstatic.  “We are so relieved and grateful that government [the FDA], a corporation [Chimerix], the medical community [St. Jude’s] and individuals were able to come together to develop a solution that would give Josh a chance, while also providing the opportunity to many others to receive potentially lifesaving treatment,” Hardy told PEOPLE in a statement Tuesday. “This is such a wonderful example of the good that can happen when committed people come together to find a positive solution to an agonizing situation. We are very appreciative to everyone who put tremendous effort and thought into making this happen.”  According to Chimerix’s website, 86 percent of subjects in clinical trials were successfully treated with brincidofovir for the adenovirus; in two-thirds of the subjects, the virus became undetectable within the first week.   But without being part of a clinical study such as the one Josh Hardy is about to join, his family was trying to get Chimerix to share the drug for compassionate use. And that’s an area that the pharmaceutical industry approaches with caution.  In an interview with Fox News in the days before Tuesday’s announcement, Chimerix CEO Ken Moch said the company “made the decision two years ago to stop the [compassionate use] program and focus resources on earning FDA approval.”  “Making an experimental drug, which currently has limited clinical evidence, available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail our ability to make brincidofovir available as soon as possible to the thousands of patients each year who might benefit from it,” Moch explained in a statement to PEOPLE. “This is why we are focused on demonstrating the safety and efficacy of brincidofovir in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial.   Chimerix spokesman Tony Plohoros says that the company’s goal is to get brincidofovir to the market by 2016. He says that, when it comes to compassionate use, Chimerix has been following principles laid out by the Biotechnology Industry Organization, which says that “a patient’s right to treatment based on his or her autonomous decision-making ability does not supersede a company’s ethical responsibility to develop and market safe and effective products as fast as possible.”  He points to a recent article in The New York Times explaining that drug companies are becoming more careful about sharing unapproved drugs.  “If doctors simply let people take untested medicines without going through all the clinical trials, drug companies would most likely never get anyone to enroll in them, never get the data on safety and efficacy for FDA. Approval, and never pass the gateway to big sales,” says the report.  	Health
947	" (CNN) - After days of pleading with drug company executives, Josh Hardy's parents got what they'd been praying for: a chance to get medicine that could help their son survive.			The Chimerix pharmaceutical company said Tuesday that the ailing 7-year-old will receive medicine that doctors hope will help him when he becomes the first patient in a new trial set to start Wednesday.Todd Hardy, Josh's father, said he got the call from Chimerix president Kenneth Moch about a half hour before the public announcement was made.""It was wonderful,"" Hardy said. ""Truly wonderful. It was overwhelming."" In an emotional Facebook post, mother Aimee Hardy praised the company's decision.""Glory to GOD!"" she wrote. ""They are releasing the drug for Josh!!!!!!!!!""The company had previously denied calls from the 7-year-old's family to give him the drug, brincidofovir, arguing that spending the time to help Josh and others like him would slow down efforts to get the drug on the market.Josh's story drew national attention as his parents and supporters pushed the company to change its mind in online and media campaigns.CNN told Josh's story Sunday night, describing his parents' desperate pleas for help from Chimerix.Josh's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body.Now he's in critical condition in an intensive care unit as the virus ravages his body. Josh is in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil.His doctors at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis had also been pushing for the company to provide the drug.In a statement Tuesday, the hospital said it expected to receive the medication within 48 hours, but noted that its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established for use in children.""It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,"" the hospital said. ""St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients. We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.""An FDA policy known as ""compassionate use"" allows someone with a serious or life-threatening disease to ask a drug company for an experimental drug.Though it's called compassionate use, sometimes it feels anything but compassionate.Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013.But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as Chimerix did at first to Josh Hardy.Moch previously told CNN he wouldn't back down from his decision not to give Josh the drug.He said Tuesday that he hopes the new FDA-approved study will help other patients as well.""I'm happy for Josh and I'm happy for many patients,"" Moch said. ""We've come up with a way of helping not just Josh, but helping other patients in need, and there are many.""Over the past two years, the company has received more than 80 requests for compassionate use of brincidofovir from patients like Hardy, according to Moch.Todd Hardy hailed Moch as a hero.""He's a super man. He worked diligently on behalf of everybody,"" Hardy said. ""His integrity was unquestioned. He was utterly professional."" A Facebook page dedicated to the online campaign to help Josh get the medicine posted a thank-you message to supporters Tuesday night.""Thank you to every member of Josh's Army. The world has heard you and because of you Josh and many others will have the opportunity to receive CMX001 (Brincidofovir) the life saving antiviral drug made by Chimerix.

948	"After a media firestorm, a drug company that refused lifesaving medication for a 7-year-old cancer survivor, had a change of heart.Chimerix will start a pilot trial Wednesday for the antiviral drug brincidofovir, with patient Josh Hardy as the program’s first participant, according to Fox News.The Max Cure Foundation, a charity dedicated to researching rare pediatric cancers, offered to pay for the drug, but Chimerix was hesitant.Richard Plotkin, vice chairman of the Max Cure Foundation, told “Fox and Friends” on Tuesday that he had spoken with Chimerex’s CEO, Kenneth Moch.“I told him that we had the $50,000 that I thought he was claiming he needed to supply the drug. He then told me it isn’t about money,” Plotkin said. “He told me it’s all about ethics. I said, ‘Fine, tell me why you will not give [it to] this little boy.’ If he does not get the drug, he will die this week, I’m told.  He said he cannot make an exception.”Moch hung up the phone during the conversation, Plotkin said. The company then issued a statement saying it would provide the drug after all.“This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix’s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need — for everyone,” Moch said. “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.”After several battles with cancer, Josh had developed a potentially deadly virus, Fox News reported, adding:Over the course of his childhood, Josh has survived four bouts of kidney cancer and even suffered from heart failure.  Then, in November 2013, he developed a bone marrow disorder as a result of his cancer treatments and underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Though his treatments were a success, Josh subsequently developed adenovirus – an acute infection that can be deadly in people with compromised immune systems.Josh’s mother, Aimee Hardy, launched a grassroots campaign aimed at Chimerix, and soon after the hashtag #savejosh was trending on Twitter and spreading through social media.Watch Tuesday’s report via Fox and Friends:

March 14, 2014 update: Since this article was published, Chimerix has provided Brincidofovir to Josh Hardy as the first patient in its new open-label study in patients with adenovirus infections.As seven-year-old Josh Hardy lies in a bed in St. Jude’s Hospital in Memphis, a drug maker is refusing to give him the medicine that could potentially save his life.Hardy is currently in an intensive care unit because of a virus that is causing heart and kidney failure, CNN reported on Tuesday. The medicine he needs, called Brincidofovir, is not yet available to the public.Chimerix, the drug’s manufacturer, isn’t refusing the boy the medicine because it’s caught up in red tape. In fact, the FDA has approved the use of experimental drugs or drugs not yet available on the public market among critically-ill patients. Instead, the company says it cannot give Josh the drug because of the volume of requests it would receive if they helped one, well-publicized patient.“If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,” Kenneth Moch, Chimerix’s president, told CNN. “But it’s yes to all or no to all.”That does little to comfort the Hardy family, who are pleading for Moch’s help.“Our son will die without this drug,” Todd Hardy, Josh’s father, told CNN. “We’re begging them to give it to us.”Chimerix is in the final stages of getting Brincidofovir to the market by the end of 2016, CNN reported, and if they devote too much time to what are known as “compassionate use” cases, it could actually slow the process of getting FDA approval. The idea here is that giving drugs to save just a few lives now will hurt the lives of others down the road by impeding the FDA-approval process, which is critical to saving many more lives.Per FDA requirements, Chimerix would specifically have to dole out “$50,000 per compassionate-use patient, since insurance doesn’t usually pay for experimental drugs, Moch said. And perhaps even more important than the money, it would divert manpower in this 50-person company, since they’d have to handle the requests and then get the patient’s records and follow up with them, as required by the FDA,” the CNN report explained.(Click to expand) Facebook photo of Josh Hardy.The greater problem with compassionate use cases lies in ethical and medical dilemmas facing patients and their relatives, who also have to tackle the financial burden of health care costs.According to medical ethicist Arthur Caplan, a professor at New York University Langone Medical Center, it’s not difficult to reason with both sides in this case, USA Today reported on Monday. Given that Chimerix is small company, they don’t have the resources or investor stability to do more ad hoc compassionate use cases.“I have huge sympathy for the family,” he told the newspaper. “I think they are right to try and see what they can get for their child.”On the flip side, for Chimerix, “dedicating staff, time and money to compassionate-use requests can slow down a push for a drug’s approval,” Caplan told USA Today, “and expose a company to added risks if people end up harmed by their experimental drugs outside of formal trials.”A campaign of people informally dubbed “Josh’s Army” have been lobbying Chimerix’s Twitter account with hundreds of tweets meant to convince the drug maker to help the young boy. From 2009 to 2012, the company gave out Brincidofovir to 451 patients, CNN said, but that was during the drug’s research and development phases.Unfortunately, even with the Hardy family’s pleas for help, Moch hasn’t changed his mind, the report said. He feels “horrible” about the whole situation, the cable network lamented.Since Thursday, “thousands of people have e-mailed, called or otherwise contacted Chimerix to ask the company to make their drug available to Josh,” Moch told USA Today.“We have have great compassion for this family,” Moch explained to USA Today. “But this is not just about a single boy.”The family has taken their efforts to change the company’s mind to social networks, with a Facebook page titled “Save Josh” garnering more than 18,000 followers.Josh has already survived four cancer diagnoses, along with a bone marrow transplant, which left his body susceptible to the virus that is currently taking over his body’s organs, CNN continued.Pingback: Chimerix board member blames FDA for 7-year-old Josh Hardy’s plight – Fox News | Health News()Pingback: Pharmaceutical Drug Company Will Give Experimental Medicine to 7-Year-Old – Guardian Liberty VoicePharmaceutical Business News UK | Pharmaceutical Business News UK()The recent devastating car bombing in Mogadishu has been blamed by Somali officials on the terrorist group al-Shabab. But the violence (and famine) that have beset Somalia have deeper roots — decades of imperialism and intervention, and use of Somalia as a staging grounds for the “war on terror.”Buried among statistics on gun profits and lobbying efforts is the terrifying reality of just how unique America’s gun obsession and associated violence are. And the equally terrifying plan by the NRA to “normalize” gun possession in nearly every nook and cranny of American life.U.S. campaigns for regime change characteristically focus on the “madness” of the “dictators” to be toppled. In the case of North Korea, the narrative is spiced by the country’s developing nuclear capabilities — which North Korea views as its main line of defense against . . . regime change.Aung Su Kyi, the leader of Myanmar, has been accused of “legitimizing genocide” against the country’s Rohingya Muslims, despite being a Nobel Prize laureate.

951	"(FoxNews)  A pharmaceutical company that produces medication needed to save a dying 7-year-old boy will begin a pilot trial for the drug – with the child to be the program’s first patient beginning on Wednesday, the firm said Tuesday night.The announcement comes after the company, Chimerix, faced intense media scrutiny after it reportedly denied the medication brincidofovir to Josh Hardy, a Fredericksburg, Va. boy who developed a bone marrow disorder as a result of his cancer treatments late last year.At one point, CEO Kenneth I. Moch had been accused of hanging up in a phone call from a representative from a charity that had offered to pay for the medication.However, Moch said in a statement Tuesday night that the company would provide the much-needed drug.“This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix’s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need — for everyone,” Moch said. “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.”Through a grassroots campaign launched by Josh’s mother, Chimerix had received hundreds of phone calls and emails in support of Josh, and the hashtag #savejosh had been trending on Twitter. Supporters even chartered buses so they could protest at the company’s headquarters.Although support for Josh is strong, Hardy’s mother, Aimee Hardy, has said her son is running out of time.“It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him,” Hardy told Fox News. “But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery.”Filed in: News

952	"Seven-year-old Josh Hardy has beaten cancer four times in his young life, but a rare virus is threatening his already weakened immune system. His family can't get their hands on the only experimental treatment that might help him because a drug company, Chimerix, won't release it outside of clinical trials, CBS affiliate WTVR in Richmond, Va. reports.While it's unclear that the drug, brincidofovir, will definitely help, the family and St. Jude Children's Hospital have said it might be the boy's only hope.""This virus has really done a number on his little body, he's bleeding internally and he's in a lot of pain,"" his grandmother Mae Staton told the station.Josh, who's from Fredericksburg, Va., was diagnosed with cancer in his kidneys while he was 9 months old, said Staton, and he's defeated it three more times since. Last November, doctors found something irregular in his blood and determined he needed a bone marrow transplant due to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. It's a tough-to-treat disease of the blood and bone marrow that occurs following chemotherapy or radiation that prevents blood stem cells from maturing into healthy cells, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  Josh was in a coma for 16 days after, his grandmother said, and once he came out of it, he developed a gastrointestinal adenovirus, which is a family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from respiratory infections to fever, diarrhea, pink eye, bladder infections and rashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.People with weakened immune system are at higher risk from getting sick from an adenovirus infection. According to a March 5 letter from Dr. Victor Santana, associate director for clinical research at St. Jude -- which was posted on the ""SaveJosh"" Facebook page -- conventional treatments have not fought off the virus, and the boy's life is in danger.  He wrote that St. Jude approached the North Carolina-based Chimerix Feb. 12 with a compassionate use application for a drug that may help, brincidofovir, but the request was denied. Afterwards, they tried standard treatment but it lead to kidney failure and Josh needed dialysis.Santana expressed concern that after having fought childhood cancer for so long, Josh might succumb to the virus which was increasing in his body.""We respectfully request that given our failed attempts to treat his life-threatening adenoviral infection with the current standard, that you reconsider our request for compassionate use of brincidofovir,"" he wrote. Chimerix has maintained it cannot comply with the request for several reasons, including the fact that there are many other sick children who have also filed compassionate use requests.Company CEO Ken Moch said in a statement emailed to CBS News that the drug is currently being tested in Phase 3 clinical trials to determine its safety and efficacy, and prescribing it outside of clinical trials might derail that process.""Over the past several years Chimerix has received hundreds of requests for the compassionate use of brincidofovir,"" he said. ""Making an experimental drug, which currently has limited clinical evidence, available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail our ability make brincidofovir available as soon as possible to the thousands of patients each year who might benefit from it.""He also told CNN that since insurance doesn't cover compassionate use, the company would have to pay $50,000 for a patient to get the drug. Furthermore, it would divert manpower from his 54-person company to obtain all the patients' records to meet Food and Drug Administration requirements. He said if it was just one patient wanting the drug, it would be a different situation, ""but it's yes to all or no to all.""Meanwhile, Josh's family is continuing to plead their case.""Mr. Moch, have a heart, this child needs to live. Release this drug, so that he can have a healthy, happy life,"" his grandmother said.Ryan Jaslow is CBSNews.com's health editor.

953	"(CNN) — In an intensive care unit in Memphis, a virus ravages the body of a 7-year-old who’s in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil.In a cabinet in Durham, North Carolina, there’s a drug that could likely help Josh Hardy, but the drug company won’t give it to him. They’re adamant that spending the time to help Josh and others like him will slow down their efforts to get this drug on the market.Helping Josh, they say, means hurting others.When asked how he will feel if Josh dies — and he’s in critical condition, so sadly that could happen soon — the president of the company that makes the drug doesn’t hesitate to answer.“Horrible,” said Kenneth Moch. He would feel horrible and heartbroken.But still, he said there’s no way he’s going to change his mind. There’s no way he’s going to give Josh this drug.‘We’re begging them’It’s called “compassionate use,” but sometimes it feels anything but compassionate.Here’s the way it works: According to the Food and Drug Administration, if someone has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they’re still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA.Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013.But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as they did to Josh Hardy.“Our son will die without this drug,” said Todd Hardy, Josh’s father. “We’re begging them to give it to us.”So now, like many families, the Hardys have turned to the media, Facebook, and change.org to pressure the drug company to change its mind.Countless members of “Josh’s army” have responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to “open their hearts,” asking the executives how they can sleep at night.“Everyone is watching,” one tweeter warned the company. Others have tweeted out the e-mail addresses of the company’s board members. Chimerix executives say they’ve received physical threats.Moch, the company president, has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken, but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144-long character debate.At its very simplest, this is it: Chimerix is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone.The company would have to dish out $50,000 per compassionate-use patient, since insurance doesn’t usually pay for experimental drugs, Moch said. And perhaps even more important than the money, it would divert manpower in this 50-person company, since they’d have to handle the requests and then get the patient’s records and follow up with them, as required by the FDA.“If this were just one patient wanting this drug, then this would be a very different question,” he said. “But it’s yes to all or no to all.”From 2009 to 2012, the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients, Moch said, but at least at that time, the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along. But currently doctors don’t really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don’t help get the drug to market.Beat cancer four times Josh’s journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body.They gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys.His doctors at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital said not to give up hope. Since they’d been part of the brincidofovir studies, they’d seen how in sometimes just a week or two, the the oral form of the drug could get rid of an adenovirus without damaging the kidneys. Now all they had to do was ask the company that makes brincidofovir: Chimerix, Inc.On February 12, the St. Jude’s doctors called a Chimerix executive, Dr. Marion Morrison, and asked for permission to use brincidofovir. She said no.On March 5, the doctors asked again. Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive, Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin, who said the company was not “in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources.”‘He holds our son’s life in his hands’Moch wants you to know that he has children of his own, and if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh, he’d be doing the same thing as Todd and Aimee Hardy.“There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they’re going through,” he said.Art Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center, said he feels for both the Hardys and for Moch.“We can’t ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out,” he said.It’s not just the $50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish, Caplan said, but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug. Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug.Perhaps there’s another way to handle compassionate use requests, Caplan suggests. Perhaps a company like Chimerix could agree to give the drug only to the very most dire cases, and put a cap on the number of patients they help.“They might want to open the door a little more broadly,” he said. “They might want to show a little compassion.”But right now, Chimerix stands firm that their compassionate use program is almost completely over.“We’ve had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death, and the answer has been no,” said Mommeja-Marin, the Chimerix executive.But that’s not good enough for the Hardys.“He holds our son’s life in his hands,” Todd Hardy said. “This is just beyond belief to me.”CNN’s John Bonifield, Nadia Kounang and intern Arianna Yanes contributed to this report.Filed in: News BETTER MAKE A EXCEPTION TO THOSE THAT NEED IT!!This company stands to make so much money when the drug hits the shelves I can’t believe that the 50,000 per patient cost is even part of their argumentI am Shocked! SHOCKED I SAY!… not really. Republican/Teabuggery at it’s finest.There’s been an update!

  Seven-year-old Josh Hardy is likely to die soon. 

  The little boy, who has been battling cancer since he was 9
  months old, is in an intensive care unit in Memphis, T.N., where
  his heart and kidneys are rapidly failing him. He vomits blood
  several times an hour as his family gathers around him, bracing
  themselves for the worst but hoping for a miracle (via CNN).

  A miracle, it turns out, might not too far away. In fact, it
  could come in the form a drug called brincidofovir, made by
  the drug company Chimerix in Durham, N.C.

  It's a drug that could save his life.

  But it won't, because Chimerix won't let Josh have it since it
  hasn't been approved by the FDA yet. Giving it to Josh, they say,
  means delaying getting it to other patients who need it,
  too. 

  Sometimes the drug companies do say yes to ""compasionate use""
  requests for their yet-to-be-approved drugs. According to
  CNN, 974
  compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013 were
  approved.

But sometimes they say no, and they've said no to Josh
  Hardy.

Hardy's parents are begging the drug company to change
  their minds.

  When asked how he will feel when Josh dies, Chimerix President
  Kenneth Moch says he'll feel horrible and heartbroken.

  But he's
  still not going to change his mind. 

According to
  Moch, each compassionate use case costs the company $50,000,
  which usually isn't covered by insurance, and requires manpower
  their small company cannot afford to redirect from their other
  efforts.

""Our son will
  die without this drug,"" said Todd Hardy, Josh's father. ""We're
  begging them to give it to us.""

The Hardys
  have taken to Facebook and the media to get their son's story
  out. They've asked people to tweet to drug company @chimerix, telling them
  to ""open their hearts."" 

Members of
  ""Josh's Army"" have been tweeting endlessly, hoping that their
  cries will heed a response:

  Others have tweeted out email addresses of the company's board
  members. CNN reports Chimerix executives say they've received
  physical threats.

  Moch says he has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken,
  but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144-character-long
  debate.

Seven-year-old Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant. But now, he is fighting for his life once again, after a drug company denied him access to a medication that could cure him of a potentially deadly virus.In an attempt to save her son’s life, Josh’s mother, Aimee Hardy, has launched a grassroots campaign to encourage drug manufacturer Chimerix to allow her son to have the medication he so desperately needs.“I want to be by his bedside, holding his hand, telling him, ‘It’s going to be okay,’ but because of this unwillingness to release this drug, I have to leave him and come talk to you and it infuriates me,” Hardy, from Fredericksburg, Va., told Peter Johnson Jr. on Fox and Friends.Josh had been cancer-free for two years when a bone scan in November 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder as a result of his earlier cancer treatments. In January 2014, he underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., but he subsequently developed adenovirus – an acute infection that can be deadly in people with compromised immune systems.“Normally, Josh’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,” Hardy wrote on her son’s CaringBridge.org page. “The challenge is his immune system can’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.”Doctors at St. Jude recommended Josh be treated with Brincidofovir – an antiviral drug that has been proven to clear up adenovirus in children within two weeks.  However, Brincidofovir has not yet been approved by the FDA, so Josh hasn’t been able to gain access to the medication.Chimerix, the company that manufactures Brincidofovir, has given hundreds of patients emergency access to the medication in the past, but they have since stopped this practice saying ‘they cannot afford it,’ according to Johnson Jr.  However, Chimerix has received more than $72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir.“As we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials, we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning FDA approval,” said Kenneth Moch, the CEO of Chimerix.As Josh’s health continues to worsen, the Hardy family has launched a campaign to convince the company to allow Josh to receive the drug through a ‘compassionate use’ program – in which a drug company can allow a seriously ill patient to receive access to an unapproved drug.“I feel that it’s just an excuse and we need them to totally change their stance, not only for us but for hundreds or even thousands of people that need [this drug],” Hardy told Fox and Friends. “…To me, [it’s] almost a crime to not make it available to everyone who needs it.”Moch said his company has received hundreds of phone calls and emails in support of Josh. A Twitter campaign utilizing the hashtag #savejosh has also been launched to support Josh’s cause.However, when Johnson Jr. asked Moch off camera if a visit to Josh’s bedside might help change his mind, Moch said it would not – much to the distress of Josh’s mother.  “He would see a frail little boy who has a very weak voice and has a hard time staying awake, because he’s in so much pain and to combat the pain he has to be on a lot of pain medication, so he’s drowsy,” Hardy said. “It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him. But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery.”To help save Josh, Hardy is encouraging supporters to call Chimerix at 919-806-1074; supporters can also e-mail compassionateuserequest@chimerix.com or tweet @chimerix using the hashtag #savejosh.View AllThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

957	"Various studies have suggested that Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) can make you crazy, narcissistic, miserable and clinically mad. But the social networking site also has a positive impact on users. A new study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and published in PLOS ONE found that the positive status updates on Facebook increases the happiness quotient among your friends.The researchers analyzed over one billion anonymized status updates of more than 100 million Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) users in the U.S. The study was conducted between January 2009 and March 2012. Researchers found that positive posts generate positive posts from friends, and negative ones generate negative posts. But positive posts are more contagious.Lead author James Fowler said that people’s Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) posts cause their friends’s emotional expressions to change. Scientists first proved that rainy days increase the number of negative posts and reduce the volume of positive ones. On a rainy day, the number of negative posts in a city went up by 1.16%, and the number of positive posts fell by 1.19%.Researchers then looked at the friends of rained-in users, but who lived in a different city where weather was absolutely fine. Even these users showed the effects of their wetter friends. For every negative status update from the rainy group, friends in dry weather yielded 1.29 more negative posts. But the positive updates were more influential, generating 1.75 more positive posts.James Fowler said that data shows that emotional expressions spread online, and positive ones spread more than the negative ones. When you go to a restaurant, and you are greeted with a smile, you feel better. Fowler said he believed the study underestimated the impact of social media in spreading your emotional expressions. He said that the growth of social media would lead to a spike in global emotion. That would subsequently create volatility in many aspects of like including financial markets and political systems.Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) shares inched up 0.40% to $71.16 in pre-market trading Thursday.

958	"Support the newsWe already know that cat memes and BuzzFeed lists spread around Facebook quicker than germs in a kindergarten classroom. But can emotions go viral as well?Perhaps, researchers say. When your Facebook friends post happy things online, you're more likely to do so too, according to a study published Wednesday. And the same applies for negative posts: If your friends are being grumpy online, you're more likely to post something negative.Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, analyzed millions of Facebook posts over the course of three years. To gauge how moods traveled across social networks, the researchers looked at the example of rain.""We were literally trying to answer the question: If it rains on your friend in Los Angeles, does it make you a little less happy in New York?"" says James Fowler, the lead researcher and a professor of medical genetics and political science at UCSD.After controlling for things like the average weather in a Facebook user's city, the researchers found that a rainy day increased the number of negative posts that users published on Facebook by a little more than 1 percent.It's a small change,  Fowler tells Shots. But the researchers also found that each sad status posted on a rainy day gave rise to another negative post by a friend living in a city that was dry. Positive moods seemed even more contagious — each happy post typically yielded two additional happy posts by others. The scientists detailed their findings in the current issue of the journal PLOS ONE.To measure how positive or negative the posts were, the researchers used a word classification system called the  Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count.Rain seemed like a good variable because it's essentially random — it tends to fall on happy and sad people in equal measure. Most studies that show a correlation between social interaction and mood can't prove that one causes the other, Fowler says. Positive people, for example, might simply choose to associate with other positive people, and grumpy people might befriend other grumpy people.But this study, he says, found that even a single, isolated rainy day could affect a person's mood — and that mood could be contagious online.Of course, the research only looked at how rain affected the general tenor of Facebook posts. And the effect was fairly small. Fowler says the next step is to look at how specific emotions spread across social networks. He says it's likely the study underestimates how emotion spreads online, since a bit of bad weather isn't the worst that can happen.But the takeaway here, Fowler says, is that social media's influence on mood isn't all bad, despite studies that show young people can pick up bad habits online and that social media use can make us feel sad.You can spread happiness online as well, Fowler says: ""While it's true that there are always people out there who might influence our mood, we also have the capacity to influence other people's mood.""That's something to consider before posting your next rant about this winter's horrid weather.Copyright NPR 2018.Support the news"	Health

Key facts about the couple — like how long were together or when their divorce was finalized — remain a mystery. In fact, only a few things are known about Tikhonova at all, including that she's 31, she's an ""acrobatic rock 'n' roll"" dancer, and she's apparently staggeringly wealthy.Just how wealthy is finally coming into focus, thanks to the divorce. Bloomberg reports that the split reportedly cost Shamalov quite a lot of rubles — over 100 trillion, or nearly $2 billion, worth in stocks to be exact. This is because ""he was only allowed to hold those shares in a kind of trust as a Putin family member,"" Bloomberg explains.Spokespeople for the former couple and for Putin would not speak to Bloomberg about the report.

961	"SAN DIEGO, March 13 (UPI) --  Facebook moods are similar to face-to-face moods, positive posts beget positive posts and negative posts beget negative ones, U.S. researchers say. Lead author James Fowler, a professor at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, and colleagues analyzed more than a billion anonymized status updates among more than 100 million users of Facebook in the top 100 most populous U.S. cities over 1,180 days, from January 2009 to March 2012. The researchers used a software program to measure the emotional content of each post.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
Similar to face-to-face emotions, positive posts were more influential and more contagious, the study found. ""Our study suggests that people are not just choosing other people like themselves to associate with but actually causing their friends' emotional expressions to change,"" Fowler said in a statement.""We have enough power in this data set to show that emotional expressions spread online and also that positive expressions spread more than negative.""The researchers said their findings have widespread implications. Emotions, ""might ripple through social networks to generate large-scale synchrony that gives rise to clusters of happy and unhappy individuals.""As a result, ""we may see greater spikes in global emotion that could generate increased volatility in everything from political systems to financial markets,"" the study said. The researchers also suggested their findings are significant for public well being.""If an emotional change in one person spreads and causes a change in many, then we may be dramatically underestimating the effectiveness of efforts to improve mental and physical health,"" Fowler said. ""We should be doing everything we can to measure the effects of social networks and to learn how to magnify them so that we can create an epidemic of well being.""The findings were published in the journal Plos One.United Press International is a leading provider of news, photos and information to millions of readers around the globe via UPI.com and its licensing services.

963	"You can't catch a cold from a friend online. But can you catch a mood? It would seem so, according to new research from the University of California, San Diego.Published in PLOS ONE, the study analyzes over a billion anonymized status updates among more than 100 million users of Facebook in the United States. Positive posts beget positive posts, the study finds, and negative posts beget negative ones, with the positive posts being more influential, or more contagious.""Our study suggests that people are not just choosing other people like themselves to associate with but actually causing their friends' emotional expressions to change,"" said lead author James Fowler, professor of political science in the Division of Social Sciences and of medical genetics in the School of Medicine at UC San Diego. ""We have enough power in this data set to show that emotional expressions spread online and also that positive expressions spread more than negative.""There is abundant scientific literature on how emotion can spread among people – through direct contact, in person – not only among friends but also among strangers or near-strangers. Little is known, though, about emotional contagion in online social networks. Yet, in our digitally connected world, Fowler said, it is important to learn what can be transmitted through social media, too.Fowler worked on the study with Lorenzo Coviello – a PhD student in the electrical and computer engineering department of the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. Additional coauthors of the paper are: Yunkyu Sohn, political science graduate student at UC San Diego; Adam D. I. Kramer and Cameron Marlow of Facebook; Coviello's graduate advisor, Massimo Franceschetti, also of the Jacobs School; and Nicholas Christakis of the departments of sociology and medicine at Yale University.The researchers analyzed anonymous English-language status updates on Facebook in the top 100 most populous cities in the U.S. over 1,180 days, between January 2009 and March 2012. Researchers did not view any names of users or even the words posted by users. They relied on automated text analysis, through a software program called the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count, to measure the emotional content of each post.To find if there's a causal relationship, the researchers needed to run an experiment. They found a natural one in rain. Rainy weather, it turns out, reliably changes the tenor of posts – increasing the number of negative posts by 1.16 percent and depressing the number of positive by 1.19 percent.Those are small changes but the researchers weren't after big effects. They were looking for a random variable (as rain presumably is) that they could use as an instrument to measure the effect of a change in one user's posts on the posts of their friends. To make sure that rain was not affecting the friends directly, they restricted their analysis to friends who were in different cities where it was not raining, and to make sure it was not topic contagion, they removed from their analysis all weather-related status updates.So, did the change in emotional expression by the people being rained on induce a change in their friends that stayed dry? Yes. According to the study, each additional negative post yields 1.29 more negative posts among one's friends, while each additional positive post yields an additional 1.75 positive posts among friends.If anything, the study probably underestimates how much emotion spreads through a digital social network. ""It is possible that emotional contagion online is even stronger than we were able to measure,"" Fowler said. ""For our analysis, to get away from measuring the effect of the rain itself, we had to exclude the effects of posts on friends who live in the same cities. But we have a pretty good sense from other studies that people who live near each other have stronger relationships and influence each other even more. If we could measure those relationships, we would probably find even more contagion.""The researchers believe their findings have widespread implications. Emotions, they write, ""might ripple through social networks to generate large-scale synchrony that gives rise to clusters of happy and unhappy individuals."" And with ever more avenues for expression in a digitally connected world, they write, ""we may see greater spikes in global emotion that could generate increased volatility in everything from political systems to financial markets.""They also suggest that their findings are significant for public wellbeing.""If an emotional change in one person spreads and causes a change in many, then we may be dramatically underestimating the effectiveness of efforts to improve mental and physical health,"" said Fowler, co-author of the book Connected, ""We should be doing everything we can to measure the effects of social networks and to learn how to magnify them so that we can create an epidemic of wellbeing.""Original release: http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-03/uoc--caf031114.phpView the discussion thread.Advantage Business Media © Copyright 2018 Advantage Business Media"	Health
964	"Lawrence LeBlond for redOrbit.com - Your Universe OnlineSeveral studies have so far pointed out the positive and negative effects social networking has on people. While Facebook has offered millions of people a way to connect and interact in a way that may have not been otherwise possible, the social giant has also been a home for cyberbullying.""Our study suggests that people are not just choosing other people like themselves to associate with but actually causing their friends' emotional expressions to change,"" James Fowler, professor of political science in the Division of Social Sciences and of medical genetics in the School of Medicine at UC San Diego, who is lead author of the study, said in a statement. ""We have enough power in this data set to show that emotional expressions spread online and also that positive expressions spread more than negative.""An abundance of scientific literature exists on how feelings among people can become contagious through direct contact with family, friends and even strangers. Because little is known about the emotional contagion in online social networking, Fowler maintains that his study, and others that may follow, is a good stepping stone in determining what can be transmitted via social media.Working with Lorenzo Coviello, a PhD student in the electrical and computer engineering department at UCSD’s Jacobs School of Engineering, along with several other researchers from UCSD, Facebook and Yale University, Fowler analyzed anonymized status updates from the top 100 most populous US cities over a period of 1,180 days, between January 2009 and March 2012. The team did not view any usernames or words that were posted. Instead, Fowler and his team relied on automated text analysis using a software program known as Linguistic Inquiry Word Count, which measures the emotional content of each post.Then, to determine the causal relationship between posts, the team ran an experiment using a natural element: rain. They found that rainy weather changes the tenor of posts in reliable fashion. Rainy days increased the number of negative posts by 1.16 percent and depressed the number of positive posts by 1.19 percent.Despite the small percentages, the team noted that it wasn’t large numbers they were looking for, but rather showing that a random variable – such as rain – can be used as an instrument in measuring the effect of a change in a user’s posts on another user’s posts. To ensure the rain was not affecting the friends of friends, the team restricted their analysis to friends who lived in different cities where it was not raining. And to ensure that it was not a topic contagion, they removed all weather-related status updates from their analyses.So, the team implies, the change in emotional expression by those experiencing rainy weather did have an effect on their friends who were in dry cities. They found that each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts among a user’s friends, while each additional positive post yielded an additional 1.75 positive posts among friends.The team said that this study likely underestimates how much emotion spreads through a digital social network.""It is possible that emotional contagion online is even stronger than we were able to measure,"" Fowler said.

A new study from America has cast some light on exactly how much negative and positive posts on Facebook affect other users reading them.Moods are contagious on Facebook, researchers from the University of California in San Diego noted, and negative posts produce more downbeat updates from others, whereas positive posts produce the opposite.Or to put it another way – what human beings say affects other human beings. Yes, it is all a bit Ministry of Stating the Bleedin’ Obvious…The researchers do say that it’s a well-known fact that people’s emotions spread in person, but that this isn’t necessarily the case online. We would argue that the latter is pretty patently true, as well – whatever your friends say affects you, whether it’s direct conversation, texts, online updates, or a note tied to a brick through your window.But to be fair, the research is thorough – analysing over a billion updates, across a million users, over a period of three years – and it does pinpoint exactly how much positivity or negativity is triggered by cheery or bleak status updates respectively.The study centred on rain (that familiar catalyst of misery, particularly this winter), and it measured how the tone of status updates changed when it rained. Apparently this has a measurable effect on updates to the tune of an uptick in negative posts by 1.16 per cent if it’s raining, with a slide of 1.19 per cent in positive posts.The scientists then looked at the updates of friends in a different city, but one where it wasn’t raining – and each original negative post trigged an extra 1.29 negative posts among dry-area friends. Each happy post resulted in a boost of 1.75 positive ones.The Guardian notes that James Fowler, professor of medical genetics and political science at the University of California, commented: “To get away from measuring the effect of the rain itself, we had to exclude the effects of posts on friends who live in the same cities. But we have a pretty good sense from other studies that people who live near each other have stronger relationships and influence each other even more. If we could measure those relationships, we would probably find even more contagion.”Sign up below to get the latest from IT Pro Portal, plus exclusive special offers, direct to your inbox!ITProPortal is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

											Rhiannon Williams12:15PM GMT 13 Mar 2014 There's never been a better time to cull constantly-moaning Facebook 'friends', after scientists have found moods and emotions can be transferred to others by sharing your feelings on social networks.  Researchers examined over one billion Facebook status updates from around one million users, and used a word verification system to determine whether the posts contained positively or negatively-associated words. They found positive posts made from cities experiencing rainy days decreased by 1.9 per cent, while negative posts increased by 1.16 per cent.  The study then analysed the posts of users who were friends with those in rainy cities, but who were not being rained on in their location. Every positive update triggered an additional 1.75 happy posts, while downbeat messages tended to be replicated 1.29 times.  For example, the paper estimates that a rainy day in New York directly yields an additional 1,500 negative posts by New York-based Facebook users and about 700 negative posts by their friends elsewhere.  The authors of the report said it confirmed individual expression of emotions depends on what others in an individual's social network are expressing, implying emotions themselves might ripple through social networks to generate clusters of happy and unhappy individuals.

Zee Media BureauWashington: Be cautious while posting updates on your Facebook page as it can have a huge influence on its viewers.A new research has suggested that the posts on your Facebook Wall – both positive and negative feelings, can impact the moods and posts of friends on your list.By analysing over a billion anonymised status updates among more than 100 million users of Facebook in the United States, researchers found that positive posts beget positive posts and negative posts beget negative ones, with the positive posts being more influential, or more contagious.
“Our study suggests that people are not just choosing other people like themselves to associate with but actually causing their friends` emotional expressions to change,” said lead author James Fowler, professor of political science in the Division of Social Sciences and of medical genetics in the School of Medicine at UC San Diego.There is abundant scientific literature on how emotion can spread among people - through direct contact, he added.
The researchers analysed anonymous English-language status updates on Facebook in the top 100 most populous cities in the US over 1,180 days, between January 2009 and March 2012.

973	A good mood really is contagious, even on social media. According to a new study, the mood of your Facebook updates is directly influenced by the moods of those in your newsfeed.The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, Yale, and Facebook, examined statuses on the popular social network with a particularly positive or negative emotional bent, as identified by algorithm. The researchers first proved that rainy days caused fewer positive statuses and more negative ones—even when the program eliminated statuses explicitly about the weather. During a rainy day, they found, a city’s number of negative posts will increase by 1.16%, and positive ones will decrease by %1.19.The researchers then looked at friends of the rained-in parties—but ones who lived in other cities, where the weather was fine. This group was affected by their wetter friends: For every negative post from the rainy group, dry friends posted 1.29 more negative posts than would normally be expected. Positive posts had a slightly stronger effect, inspiring 1.75 more positive posts. “Effectively this means that 1-2 people were indirectly affected,” researcher Massimo Franceschetti told Quartz. Not exactly an epidemic of goodwill, but a notable increase. “We showed,” says Franceschetti, “that social networks can actually magnify and promote social synchrony. This could mean that social networks actually make the world more volatile, because people are more prone to synchronize emotionally with peers around the world.”Contagious emotion isn’t a new idea: “We know that emotions are contagious in a sense,” says Franceschetti. “When you go to a restaurant and you’re greeted with a smile, this makes you feel better. It improves your experience. But isolating this network effect on such a massive scale—with the help of a huge online social network—allows us to measure the contagion more effectively.” The authors hope that knowledge of this effect will inform everything from marketing tactics to acts of good will. “The benefit of a good action can spread,” says Franceschetti. “Providing better care for the suffering could effect numerous others’ happiness as well.”We all expect to have our opinions influenced by peers on social media, and it seems that their moods may sway us as well. If your newsfeed is full of grousers, perhaps it’s time to find new (Facebook) friends.	Health

976	Findings of a large study that analyzed more than a billion status updates uploaded by over 100 million users of Facebook revealed that emotions vented online are contagious.Researchers at University of California, San Diego, found that positive feelings posted online had the tendency to attract positive posts. Likewise negative posts lead to negative reactions.The study also revealed that positive posts were catchier and attracted similar responses as compared to negative posts.“We have enough power in this data set to show that emotional expressions spread online and also that positive expressions spread more than negative,” James Fowler, lead author and professor of political science at University of California, San Diego said.Earlier studies have established that emotions tend to spread not only amongst friends but also amongst strangers.Research MethodologyThe present study, which analyzed Facebook updates over 1,180 days between January 2009 and March 2012, appears to be a pioneering attempt to study the same aspect on an online mode.For the purpose of the study, researchers scrutinized English-language status updates on the world’s most popular social networking site.These posts were taken from top 100 most populous cities in the United States. To ensure confidentiality of the posts, the data was kept on Facebook’s secure servers.The researchers used software called Linguistic Inquiry Word Count to decipher the emotional content of each post.The study found that a negative post had the tendency to yield 1.29 more negative posts while a positive post had the potency to yield 1.75 more positive posts among one’s friends.The study researchers conclude that emotions “might ripple through social networks to generate large-scale synchrony that gives rise to clusters of happy and unhappy individuals”.The findings of the study are important for the overall well being of the society. The researchers opine that we should strive to magnify the positive effects of social networks so that it translates into an “epidemic of wellbeing.”Findings of the study are published in the journal PLoS ONE.

980	"While children are still the main users of ADHD drugs, a new report issued by Express Scripts’ pharmacy claims that data on 400,000 people over a five-year period suggests that the number of adults taking ADHD medications is significantly on the rise, and has increased by 53 percent from 2009 to 2012. Over the same period, the percentage of children taking these drugs also increased by 18 percent.The report also showed that although the number of boys on ADHD medications was twice that of girls taking these drugs, adult women’s use of ADHD medications is starting to surpass men’s. The group that saw the biggest increase in use was women ages 26 to 34. Nearly 3 percent of U.S. women in this group now use ADHD medications, making the percentage of users in this group increase by 85 percent during the course of the study period, according to the report. Although the increase in use was greatest among women ages 26 to 34, researchers found that women between 19 to 25 showed the highest use of ADHD drug treatments.Dr. David Muzina, vice president at Express Scripts, fears that “less-appropriate” uses of the medication may be behind the increase in use by women and that some may use it as an appetite suppressant in an effort to lose weight. Another factor may be that more doctors are prescribing ADHD medication to treat depression.NEXT: Gut bacteria essential for developing immune cellsSourced from: Live Science, Use of ADHD Drugs Increasing Rapidly Among US AdultsNew research from the U.K. has concluded that statins—drugs that act to reduce cholesterol levels in the blood—have fewer side effects than previously thought.The study refutes previous research that has linked statins to many symptomatic side effects, including nausea, fatigue and insomnia.Scientists from Imperial College London conducted a meta-analysis involving 29 randomized controlled trials and more than 80,000 patients. They collected data on the cardiovascular events, fatalities and the following adverse side effects: nausea, renal disorder, myopathy and muscle breakdown, muscle ache, insomnia, fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbance.The findings, published in the European Journal of Preventative Cardiology, showed that, between the group of participants given statins and the group given a placebo, there was no significant difference in the side effects commonly attributed to statins. In fact, some patients taking statins actually experienced fewer adverse symptoms than did patients taking the placebo, according to the researchers.One new risk the researchers were able to identify, however, was the onset of diabetes. The findings suggest that one in five new cases of diabetes may be directly related to statins.As a result of clearer benefits and risks of the drug, the U.K.s National Health Service (NHS) said it plans to draft new guidelines advising men over the age of 50 and women over 60 to take statins, if prescribed by their health care provider, as a precaution to decrease risk of heart attacks and strokes. Health experts said they expect the number of people who take statins to increase from seven million to 12 million.NEXT: Average bride gains four pounds after weddingSourced from: UPI, Meta-analysis finds few side effects from statinsResearchers from Caltech in Pasadena, CA, have published a study in the journal Cell Host & Microbe showing that gut bacteria plays a key role in the development of innate immune cells provide a first line of defense against infections.To conduct their study, the team tested the ability of mice to fight off infection by exposing them to the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, which is harmful to humans and often used in mouse studies of the immune system. They found that the healthy mice recovered quickly after being injected with the bacterium, but the germ-free mice died because they were not able to fight off the infection. However, when the germ-free mice were then given gut bacteria typically found in healthy mice, their white cell count increased, and they survived the infection.In another part of the study, the team gave healthy mice antibiotics to kill their gut bacteria and then injected them with Listeria. Again, they became sick and had trouble fighting off the infection.This study adds to the debate over how to deal with superbugs resistant to antibiotics and whether it’s wise to use antibiotics as a preventative measure against infection in surgery patients.NEXT: Flu Pandemic begins: March 11, 1918Sourced from: Medical News Today, Gut bacteria essential for immune cell development

984	During a four-year span, the use of medication to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder rose not only in children but even more so in adults, according to a new study published Wednesday. Some health professionals went so far to say the disorder has reached epidemic proportions, while others question its classification altogether.The study by Express Scripts Lab evaluated pharmacy claims data between 2008 and 2012, finding the use of medication to treat ADHD rose 36 percent overall. Though children are the primary users of ADHD medications, the study said the number of adults being prescribed with these drugs, which include Ritalin, Adderall and Concerta, rose more than 53 percent in 2012, while it was only at 18.9 percent in 2008.The greatest increase in ADHD drug users was among women age 26 to 34.“How long will experts’ heads remain in the sand on this epidemic?” Dr. Lawrence Diller, a behavioral pediatrician in California, told the New York Times of the study’s findings.ADHD has been increasing for at least 15 years. Experts think that’s because more doctors are looking for ADHD, and more parents know about it. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the results of a survey that found more than 1 in 10 children are diagnosed with ADHD.Some doctors though question whether the disorder is actually valid at all.“This so-called condition has apparently spread like wildfire across the globe in recent years, with a huge increase in its diagnosis and medication,” Dr. Richard Saul, a behavioral neurologist and author of the new book “ADHD Does Not Exist,” wrote.“To treat ADHD as a condition, rather than a set of symptoms, is doing a terrible and dangerous, disservice to the children and adults who are diagnosed with it. There is no doubt that the symptoms — an inability to pay attention to details, fidgeting, interrupting, difficulty staying seated, impulsive behavior — exist,” he continued. “But to lump them together and turn them into a diagnosis of ADHD, then to treat this so-called condition with stimulants, is like treating the symptoms of a heart attack — such as severe chest pain — with painkillers, rather than tackling the cause of them by repairing the heart. It is dangerous, neglectful and wrong.”The biggest takeaway from Express Scripts study is that it isn’t known how these drugs might affect older patients.“There are, however, concerns that less appropriate uses of the medication may be behind the increase in use among women. Stimulant medications are known to decrease a person’s appetite and are sometimes used as a weight-loss aid. Also, some women may turn to these medications, or experience symptoms of attention disorders, as a result of keeping up with the multiple demands on their time,” Dr. David Muzina wrote about the study.“While generally safe for the majority of the population of patients, stimulants prescribed for ADHD come with several serious safety concerns and have an addictive nature. Use of these medications can be dangerous for patients with heart problems and may cause serious interactions with other medications and conditions, like bipolar disorder,” Muzina continued.Some professionals have criticized the studies about the prevalence of ADHD, saying they “overestimate true prevalence” of the disorder.But there’s no denying that that abuse of ADHD medications are on the rise.“As we move forward, we want to make sure that people who have the disorder get the prescription. And that people who don’t have the disorder don’t,” Dr. Lenard Adler, director of the adult ADHD. program at NYU’s Langone Medical Center, told the New York Times.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

985	"By Dr. Sharma Neha, ABC News Medical UnitCan you recall an instance where you just couldn't focus on your work or assignment and felt distracted? Doesn't everyone feel distracted sometimes?For patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., distraction may be long term, and may be an obstacle for success if left undiagnosed and untreated.No one with this disorder chooses to misbehave or lose his or her train of thought. A.D.H.D. is a developmental condition of greater-than-normal inattention and distractibility, with or without accompanying hyperactivity. And it has nothing to do with intellectual ability.A new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study showed that A.D.H.D. is on the rise. The report found that an estimated 6.4 million children ages 4 through 17 have received an A.D.H.D. diagnosis at some point. That's 1 in every 10 children in the United States. And it's a 41 percent increase in the past decade.This week's ABC Health tweet chat, moderated by ABC News chief health and medical correspondent Dr. Richard Besser, highlighted the diagnosis, treatment and management of A.D.H.D.

View Analyst Ratings for Express Scripts.Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Express Scripts stock:
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, ""We are upbeat about Express Scripts’ pharmacy-benefits management long-term outlook. The projection takes the volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration and lower industry utilization growth into consideration. Furthermore, Express Scripts should benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation. Thus, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and overwhelming regulatory burden is opening up considerable prospects for generics. However, over the past one year, Express Scripts has underperformed the broader industry in terms of price. Tough competition in the niche space and the persistent drug pricing issue are anticipated to affect the stock."" (10/24/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, ""We believe ESRX remains a Buy given our view that company fundamentals, including its FCF, are stable and that the stock's valuation is attractive at 9x FY18 P/E. That said, we recognize that headlines surrounding drug pricing pressure and the overhang from ESRX's Anthem contract will drive continued stock volatility NT."" (2/17/2017)

989	"COOL VALLEY, Mo., March 12 (UPI) --  From 2008 to 2012, U.S. adults prescribed medication to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder rose 36 percent, Express Scripts says.Express Scripts, which processes pharmaceutical claims for members via a network of retail pharmacies, analyzed pharmacy claims data from 2008 to 2012 and found the greatest increase in ADHD medication during the five-year study period was among adults. The biggest gain in ADHD medication use was among women ages 26 to 34, which rose 85 percent. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
Children are still the primary users of ADHD medications but the number of U.S. adults on these medications increased at a much faster pace, up 53.4 percent in adults versus up 18.9 percent in children, from 2008 to 2012.Among adults, women far outnumber men in their use of ADHD treatments -- the reverse of childhood trends where only half as many girls as boys take ADHD medications. The number of males using ADHD drugs plummeted after age 18 while women ages 19 to 25 surpass younger girls' use of these medications.The percentage of boys ages 12 to 18 using ADHD medications reached 9 percent in 2012, an 18 percent increase from 2008.The southern region of the United States had the highest concentration of ADHD medication use, with South Carolina showing the greatest prevalence overall: 14 percent of teens ages 12 to 18 were on an ADHD medication treatment in 2012. The rapid increase in adult use of these medications is striking, especially because there is little research on how these treatments affect an older population, Express Scripts said. Since females tend to present the inattentive form of ADHD and do not display disruptive behavior in school, their symptoms may be overlooked in childhood, but less appropriate uses of the medication may be behind the increase in use among women. Stimulant medications are known to decrease a person's appetite and are sometimes used as a weight-loss aid, Express Scripts said.United Press International is a leading provider of news, photos and information to millions of readers around the globe via UPI.com and its licensing services.

Use of the medications grew 85 percent in 2012 from 2008 for women ages 26 to 34, and women 19 and over now outnumber men in use of the medicines, according to the report released yesterday. Boys 12 to 18 years old are the most heavily prescribed, with about 9.3 percent on ADHD drugs in 2012. Almost 4.8 million privately insured people were on ADHD medicines in 2012, the report said. Those with the disorder have problems paying attention, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Drugs to treat it, including Ritalin, Adderal and their generic equivalents, are stimulants. ""The population treated for ADHD has exploded in the U.S., dwarfing its diagnosis and treatment seen in other countries,"" Express Scripts said. Use of the drugs increased among every single age category from 4 to 64, the report found. Express Scripts, based in St. Louis, using a database of 15 million people with private insurance, looked at the claims of more than 400,000 people who filled an ADHD prescription. Females take ADHD prescription drugs at lower rates than boys from ages 4 to 18, then increase from age 19. Some may be taking the medications improperly as a weight-loss aid, or for depression, the report said. More cases needing treatment are being diagnosed, but ""there are a variety of clinical and societal trends that have inflated ADHD diagnoses and drug treatments to questionable levels,"" said the report. ""ADHD has unfortunately become the go-to condition for children with behavioral issues.""    -- Bloomberg NewsThe best of Newsday every day in your inbox.

Could consumer goods companies fill the void left by big pharma?This six-part series, produced by the MM&M; Content Lab in partnership with Klick Health, tells personal stories of people using creativity to solve problems in healthcare.Adults are increasingly turning to Attention Deficit Disorder medications, reports pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts, which surveyed prescription data between 2008 and 2012.The PBM found that ADHD prescriptions have jumped 36% as a whole, but that prescriptions for women between the ages of 26 and 34 have skyrocketed 85%.This uptick may not be surprising, considering the growing number of articles about increasing attention-deficit diagnoses among children and adults. Nor would it surprise the nonprofit Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders, which recently re-upped singer/reality show coach Adam Levine to front its “Own It” adult ADHD campaign. This three-year-old awareness effort (which is in addition to Levine's spokesman work for OTC acne treatment Proactiv) focuses on the need for adults to recognize that they may not have outgrown their childhood ADHD. “If you frequently feel those symptoms as an adult, don't be bashful. Talk to your doctor,” Levine says of ADHD symptoms in a promotional piece by the group.The correlation between advertising and prescriptions, however, is not necessarily direct. Express Scripts notes in its analysis that there “are concerns that less appropriate uses of the medication may be behind the increase in use among women. Stimulant medications are known to decrease a person's appetite.” The company also addresses another reason that these prescriptions could be popular among young adult women—multitasking, or, per the report “women may turn to these medications...as a result of keeping up with multiple demands on their time.”Additional adult trends show that although use has jumped among women, men tend to move away from the medications after the age of 18.Express Scripts notes that “how and why physicians prescribe these medications for adults” requires a closer look.Warc anticipates global adspend growth this year to ring in at a healthy 4.7%, or $572bn (£410bn).Brands should refrain from tweets that are over 100 characters, according to Twitter's director of brand strategy.

995	"A report by prescription processor Express Scripts states that use of medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased significantly in both children and adults. From their analysis of a nationally representative sample of 400,000 individuals ages 4–64 who filled at least one prescription for an ADHD medication from 2008–2012, young adults ages 26–34 nearly doubled their use of ADHD medication, from 340,000 to 640,000 during this time. The total number of American adults taking ADHD drugs also rose by 53%. Use of these medications by children rose less (19%), although some worry that these rates are still too high.The number of young American adults taking medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder nearly doubled from 2008–2012, according to a report to be released Wednesday by the nation's largest prescription drug manager.

	A growing percentage of adults in the United States are taking medications such as Adderall for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), according to a new report by the country's largest pharmacy benefit management organization.
	Although children are still the primary users of ADHD medications, and the percentage of children taking them increased 18 percent between 2008 and 2012, the number of privately insured adults on these drugs has been increasing at a much faster pace, and rose 53 percent over the same time period, according to Express Scripts' pharmacy claims data.
	The total number of privately insured children and adults on ADHD medication is estimated to have been more than 4.8 million in 2012, up 35.5 percent from 2008, according to the report, released today (March 12). [5 Things to Know About ADHD Medication]
	The report also showed that although the number of boys on ADHD medications was twice that of girls taking these drugs, the opposite seems to be true in adulthood: Women's use of ADHD medications is starting to surpass men's. The group that saw the biggest increase in use was women ages 26 to 34. Nearly 3 percent of U.S. women in this group now use ADHD medications — meaning the percentage of users in this group rose by 85 percent over the study period, according to the report.
	""Since females tend to present the inattentive form of ADHD, and do not display disruptive behavior in school, their symptoms may be overlooked in childhood,"" said Dr. David Muzina, vice president at Express Scripts. ""As they age, they may become more aware of their symptoms and consult their physician.""
	""There are, however, concerns that less-appropriate uses of the medication may be behind the increase in use among women,"" Muzina wrote in a commentary about the report. ADHD drugs are stimulants, and are thought to decrease a person's appetite. Some people may use these drugs to help them lose weight, Muzina said.
	It is also possible that some women are being treated with these drugs for depression, Muzina said.
	Although the increase in use was greatest among women ages 26 to 34, researchers found that women ages 19 to 25 showed the highest use of ADHD drug treatments among women.
	ADHD medications can have side effects: They can be particularly dangerous for people with heart problems, and may cause serious interactions with other medications, such as those used to treat bipolar disorder, Muzina said.
	The report is based on pharmacy claims of more than 400,000 people during the five-year study period. Researchers estimated that spending on ADHD medication rose 14 percent in 2012 — the greatest increase seen among any drug category.

997	 Experience us with dark themeAlthough attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly a childhood disorder, it can continue into adolescence and adulthood, affecting one's ability to stay focused, pay attention, and control behavior as well as hyperactivity.Express Scripts, a company that provides and manages prescription benefits for 90 million Americans, released new data today that revealed ADHD prescriptions for adults have increased 53% over the past four years. There was also a 47% increase for prescriptions among children.This report suggests that ADHD is perhaps being overdiagnosed and drugs such as Adderall, Concerta, and Strattera are being overprescribed. But the increase in diagnoses have been occurring for a while now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Between 1997 and 2006, ADHD diagnoses increased at least 3% per year, and at least 5% per year between 2003 and 2011.The issue has affected healthcare and medical costs since these diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions for ADHD contributed between $36 billion $52 billion in costs in 2005. Since then, these costs have increased as diagnoses have become more frequent; 9% of children under the age of 18 and 4.1% of adults are affected by ADHD.The problem could lie within the criteria for diagnosing the disorder. Although the criteria are clear, ADHD shares traits with other mental disorders and conditions, which could contribute to misdiagnoses and inflated numbers. Behavioral therapy is common among children who are thought to have the disease because many doctors don't feel it's necessary to immediately put them on medication. The opposite is the case for adults, where health experts believe drugs should be prescribed to manage symptoms, but it's also important that they undergo some sort of therapy.Sue Visser of the National Centers on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities explains more about ADHD diagnoses in this ABC News article. You can also read more on the Express Scripts data in this Fox News article.TagsADHD, Medication, AdultsJoin the Conversation	Health

A list of the most popular browsers can be found below.A new report shows that prescriptions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have skyrocketed in recent years, especially among adults.The report, by Express Scripts, the nation’s largest prescription drug manager, is likely to widen the debate over whether ADHD is overdiagnosed, and whether medication is prescribed without enough consideration for other forms of treatment.While some experts say the rise in diagnoses is due to an increasing awareness of the disorder, others believe this study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that ADHD prescriptions may be outpacing actual cases of ADHD.The report was based on the pharmacy records of about 15 million privately insured people in the U.S., including 400,000 who filled at least one prescription for an ADHD medication, the most popular of which are stimulant-based drugs like Adderall and Concerta.It found that the number of Americans using prescription drugs to treat ADHD rose 36 percent between 2008 and 2012. And the numbers were even larger for some groups. For women between 26 and 34, ADHD-related prescriptions rose 85 percent. Prescriptions for adults in general went up 53 percent, to an estimated 2.6 million Americans.The rises among children were less steep, but that may be because the rates of prescription were already much higher. In 2012, 5.7 percent of children were prescribed ADHD medication. Some subsets of that group have much higher rates. More than 9 percent of boys aged 12 to 18 were prescribed the drug in 2012, for example.There are many theories as to why prescriptions are on the rise, but most experts say the numbers show two disparate trends. One is that ADHD is becoming more widely recognized as a legitimate diagnosis, and therefore more people are being diagnosed; the other is that ADHD medication has been overprescribed, used as a solution to other issues such as kids’ behavioral problems in school.While the study is likely to add to a growing debate about the use of prescription drugs, experts warn that the overmedication question is a complicated one.“That’s the million-dollar question,” said Paul Morgan, a professor and researcher of diagnosis disparities at Penn State. “You want to be cautious you’re not overdiagnosing, but not so cautious that you aren’t diagnosing people who actually have ADHD.”The report also found some interesting regional trends. The South had far higher rates of ADHD prescriptions than the rest of the country. South Carolina’s ADHD medication prescription use was found to be 72 percent higher than the national average.Joseph Austerman, head of the psychiatry and psychology department at the Center for Pediatric Behavioral Health at the Cleveland Clinic, told Express Scripts that the higher numbers in rural states may be due to the lack of access to behavioral health care providers who can properly diagnose the disorder. Low-income children are also more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, he said.Sign up for our weekly newsletter11 percent of kids between the ages of 4 and 17 were diagnosed with ADHD in 2011, a 42 percent increase from 2003
