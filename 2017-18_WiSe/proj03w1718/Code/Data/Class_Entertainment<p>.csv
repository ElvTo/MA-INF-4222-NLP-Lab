Wearing a bulletproof vest and living in hotels, George Zimmerman took time out from his armed life on the move to sign autographs over the weekend at an Orlando gun shop.Zimmerman told WOFL-TV that even inside a ""secure"" gun store among 200 supporters, he was still concerned about his safety in light of being acquitted in 2013 of murdering Trayvon Martin.""I always stay cognizant of the fact that there are threats,"" he said Saturday at the Arms Room. ""The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn't pass up.""""I walk around armed; I walk around with a bulletproof vest,"" he added. ""It's not so much for my safety as it is so much for those around me.""He doesn't understand why many people are still angry at him.""But I'm willing to talk to everyone and try and answer their concerns or questions, and (have) them realize there's no need to be angry,"" Zimmerman said.Because the U.S. Justice Department is investigating Trayvon's death, he wouldn't talk about the February 2012 killing of the teen, which he said was self-defense under Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. He also wouldn't discuss recent traffic stops, his pending divorce or domestic troubles with a former girlfriend with whom he last lived.Zimmerman did say he has no permanent home, shuttling from hotel to hotel, and has received treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.Monday in Tallahassee, hundreds marched to the state Capitol to call for the repeal of the 2005 stand-your-ground law.""It's a flawed law,"" said Al Sharpton, who was joined by the parents of Trayvon and Jordan Davis, another unarmed black 17-year-old shot dead by a white man. ""Because you don't need an actual threat. All you've got to do is believe a threat and you can use deadly force.""Wearing a bulletproof vest and living in hotels, George Zimmerman took time out from his armed life on the move to sign autographs over the weekend at an Orlando gun shop.Zimmerman told WOFL-TV that even inside a ""secure"" gun store among 200 supporters, he was still concerned about his safety in light of being acquitted in 2013 of murdering Trayvon Martin.""I always stay cognizant of the fact that there are threats,"" he said Saturday at the Arms Room.

Updated: February 12, 2018 @ 3:35 pmORLANDO, Fla, (WTXL) -- George Zimmerman is back at the center of another controversy after signing autographs at a Central Florida Gun Show.Zimmerman appeared at a scaled-down version of the ""New Orlando Gun Show"" Saturday.    Organizers had to change the location last minute after the original venue backed out of the event. They said they didn't want the negative attention that Zimmerman's appearance would draw.

2	Watch VideosA last-minute venue change didn’t stop George Zimmerman from greeting supporters over the weekend at a Florida gun show.The 30-year-old shook hands and signed his autograph on photos of himself posing with his dog at the New Orlando Gun Show.Organizers of the event invited “George Z” as a featured guest, a move that sparked outrage among area residents.“We all know that our decision to support Mr. Zimmerman has generated some controversy and we expected that,” the Arms Room said Monday in a statement posted to its Facebook page.The original venue space for the event pulled out of participating Thursday after learning about Zimmerman’s appearance, according to NBC’s Orlando affiliate WESH TV.“They told us they canceled for community pressure,” said show organizer Mike Piwowarski. He said the venue received phone calls and backlash from residents who said they did not want Zimmerman there.Piwowarski, who supported Zimmerman throughout his trial, told the NBC station he plans to sue the venue for an estimated $300,000 in lost gun sales because he had to use a smaller space.Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder in July in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. A civil rights investigation is being pursued by the U.S. Department of Justice.Meanwhile Zimmerman has been keeping busy trying to sell own paintings. He was also scheduled to appear in a “celebrity” boxing match for charity, but the event was cancelled over Zimmerman’s  controversial participation.	Entertainment
3	"03.10.2014LifeShare this PostA simple Google search of Zimmerman and it seems like no action of his ever goes unreported. Recent headlines include an announced but later cancelled boxing match with rapper DMX to assaulting his pregnant girlfriend.In case you’ve forgotten, George Zimmerman is the 31-year-old American originally known for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin on February 26th, 2012 in Sanford, Florida. Once on trial, the prosecution argued that Zimmerman should be tried for second degree murder and manslaughter; the jury later acquitted him of all charges.Georgie boy spent his Saturday at the New Orlando Gun Show taking pictures and signing autographs with customers and fans. New York Daily News reported that over the course of six hours, 20 people lined up to see Zimmerman in the rear office of The Arms Room gun store.Originally, the gun show was supposed to be held at the Majestic on John Young Parkway, but organizers had to cancel the venue late Thursday after negative reactions to Zimmerman’s planned appearance, WESH reported.“They told us they canceled for community pressure,” said organizer and dealer Mike Piwowarski.“They were getting phone calls and backlash, and didn’t want that kind of person there.”Angry at Majestic for cancelling the event, Piwowarski plans to sue for an estimated $300,000 in lost gun sales.Piwowarski supported Zimmerman during and after the trial in the shooting death of Martin. Returning the favor, Zimmerman showed up and supported Piwowarski’s gun business.Fox 35 asked Zimmerman if he thought that his appearance at the gun show could be viewed as antagonistic.“I don’t worry about people that say it’s antagonistic,” he said. “To be honest with you, like I said, the importance was to support the people that supported me.”“I’m willing to talk to everyone and try and answer their concerns or questions, and [have] them realize there’s no need to be angry.”Zimmerman said that due to death threats, he still wears a bulletproof vest and that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and is given mental health treatment.Image via YouTubeTags:Florida, george zimmerman, guns, gunshow, New Orlando Gun Show, stand your ground, Trayvon Martin

4	"By Jason Easley on Mon, Mar 10th, 2014 at 7:53 pmGeorge Zimmerman is still trying and failing to cash in on shooting Trayvon Martin. His latest attempt was an autograph session at a Florida gun show that less than 20 people attended.Video of Zimmerman signing autographs:According to The New York Daily News:Only a few handfuls of people showed up Saturday to meet a Florida gun show’s special guest of dishonor — George Zimmerman.Over the course of six hours, fewer than 20 people at the New Orlando Gun Show asked for a free autograph or photo with Trayvon Martin’s reclusive killer, who was hanging out in a rear office of The Arms Room gun store in Orlando.A sign directs people to the Zimmerman meet-and-greet, where fewer than 20 people asked for an autograph or photo over the course of six hours.One couple who met the former neighborhood watchman and wanna-be cop, who gave their names as Melissa and Matt, said they were the only people waiting in line to meet him.….“He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” said Melissa.“It was pretty weird to meet him in person — and wow, he has gained a lot of weight!”Zimmerman has been doing everything that he can think of to build on the infamy that he gained from killing Trayvon Martin. Public outrage forced the cancelation of the celebrity boxing match that Zimmerman was scheduled to participate in. Almost no one showed up at his autograph signing. The message being sent is clear. Society is not going to let George Zimmerman build a career out of being famous for killing an unarmed teenager.Most people if they were involved in an incident where they took the life of another human being would have the decency to express remorse. Most people would keep a low profile. Only the most sociopathic of individuals would look to take advantage of their notoriety. George Zimmerman is a killer without a conscience. He isn’t content with beating a murder charge.Zimmerman expects to be treated like a hero. He is desperately trying to cash in on the innocent life that he took. The good news is that America isn’t going to give George Zimmerman the wealth and fame that he so desperately craves. George Zimmerman wants to be praised and worshipped so badly that he was supposed to be a paying vendor at the gun show. He was going to give away autographs because according to the show’s organizer, he wanted to do an event with less negativity around him.What a fitting blow to this killer’s ego that so few people want his autograph. Zimmerman is not a hero, or a victim, he is a cold blooded killer who deserves every failure that comes his way.Follow Jason Easley on TwitterGeorge Zimmerman Fails To Cash In On Murder as Few Show Up To Meet Him at Gun Show added by Jason Easley on Mon, Mar 10th, 2014View all posts by Jason Easley →

7	"This past Saturday, The Arms Room, a gun store in Orlando, Florida, hosted the New Orlando Gun Show with a very special guest — none other than killer of dangerous Skittle toting youths, George Zimmerman. For the duration of the show, Zimmerman — wearing a bulletproof vest — was located in a back office signing autographs and thanking people for supporting him and his right to shoot unarmed black teenagers. According to The New York Daily News, only 20 people sought his autograph during the 6-hour period he was there. (Fox 35 reported that it was closer to 200 people.) Among the small group were couple Melissa and Matt (they did not give a last name) who received a signed photo of Zimmerman, which they will likely display proudly on some wall in their piece of shit, racist home.""He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there,"" Melissa told the NYDN. ""He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him...It was pretty weird to meet him in person — and wow, he has gained a lot of weight!""In an interview with Fox 35's Valerie Boey, Zimmerman said he is always worried about his safety when in public, but couldn't miss the opportunity to mingle with his supporters face-to-face:Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""You have said you still walk around armed, why is that?""George Zimmerman: ""I walk around armed; I walk around with a bullet proof vest; it's not so much for my safety as it is so much for those around me. I can be around my family and something might happen to them. There's children around me, etc. Those threats… I have to be able to defend myself like any American.Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""Do you think it's appropriate to be here, some may say it's antagonistic?""George Zimmerman: ""I don't worry about people that say it's antagonistic. To be honest with you, like I said, the importance was support the people that supported me.""AdvertisementThe event was moved to The Arms Room at the last minute when the original venue cancelled after receiving too much negative feedback about Zimmerman's appearance. Not to be deterred, the New Orlando Gun Show quickly found a new location and is now suing the original location $300, ooo. (Way to stand your ground, dirtbags.)Image via Getty."	Entertainment

9	ORLANDO, Fla. – George Zimmerman was shaking hands, smiling and signing autographs at a central Florida gun show Saturday.Zimmerman greeted people and autographed photos of him posing with his dog. He appeared at a scaled-down version of the New Orlando Gun Show at the Arms Room store on East Colonial Drive.The show was originally set to be held at the Majestic on John Young Parkway, but organizers said the venue canceled late Thursday after getting negative feedback about Zimmerman’s planned appearance.“They told us they canceled for community pressure,” said Mike Piwowarski, a show organizer. “They were getting phone calls and backlash, and didn’t want that kind of person there.”Piwowarski said he was angry the Majestic canceled the event and he plans to sue for an estimated $300,000 in lost gun sales.Click here to read the rest of this story on WESH. Editor’s NoteTheGrio.com reached out to Majestic Event Center for comment. A rep for the facility declined to comment on anything related to George Zimmerman.	Entertainment
10	Following a last minute cancellation, a local gun store moved the New Orlando Gun Show, featuring George Zimmerman, to their own location (Photo credit: Facebook)A Florida gun dealer was forced to switch the site of a scheduled gun show in Orlando after the venue manager learned that George Zimmerman would be attending.The Arms Room in Orlando last weekend relocated the New Orlando Gun Show from its planned site at the Majestic Event Center, to its own showroom after the venue canceled the booking over Zimmerman’s planned attendance at the show.“We were their first trade show, but when it came out that George was going to be making an appearance, they canceled,” Mike Piwowarski, owner of the Arms Room and the show’s organizer told Guns.com.Zimmerman was to be a paying vendor at the show and was giving out free autographs and posing for photographs in a ‘meet and greet’ type of environment.The controversial figure’s intent, according to Piwowarski, was to be able to attend an event where he would be freer to be himself, where there would be less negativity than he has encountered in other settings.This comes on the heels of Zimmerman’s recent visit to local gunmaker Kel-Tec, getting arrested for domestic abuse, his forays into therapeutic art and failing to organize a celebrity boxing match.The Majestic pulled the plug on the gun show’s location after it learned of Zimmerman’s planned appearance.Majestic’s General Manager, Vikash Mahadeowrite, told the MailOnline that, “It was very detrimental to Majestic’s image as a local business for Arms Room to post on Twitter saying that George Zimmerman would be a guest of honor without confirming that with Majestic and without getting prior approval from Majestic management.”Piwowarski took exception to the statement from Mahadeowrite, noting that the store doesn’t even have a twitter account.At the event, Zimmerman gave out free autographed pictures of him and his canine companion to supporters. (Photo credit: Facebook)After the cancellation from the Majestic, the event scaled down and hurriedly moved to the Arms Room’s retail location on East Colonial Drive.“I’m a huge gun guy, huge Second Amendment guy,” Piwowarski said, “And this really didn’t start off that way. It’s about somebody telling George he couldn’t be there. We’re not going to be told we can’t have him or have someone tell us he can’t be here.”At the smaller show this weekend Zimmerman conducted his meet and greet where he handed out autographed pictures of him and his dog relaxing on a beachfront. Except for taking a break to go for a ride in the store’s 5-ton truck, he stayed on site with his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe.Piwowarski told Guns.com that over 200 came for the event Saturday and another 100 on Sunday. Contrary to threats made of protests and even of the Black Panthers appearing at the event, “We had zero troublemakers show up.”“He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” recounted one event attendee that met Zimmerman.Piwowarski, citing the last minute change in venue caused by the Majestic, plans to sue the center for $300,000 in lost gun sales.“It was a good event,” Piwowarski told Guns.com in reference to the Majestic, “just not a good event center.”Get guns.com news directly in your inbox!

11	"TMP:We are officially living in a world where George Zimmerman is treated like a famous person.The man who will forever be known for killing an unarmed black teenager basked in the limelight Saturday at — where else? — a gun show in central Florida.According to television station WESH, Zimmerman ""greeted people and autographed photos of him posing with his dog.""Organizers of the event were forced change locations after the original venue was hit with a public backlash over Zimmerman's planned appearance.An unabashed gun lover, Zimmerman went on a tour last year of the Florida firearms factory that makes the gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin — a move his own attorney said was a bad idea.This is not a bad thing; this is exactly the kind of spotlight we want on the nutty world of gun shows. Imagine if the spotlight were of someone like Harrison Ford (a name pulled out of a generic celebrity hat), then the gun show would look like it's really happening, look proudly American, look exactly like it's not: sane. But Zimmerman is not your average celebrity. The stupidity of this event's organizers is found in their complete failure to see that the only attention Zimmerman could bring to a gun show is necessarily unwanted.Sign up for the latest news and to win free tickets to eventsBuy tickets to events around PortlandGreat deals on local businessesPrint Archives

And people actually want a signed photo of this guy?Why? WHY?! A million times, WHY?!According to George, this was his way of returning a favor to an Orlando gun store that supported him during his murder trial.  He explained: ""The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn’t pass up.”What a piece of work.While we wish this guy would just GO AWAY already, he continues to stay in the headlines.

lol you forget the FACTS
George Zimmerman is the most provocative piece of shit I have ever met. He should be careful about inviting the devil into his own home (for the second time now)…
lol, ""he stays in the headlines"" CUS U PUT HIM THERE ! IDIOT
Perez, I love your site! Just a friendly suggestion–if we do not want George Zimmerman to remain the spotlight perhaps we should stop reporting stories on him… I am sure he LOVES reading these articles about him.
The only reason he stays in the headlines is because people like you put him there. Quit reporting on him already! If he's such a piece of shit, don't give him attention. Duh.
Stop reporting on him and keeping him in the headlines.  Report on something better for crying out loud.  You're a gossip website, I don't give two flying Fs what this guy is doing.
I believe 100% that George thought Trayvon was going to kill him and that's why he shot him.  I also believe George is not exactly all there.
hahahahahahhahahahahahhahhaahhahahahhaahhahaPerez's pink skid marked panties are in a bunch….hahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahh
Re: TG –  The overrall attention didn't come from us but rather the justice system that let him walk free. Twenty years down the road people will still be talking about this…. DUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!
This guy is a hero, that's why people love him. The liberal, PC bull crap Obumma machine you are a part of is taking the country down. People are tired of it. America needs to wake the F up. Stick to smut, pal.
Only in America….
Re: tempe –  LMAO!
Re: bill –  a latino taking down a negro, lol, could have just been the other way around…. (in a desperate attempt to be as logic as you are)
A simple self-defense case.  At least the mother got a job for life through the state & federaly funded foundation in her sons' name.
Re: Dr. Remulak –  Not really, self-defense stays home, not on the streets unless you are playing cops. No mother can ever cope with the loss of a child, especially this young and the whole brutality of the act. But for some this is just normalcy
Shame on anyone who attended and celebrated this piece of crap and shame on you for promoting this crap on your site.  You're just as wrong.
I get that he was found guilty and all, but what I cannot comprehend is: WHY IS HE A CELEBRITY? Self defense or not there is no reason he should be signing autographs and being in a celebrity boxing match. How is killing someone fame worthy!?
*Correction: not guilty
Re: bill –
Riiiiigggghhhttt. Because the state that Bush left the country in was so much better? It's all Obama's fault and those troublesome democrats. How many murders and school shootings will it take to make a change? I feel sorry for you if this man is what you call a ""hero"".
Re: annainparis –  Nah, if your getting beaten up no matter what the reason and you sincerely think you are going to die then you have the right to defend yourself.  Everything else in the case was just to make money.  Books, speaking engagements, more clients, and that sweet lifetime taxpayer funded ""non-profit"" that will employ his mother for the rest of her life — and provide her with a sweet pension and health benefits.
I think he and casey Anthony should hook up..perfect couple!!!!!!!!
Re: God –  Yes - it's good when you can murder the only witness to your crime and then make up your own story.  And then you con other idjits to call them 'FACTS"" lol.  I laugh, but it's really very sad.  And ignorant.

But, alas, the show was forced to move to a store that sells guns. It's a conspiracy! Still, Piwowarski knew exactly why the Majestic canceled the show.""They told us they canceled for community pressure,"" he said. ""They were getting phone calls and backlash and didn't want that kind of person there.""The main reason Piwowarski invited Zimmerman to his show -- apart from hoping it would kick up gun sales -- was because he was an avid supporter of George's during his time of need.Piwowarski says he supported Zimmerman during his trial for shooting and killing Trayvon Martin. In return for his support, Zimmerman accepted the invitation to appear at the gun show.""The Arms Room family has gone through a tremendous amount of work to secure the location,"" Zimmerman told Orlando's Fox 35. ""Of course, I always stay cognizant of the fact that there are threats. The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn't pass up.""As for the gun show, about 200 people showed up on Saturday, which is below the number of people you would expect to show up to a gun show. Especially in Florida.Of those 200, only 20 actually asked for his autograph.Recognise him? George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Trayvon Martin, was SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS at a Florida gun show: pic.twitter.com/FqSs36dc9O— Jeremy Vine (@theJeremyVine) March 10, 2014 So, to recap: The guy who is famous only because he shot and killed an unarmed black teen and got away with it managed to draw only 20 people to ask for his autograph. At a gun show. In Florida.What a gorgeous day to meet my friends!

14	We have long known that George Zimmerman is a craven attention-seeker. From traffic stops to domestic violence calls, the killer of Trayvon Martin has been in the news with irritating regularity since he was acquitted of second-degree murder in July 2013. But what Zimmerman did over the weekend was, well, just beyond.“Zimmerman greeted people and autographed photos of him posing with his dog,” reported Orlando television station WESH over the weekend. “He appeared at a scaled-down version of the New Orlando Gun Show at the Arms Room store on East Colonial Drive.” Scaled down because the original venue earlier in the week pulled the plug on the event after “negative feedback” over the Zimmerman grip-and-grin. That he is in demand and actually shows up at something like this is an outrage.Last month, Zimmerman granted interviews to CNN, Univision and Fusion Univision to bemoan his life of bulletproof vests and fear that someone will harm him or his family. Throw in his lament about unemployment and homelessness and the pity-party orchestra’s violin section is in full crescendo. Remember, this is the same guy who was reportedly about to get in the boxing ring for a “celebrity” boxing match with the rapper DMX. The gun-show event wasn’t the first time Zimmerman smiled and posed for a  photo. Last August, he did that while he toured the Florida factory of the manufacturer of the gun he used to shoot and kill Trayvon with a single bullet to the chest at close range.This leads to what should be an inevitable question: Who are these people glorifying the killer of an unarmed teenager in one of the most racially polarized incidents in recent history? Why are these autograph hounds going out of their way to shake Zimmerman’s hand? What they could possibly say to him in those few moments is enough to make me fear for humanity’s soul. For if they say to Zimmerman what his most ardent supporters have said to me over the last two years it will offend your sense of decency. At least it should.Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @CapehartjWe are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

16	"This public appearance is so cringe-worthy I can hardly stand to even write about it. George Zimmerman signed autographs at the New Orlando Gun Show. He was the featured guest of The Arms Room, a gun shop that supported him through his trial. Apparently this is his way of giving back. ""The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn't pass up,"" Zimmerman told Fox 35.So how did the giving-back public appearance go? Not quite as well as the planners probably hoped. It kind of makes you wonder, with friends like Zimmerman, does the gun industry really need any enemies?Apparently the backlash almost forced organizers to cancel Zimmerman's appearance. Instead, they moved it to a smaller venue. And when that happens, you know your honored guest is actually more of a liability. I mean, however you feel about the Trayvon Martin case, I can't imagine very many people consider Zimmerman much of a hero.The event was supposed to raise funds for a local dog shelter, Zimmerman says. (Wha--??) About 200 people showed up. I guess that means there are 200 people in Florida and its environs who like Zimmerman enough to show up for his autograph. I'm a little worried about those 200 people. I hope they have other, more worthy heroes.Zimmerman also says he's still carrying a gun and wearing a bullet-proof vest for safety. But not for his own personal safety! He's thinking about the people around him.I walk around armed; I walk around with a bullet proof vest; it's not so much for my safety as it is so much for those around me. I can be around my family and something might happen to them. There's children around me, etc. Those threats… I have to be able to defend myself like any American.Right, if there's one thing that will protect the children who stand near Zimmerman, it's a bullet-proof vest around Zimmerman's body. There are so many children around Zimmerman, living in fear for their lives. Thank goodness Zimmerman is protecting them. With his bullet-proof vest.Did I mention he still doesn't understand why people are still so mad at him? ""No I don't, but I'm willing to talk to everyone and try and answer their concerns or questions, and [have] them realize there's no need to be angry."" Okay, sure George. We should sit down for some coffee and crazy pills and talk about why there's ABSOLUTELY no reason for anyone to be angry with you. Sure.There's another part in the interview where Zimmerman talks about the portrait of State Attorney Angela Corey. And you know what? I give up. There is too much George Zimmerman in George Zimmerman.Honestly, we could spend all day talking about the loony/dumb things Zimmerman says. The point is, I have no idea why anyone in the gun industry would want him anywhere near their event. He doesn't make gun ownership look good -- at all. When is he going away, finally?FOX 35 News OrlandoDo you think George Zimmerman is a good spokesman for anything, or should he just stay under the radar? Image via Fox 35

17	Copyright © 2018 BHM Digital.All Rights ReservedPowered by WordPress.com VIPPosted March 10, 2014George Zimmerman continues to find his way into the national conversation with yet another questionable and ill-advised move. This time, the beleaguered former volunteer night watchman appeared in a Florida gun show over the weekend as its special guest of honor.Zimmerman, who complained of wanting normalcy after being acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin, didn’t heed his words after appearing at the New Orlando Gun Show at the Arms Room store last Saturday. Zimmerman’s appearance at the gun show was supposed to be a much larger affair but was moved to the smaller Arms Room venue after protests ensued.WESH-TV has more:Zimmerman greeted people and autographed photos of him posing with his dog. He appeared at a scaled-down version of the New Orlando Gun Show at the Arms Room store on East Colonial Drive.The show was originally set to be held at the Majestic on John Young Parkway, but organizers said the venue canceled late Thursday after getting negative feedback about Zimmerman’s planned appearance.“They told us they canceled for community pressure,” said Mike Piwowarski, a show organizer. “They were getting phone calls and backlash, and didn’t want that kind of person there.”Piwowarski added that he intends to sue the Majestic venue after losing $300,000 in gun sales due to his estimates. The New York Daily News also covered the story, speaking with a person in attendance at the gun show who described Zimmerman’s mannerisms.“He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” said the attendee.To make the event even more bizarre, Samantha Scheibe, Zimmerman’s girlfriend, also appeared at the event with him. As some will recall, Zimmerman allegedly pointed a firearm at Scheibe during an argument last year.The struggle for Zimmerman charges on.[Gawker]—Photo: WESH-TVCopyright © 2018 BHM Digital.

ORANGE COUNTY, Fla.  –  George Zimmerman made an appearance at a gun store Saturday.He spent the day at The Arms Store, where around 200 customers stopped by to meet him and take pictures.  Fox 35 met up with him to talk about why he was at the store and what life has been like after his acquittal.Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""You've always been concerned about your safety. Are you concerned about your safety today?""George Zimmerman: ""Of course. Certainly.""Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""Then why take a chance?""George Zimmerman: ""Again, it's to support them. The Arms Room family has gone through a tremendous amount of work to secure the location. Of course I always stay cognizant of the fact that there are threats. The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn't pass up.""Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""You have said you still walk around armed, why is that?""George Zimmerman: ""I walk around armed; I walk around with a bullet proof vest; it's not so much for my safety as it is so much for those around me. I can be around my family and something might happen to them. There's children around me, etc. Those threats… I have to be able to defend myself like any American.Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""Do you think it's appropriate to be here, some may say it's antagonistic?""George Zimmerman: ""I don't worry about people that say it's antagonistic. To be honest with you, like I said, the importance was support the people that supported me.""This is the first time George Zimmerman has made an announced public appearance since the trial. A charity boxing match he was going to participate in got canceled after getting public backlash.Zimmerman says he did it for charity, giving back to an animal shelter.""It was a small venue, and it was giving me the opportunity to provide them with much-needed funds,"" he said.""It blew up into something much bigger than that as we all know. I withdrew, however, the promoter continued promoting. That's what they do. Unfortunately, it turned into something that it was never intended to be. It was supposed to be a friendly charity event to raise money for a local dog shelter.""Zimmerman recently sold a painting of the American flag for $100,000. He also recently painted a picture of Angela Corey, State Attorney for the fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida.""I learned through the first few paintings [that] it was a therapeutic release for me,"" Zimmerman said.Fox 35 asked him why the painting was of Angela Corey.Zimmerman said, ""Why not?... It's just an expression, that's all my paintings are. Same way with the flag… Just an expression of my feelings.""Since he was signing autographs and had signed up for a ""celebrity"" boxing match, we asked if he thought of himself as a celebrity.He said, ""No, I still don't, never have. I was asked to [participate in the boxing match]. And if I'm given the opportunity to do good with it, I'd prefer to do good with it then to not.""In regards to whether he understands why people are still angry with him, Zimmerman says he doesn't.""No I don't, but I'm willing to talk to everyone and try and answer their concerns or questions, and [have] them realize there's no need to be angry.""Zimmerman says he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and has received pro bono treatment from more than one mental health professional.He also says he currently does not have a home, but rather moves from hotel-to-hotel. As for why he won't leave Florida, he says this is his home and he won't be chased out. In the near future Zimmerman says he intends to continue his education.Zimmerman wouldn't talk about shooting and killing Trayvon Martin because the Department of Justice investigation continues. He also declined to comment about being in traffic stops by police in Lake Mary and Texas, as well as his two domestic cases, saying his attorney advised him not to comment because of pending litigation.Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""What do you say to those people who are still trying to heal?""George Zimmerman: ""I hope they pray. I hope they have prospective and find solace however it may come to them.""For more Orlando news,go to My Fox Orlando.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino Like us at facebook.com/foxnewslatinoThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

19	Everyone’s favorite tragedy voyeur is back making headlines again. This time, George Zimmerman was signing autographs at a gun show. Zimmerman is best known for killing Trayvon Martin and then being acquitted.On Saturday, accompanied by his dog, Zimmerman posed for photos and gave out autographs. Zimmerman’s appearance was controversial even before the event started. Originally planned to take place at the Majestic, the venue cancelled last Thursday in response to negative feedback it received because of Zimmerman’s appearance.The smaller show was instead held at the Arms Room store.Zimmerman’s appearance at the gun show was repayment for support during his trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin. According to wesh.com, the event’s organizer, Mike Piwowarski, supported Zimmerman during his trial and now, Zimmerman is returning the favor.Zimmerman’s only claim to fame is having benefited from a law that is open to outrageous interpretations and then exploiting his position as a controversial character.

21	"The event, headed up by the man who fatally shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, almost didn't happen due to protestsGeorge Zimmerman, the man who fatally shot black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, was the ‘celebrity guest’ of honour at a gun show in Florida over the weekend. 
The former neighbourhood watchman had a table at the New Orlando Gun Show especially to sign autographs and pose for photographs with 'fans'.However, during the six hour event, fewer than 20 people asked for him to sign the free promotional shots of him with his dog.One couple, who gave their names to the New York Daily News as Melissa and Matt, told the publication that they were the only people waiting to meet him. “He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” said Melissa.“It was pretty weird to meet him in person — and wow, he has gained a lot of weight!” 'X gunna give it to ya:' George Zimmerman has confirmed rapper DMX as his opponent for his highly-anticipated celebrity boxing match, although the date is yet to be confirmed.

Gallagher didn't seem too keen on responding to Williams' offer of: ""would anyone like to see me fight Liam?"" at the Brit Awards in 2000...unless Noel was allowed to take part as wellThe one where it actually happened. Twelve years ago, 'The Office' star Rocky Gervais triumphed in a comical charity boxing match with Grant Bovey, the ex-husband of Anthea Turner.

Perhaps it's not too late?Zimmerman, who hit the headlines after taking part in a string of promotional interviews to mark Martin’s death, said that he was enjoying himself, despite the poor turn-out.“Everything’s good. We’re having fun,” he was quoted as saying. “I’m just here to meet supporters.”He posted the following on Twitter after the event:

And also making out that far more people had turned up than actually had:What a gorgeous day to meet my friends! Thank you all for coming
down to show your support I am so fortunate for each and everyone
of you!Favorite part of weekend, people that apologized 4 buying into
media's reporting at first, then watching the trial & changing
their minds.Zimmerman was joined by his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe, who accused him of threatening her with a gun last year. According to organiser Mike Piwowarski, the meet-and-greet event was initially cancelled, after the original venue hired for the gun show backed out at the last minute when they found out that Zimmerman would be making the controversial appearance. “Come on out and meet George Z! He’s here a few more hours. And no matter what you read, there are no protesters, lunatics or other varieties of a— clowns,” the store posted via its official Facebook page. Piwowarski had invited Zimmerman to attend after meeting him through a mutual friend.Zimmerman, who was controversially acquitted of the second-degree murder and manslaughter of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in July 2013, announced his ambitions to become a lawyer to prevent ‘miscarriages of justice’ from occurring in the future last month.“I'd like to professionally ... Continue my education and hopefully become an attorney,” he told CNN show New Day.“I think that's the best way to stop the miscarriage of justice that happened to me from happening to somebody else. I don't think it should ever happen to anyone ever again, not one person.”However, in the same interview, he also admitted he was worried he'd missed Martin when he shot and fatally wounded him that evening.“I was afraid it had gone through his clothes and that it was going to go ... Get lost, and, um, you know, go into a house and… Because the young man was still talking to me, as I have said.“So I thought that it hadn't… Affected him, and I got worried, and I said, 'I hope that it hasn't—that the bullet hasn't hit a neighbour.'”Last month, a celebrity boxing match featuring George Zimmerman and rapper DMX was cancelled.Taking to Twitter, promoter Damon Feldman posted that he was “done with Zimmerman”, and that he had made the decision to pull the match  because he was “the wrong person to put in a the ring and define celebrity boxing”. A second promoter is since thought to be working on a new boxing event for Zimmerman.Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges, after he fatally shot unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during a fight in February 2012 inside a gated community in Sanford. He claimed that he had killed Martin with a weapon in an act of self-defence.Zimmerman remained without charge for 44 days after the shooting occurred, which led to nationwide protests and sparked furious debate over racial profiling and the right to use weapons in self-defence. Further demonstrations broke out after Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013.Federal authorities are currently reviewing the entire case to decide whether Martin’s civil rights were violated.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

22	"FOLLOW:Terrible painter and noted domestic abuser George Zimmerman, who first rose to prominence as the killer of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, was the guest of honor at a Florida gun show over the weekend. Orlando’s NBC affiliate reports that the event’s original venue backed out after being subjected to what organizer Mike Piwowarski called “community pressure” over Zimmerman’s appearance. Luckily for less decent members of Orlando’s community, a gun store called the Arms Room volunteered to host instead.There, Zimmerman signed autographs and posed for pictures with a crowd of about 200 people, according to Fox 35. When asked to respond to those who might find his presence “antagonistic,” Zimmerman said, “I don’t worry about people that say it’s antagonistic … the importance was to support the people that supported me.” But, when asked if the meet-and-greet, along with his willingness to participate in an eventually canceled celebrity boxing match, indicated that he considered himself a celebrity, Zimmerman demurred, “No, I still don’t, never have.” After all, it’s important to stay humble.Somehow, tax cuts plus more defense spending led to more red ink. It’s so weird.There are still unanswered questions about her resignation.Trump just signed a congressional budget deal on Friday.

25	"ORLANDO, Fla., March 10 (UPI) --  Some attendees at a Florida gun show took the time to get an autograph from George Zimmerman -- just not very many.The organizers of the New Orlando Gun Show had to move their event after announcing that Zimmerman would be the guest of honor, but he still showed up to shake hands and help boost gun sales.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
The show was held at the Arms Room store in Orlando instead of at the Majestic. “They told us they canceled for community pressure,” show organizer told Mike Piwowarski told WESH. “They were getting phone calls and backlash, and didn’t want that kind of person there.”The New York Daily News reported that fewer than 20 people got an autograph from Zimmerman during the six hours that he was at the show. “He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” said a woman who only wanted to be identified as Melissa. “It was pretty weird to meet him in person -- and wow, he has gained a lot of weight!”Samantha Scheibe joined Zimmerman, 30, at the event.“Come on out and meet George Z! He's here a few more hours. And no matter what you read, there are no protestors, lunatics or other varieties of ass clowns,” the store wrote on Facebook. “And don't forget we have free burgers and dogs!”

President Trump's newly proposed budget includes a proposal to end federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, part of a package that includes $300 billion in new spending overall.

The Indianapolis Colts have hired former Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Frank Reich to be their head coach.

We have to remove profit from the health care equation, just like Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase intend to do.

Barack and Michelle Obama will re-emerge on the public stage Monday in Washington, only this time for an event that has nothing to do with politics. 

The White House released a proposed budget that is largely irrelevant, given Congress passed a spending bill last week that outlines priorities.

EASTON, PADreading the looks on their faces once they realized the recipe was truly easy as fuck, local grandmother Rosemary Guzzo, 79, confirmed Monday that she didnt have the heart to tell her family that any dipshit can make lasagna. No, I dont think I can bring myself to do it. Theyd be too crushed to find out I learned how to make Nanas famous lasagna from the back of a Barilla box, said Guzzo, explaining that the dish involved not some old-world secret guarded by generations of Italian matriarchs, but the layering of pasta, meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. You know whats hard to make? Souffl. Not lasagna. Any knuckle-dragging dumbass off the street can set an oven to 375 and pop in a baking pan. At press time, Guzzos daughter had asked her to write down each step so they could enjoy the family treasure for years to come.

Journalist Carl Bernstein on Sunday expressed doubts that President Trump would sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller, citing the presidents compulsive, continual lying.

28	"George Zimmerman, who killed an unarmed black teenager, was the guest of honor at a Florida gun show this weekend, continuing his campaign to become the ultimate troll.This article is from the archive of our partner .George Zimmerman, who killed an unarmed black teenager, was the guest of honor at a Florida gun show this weekend, continuing his campaign to become the ultimate troll.The show almost didn't happen, as its original venue cancelled when it found out that George Zimmerman would be there. A gun store called the Arms Room bravely stepped in to host it instead. The show organizers plan to sue the original venue for $300,000, or three George Zimmerman paintings.Zimmerman signed autographs for the kinds of people who think a man who is famous for nothing more than killing an unarmed 17-year-old should be celebrated. It seems there weren't too many of them: the New York Daily News reported ""fewer than 20 people"" waited in line to talk to Zimmerman over the course of six hours. Fox 35 reported that there were about 200.One of them, ""Melissa"" (who refused to give her last names for some reason), said Zimmerman ""seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him.""""And wow, he has gained a lot of weight!"" she added.Zimmerman's girlfriend, who once accused him of pointing a gun at her before dropping the charges, was also there.Zimmerman told Fox 35 that he doesn't understand why people are still so angry at him, ""but I'm willing to talk to everyone and try and answer their concerns or questions, and help them realize that there's no need to be angry."" He did not propose bringing Trayvon Martin back to life, which is probably the only way to make people not angry.He added that ""of course"" he was worried for his safety by appearing in public, but he ""couldn't pass up"" the opportunity to help the show's organizers and meet his supporters. Also, he is armed and wears a bulletproof vest at all times because ""I have to be able to defend myself like any American."" So that's great.Great day with great people. God bless you America! pic.twitter.com/Xrs3fDPSpGZimmerman would not answer questions about any of his legal issues. This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.
    From the Mayan ballgame Pitz to ancient Greece’s bull-leaping, here’s a tour of the history of athletic games.
The fumbling of domestic-violence accusations against Rob Porter is a story about the administration’s inability to tell the truth, not its disorganization.The White House’s response to allegations of domestic violence against former Staff Secretary Rob Porter has so stunned reporters that the whole episode has become an exemplar of the total disorganization of the Trump administration.“Abuse Case Exposes Fissures in a White House in Turmoil,” The New York Times intones. Axios’s Jonathan Swan writes, “This is crazy. Even in a White House that’s famous for chaos, I’ve never seen anything like this.” Politico’s Playbook simply announced, “CHAOS at 1600 Pennsylvania.”This is peculiar, not only because it is difficult to imagine what would rise to the level of notable chaos relative to the standards of this White House. It’s strange because the focus on disorder has overshadowed the more salient feature of the moment: Insofar as the administration is engulfed in chaos, it is a result of its inability to tell the truth. The Trump team doesn’t have a chaos problem so much as it has a dishonesty problem. Of course this is not new, either—in fact, the serial dissembling of the White House has become so banal that it goes almost unremarked in this case—yet it is on particularly dramatic display here.In the mid-1930s, the Federal Writers’ Project interviewed thousands of former slaves, some of whom claimed the president came to their plantations disguised as a beggar or a peddler, telling them they’d soon be free.Shortly before the election of 1860, a man came upon a plantation near Marlin, Texas, some 20 miles southeast of Waco. Though nobody knew who he was, the plantation owner took him in as a guest. The stranger paid close attention to how the enslaved people working on the plantation were treated—how they subsisted on a weekly ration of “four pounds of meat and a peck of meal,” how they were whipped and sometimes sold, resulting in the tearing apart of families. Eventually, the stranger said goodbye and went on his way, but a little while later he wrote a letter to the plantation owner, informing him he would soon have to free his slaves—“that everybody was going to have to, that the North was going to see to it.” The stranger told the owner to go into the room where he’d slept, and see where he’d carved his name into the headrest. And when the slaveholder went and looked, he saw the name: “A. Lincoln.”Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald rose to the occasion with their paintings of the former president and first lady, while—importantly—continuing their radical projects in black portraiture.Jasmine, African blue lilies, and Chicago’s favorite flower, chrysanthemum, flourish in the botanical backdrop of President Barack Obama’s official portrait. The 44th president appears seated in an ornate chair, with leafy vines threatening to climb up his pant leg.In her official portrait, First Lady Michelle Obama appears seated, too, in a flowing dress designed by Milly. Between her gown, with its touches of geometric patterning, and the sky-blue paint that frames her figure, the painting features a lot of hard-edged abstraction.On Monday, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled the Obamas’ official portraits. President Obama’s portrait, by the Los Angeles–born and New York–based artist Kehinde Wiley, will join the museum’s hall of American presidents, where it will permanently disrupt the march of white presidential paintings. The portrait of Michelle Obama, the work of Baltimore’s Amy Sherald, will be on view with recent acquisitions through November 2018.From Donald Trump to recent op-eds, the male perspective remains—stubbornly, perniciously—the default point of view.The tweet, as so often happens, was at once shocking and deeply predictable.Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused—life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?That was President Trump, on Saturday, ostensibly reacting to the fact that, this week, allegations of domestic abuse led to the resignations of two high-level staffers at the White House. He was also, obliquely, weighing in on #MeToo. The president’s 48-word assessment of the reckoning so many Americans are painfully but productively engaged in made for rich (but thoroughly unsurprising) irony: Trump, of course, has been accused of sexual impropriety by 19 women—and has also been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault, and has also boasted, on national television, about advising friends to “be rougher” toward their wives, and has also been elected president of the United States. His tweet is revealing both in spite and because of those facts: “Peoples[sic],” in the plural; allegation, in the singular. The peoples meaning the “men’s”; the allegation—though in its context, the diminishing adjective is redundant—being a “mere” one.The surprise release of The Cloverfield Paradox, along with acquisitions of other schlocky genre movies, suggests the company is leaning in to its “direct-to-video” approach.Just a year ago, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Netflix was a big player. The streaming company was a little more than a year into releasing its own original movies for its subscribers, and it was looking for prestige hits to gain a foothold as a distributor Hollywood could take seriously. It acquired one of the best-reviewed films of the festival, Mudbound, for $12.5 million, and the Grand Jury Prize winner I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, among others. In terms of prestige, Netflix was lagging behind its competitor Amazon, which had nabbed a Best Picture nomination for its major Sundance acquisition of 2016, Manchester by the Sea. Maybe Netflix’s new slate of indie favorites would turn things around.Images of Carnival season 2018, already underway, with celebrations in Brazil, Portugal, Hungary, Bolivia, Haiti, Spain, Italy, and more.Carnival season 2018 is underway across Europe and the Americas. These pre-Lent festivals, often a blend of local pagan and Catholic traditions, usher out winter and welcome in spring. The largest and most famous—the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil—took place over the past few days.  Gathered here are images of Carnivals around the world, including images from Brazil, Portugal, Hungary, Bolivia, Haiti, Spain, Italy, and more. Depending on available photos, there may be a follow-up post later this week with more from Mardi Gras and other celebrations.Republican lawmakers are increasingly showing disdain for decisions made by the judicial branch—and by extension the rule of law.An old legal anecdote—attributed to such legal notables as Mae West and the Earl of Birkenhead—depicts a frustrated judge asking an obstreperous lawyer, “Are you displaying contempt of court?”“No, your honor,” the advocate responds. “I am trying to conceal it.”I sometimes think simple politeness—a willingness to conceal contempt for other parties, judges, and even law itself—is all that differentiates true lawyers from thugs in contrast-collar shirts. But like other areas of public etiquette, this habitual courtesy is showing strain in the era of Donald Trump.Trump likes to denounce and threaten courts that thwart his will. But the political threat to courts did not begin with Trump and will not end when he is gone. It is part of a civic rot that is eating at the vitals of our democracy, and it is getting worse.Digital stardust won’t magically make future cities more affordable or resilient.The term “smart city” is interesting yet not important, because nobody defines it. “Smart” is a snazzy political label used by a modern alliance of leftist urbanites and tech industrialists. To deem yourself “smart” is to make the NIMBYites and market-force people look stupid.Smart-city devotees all over this world will agree that London is particularly smart. Why? London is a huge, ungainly beast whose cartwheeling urban life is in cranky, irrational disarray. London is a god-awful urban mess, but London does have some of the best international smart-city conferences.London also has a large urban-management bureaucracy who emit the proper smart-city buzzwords and have even invented some themselves.  The language of Smart City is always Global Business English, no matter what town you're in.The president’s budget proposal has some troubling news for the space agency’s next big astronomy mission.The Trump administration has released its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 and put dozens of federal programs on the chopping block, including a brand-new NASA space telescope that scientists say would provide the biggest picture of the universe yet, with the same sparkling clarity as the Hubble Space Telescope.The proposal, released Monday, recommends eliminating the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), citing “higher priorities” at NASA and the cost of the new telescope.“Given competing priorities at NASA, and budget constraints, developing another large space telescope immediately after completing the $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope is not a priority for the administration,” the proposal states. “The budget proposes to terminate WFIRST and redirect existing funds to other priorities of the science community, including completed astrophysics missions and research.”Americans would be less alienated from one another and solve problems more easily if they recognized one little-noticed distinction in policy debates.We sometimes think of political issues in binary terms. Is someone pro-life or pro-choice? But most individuals hold views that are more complicated than a binary can capture.An alternative is to describe a given position on a spectrum. On abortion, an outright ban sits at one extreme; at the other is the elimination of all restrictions on the procedure. In between are a staggering array of coherently distinguishable positions.Politicians seeking to win votes express their stances either in terms of a binary or as a spot on a spectrum, depending on where they see the greatest advantage. Though their beliefs don’t change, how they frame them makes a political difference.* * *There’s a different set of frames, though, that are as relevant as binaries and spectrums, though they are less familiar and less discussed: equilibriums and limits.In a StoryCorps animation, Patrick Haggerty remembers the remarkable advice he got from his dairy farmer dad.It’s an incredible story.

         123View  commentsA Florida gun show was cancelled after organizers publicly announced Trayvon Martin killer George Zimmerman would be a guest at the event - but Zimmerman will still make a public appearance.‘The New Orlando Gun Show,’ scheduled for this weekend at Orlando’s Majestic Events Center, was cancelled Thursday despite more than 100 vendors threatening to take the owners to court if the show did not go on.Organizer Mike Piwowarski, who also owns a local gun store, told ClickOrlando that the show was cancelled because of the announced Zimmerman appearance, and Zimmerman posted emails to his Twitter account backing up that claim.The guest of honor: George Zimmerman, pictured with Mike Piwowarski and two other individuals, caused a gun show to be cancelled after he was named the 'featured guest' ‘We've had discussions with The Majestic and they decided to cancel the event because George Zimmerman was making an appearance,’ said Piwowarski.When contacted by MailOnline, Piwowarski clarified that Zimmerman was to be a paying vendor who wanted to attend for a meet and greet - he would not have charged for any autographs.Zimmerman's intent was to be able to attend an event where he would be more free to be himself, where there would be less negativity than he has encountered in other settings, according to Piwowarski.When asked if organizers had considered possible backlash to Zimmerman's attendance, Piwowarski replied 'I’m not sure that we were gauging reaction at all.. it was someone who was legally
able to have a table.'Not allowed: Majestic's owners said in an email posted online by Zimmerman that the gun aficionado is not allowed on their propertyPiwowarski was notified of the event's cancellation via email, but the Majestic's owners are not returning any of his messages.'it was very detrimental to Majestic's image as a local business for Arms Room to post on Twitter saying that George Zimmerman would be a guest of honor without confirming that with Majestic and without getting prior approval from Majestic management,' general manager Vikash Mahadeowrite in an email provided to MailOnline.Piwowarski was also quick to point out that, per the terms of their contract with the Majestic's owners, they were not required to clear any vendors with management ahead of time.He also refuted claims the announcement was posted on Twitter and said the backlash was generated by Majestic management's reaction, not by the Arms Room post on Facebook.
A picture posted to the Facebook page for The Arms Room, Piwowarski’s gun shop, shows Zimmerman recently visiting the store with the caption ‘we had a friend stop by recently.’Comments on the picture ranged from surprise to outrage, and that is what led Majestic’s owners to call off the whole thing, according to the station.‘The event center asked us to do a few things when they found out Mr. Zimmerman was present; pull down posts, pull down announcement that he was going to be there.,’ Piwowarski recalled during a ClickOrlando interview.‘We did all of that when they asked us to do it,’ Piwowarski continued. ‘They rescheduled the event. Then they later went on to cancel it again, after we complied with all of their requests.’The organizers and more than 100 gun vendors had a year-long contract with the Majestic and plan to go to court if the show does not go on as scheduled, Piwowarski told the station. The show will not go on: The gun show's organizers have confirmed the show has been cancelled and have plans to take the Majestic's owners to court The show’s cancellation will cost the vendors a combined $100,000, Piwowarski claims, and organizers plan to move forward with a lawsuit to recoup that money.'The attorneys are down at the courthouse right now,' he said while speaking to MailOnline.‘Mr Zimmerman will not be permitted on Majestic’s property for the gun show,’ manager Vikash Mahadeo wrote in an email posted online by Zimmerman.Zimmerman also tweeted ‘another company bowing to threats of being labeled racist’ in response to the show’s cancellation.Messages left with Majestic’s owner by MailOnline seeking further comment have not yet been returned.The quarterly gun shows will need to find a new home, Piwowarski explained, and Zimmerman is free to attend and will make an appearance Saturday morning at 10.00am at a mini event at the store featuring a few of the other vendors slated to attend the bigger show.'If Mr Z desires to be there, and
he can legally be there…we don’t do any discrimination.’

36	"To enjoy breathecast.christianpost.com, you'll need to enable JavaScript in your web browser. Please click here to learn how.The new trailer for ""Game of Thrones"" Season 4 has been released. The trailer is nicknamed Vengeance and features a series of characters speaking about justice and avenging the deaths of lost loved ones. What are the clues we can gather about the story-lines in Season 4? And who will be going after who?The trailer begins with Arya Stark relaying a list of characters she harbors a death vendetta against. We already know she harbors a grudge against Cercei and Geoffrey Lanister, but she's now added the names of Tywin, Cercei's father, and the ""Red Woman"" otherwise known as Melisandre. How does her new companion, the Hound, relate to her quest to annihilate his former masters?We know all of the Stark family is seeking revenge for the brutal scourge of their bloodline acted out in the last three seasons. So few remain, and it seems unlikely there will be any justice for their family's plight. Sansa speaks to Tyrion about being haunted by her family's death. Jon Snow expresses some desire for justice, although it's not made clear whether it will be against the murderers of Robb Stark or attempted mutineers in the army of Mormont.Daenarys Targeres still wants justice for the great outrage of her family members exile after their father was dethroned. As she is of the original bloodline that sat on the iron throne, she is thirstily building a more and more impressive army to take over Westeros. Appatrently, she also has a jumbo-sized dragon now. But besides all that, there is a clip where a man talks to her about repaying injustice with mercy, intercut with scenes of the siege of a city. What is the specific injustice they are talking about?The Red Viper is a new character in this season and makes appearance here alongside Cercei. He himself talks about vengeance to her. He is also seen fighting in an arena. It appears that he has aligned himself with the Lannisters fully. But what are his motives and what does he hope to achieve? Fans of the book say that it will be hard to know what the reasons behind his actions are and what he will wind up doing next. If you'd like to view the trailer in its entirety, you may do so here (WARNING: Link may contain strong content).The new season of Game of Thrones is scheduled to premiere April 6th on HBO.Copyright © 2018 BREATHEcast.com All rights reserved.Breathecast is a Christian Media Corporation Company"	Entertainment

38	With each new season four trailer, April and Game of Thrones feels further away. Luckily for us, it’s actually the opposite. With less than a month until the season premiere, HBO has released another trailer and this one is full of the character’s darkest fears and regrets. For Ygritte that means letting Jon go, for Cersei it’s not being able to protect those she loves and for Dany it is the confession that being the Mother of Dragons alone is not enough to win her the Iron Throne. Each scene teases a provocative story to come. Tyrion steals the whole trailer with one line though: “We musn’t disappoint father.”Those chills you are feeling are perfectly normal.Game of Thrones season four premieres Sunday, April 6th at 9pm on HBO.

She blames an early exposure to The X-Files and the Must See TV era of NBC for her twin life-long loves of sci-fi and sitcoms.

41	ByonHBO used the True Detective season finale on Sunday night to unleash a third trailer for Game of Thrones Season 4. Dubbed “secrets,” the trailer promises vengeance, action, and some seriously larger dragons. Revenge is on the mind of the Starks after the events of the red wedding in the penultimate episode of Season 3. Cersei knows this and senses everyone is ready to strike at the Lannisters, and Tywin advises his daughter that no one outside the family circle can be trusted.Sansa Stark gives King Joffrey the evil eye and admits that she lays awake at night, thinking about how her mother and brother were done in. What else can be possibly go through? Or perhaps, what can she do to strike back at the Lannisters and get the heck out of King’s Landing.Oberyn Martell drops his own little line about vengeance to Cersei, and if Cersei is wise, she would take the advice of her father and keep Martell at a distance.We also get a new look at Daenerys Targaryen’s three dragons that are noticeably larger than when we last saw them. They’re playing in a field while their proud mother (of dragons) looks on.The premiere date for Game of Thrones Season 4 is April 6 on HBO.‘Permission’ Review: An Indecent Proposal‘The 15:17 To Paris’ Review: A Big But…‘Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle’ 4K, Blu-ray, Digital and DVD Release Dates and Details‘Suburbicon’ Blu-ray Combo Prize Pack GiveawayWeekend Box Office: Hollywood Fumbles on Super Bowl Weekend‘Deep Blue Sea 2’ to Terrorize Blu-ray, DVD and Digital in April; Watch Trailer Now‘Downsizing’ 4K, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Release Date and Details‘Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri’ Coming to 4K, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital This Month‘Permission’ Review: An Indecent Proposal‘The 15:17 To Paris’ Review: A Big But…‘The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter’ Review: Despair Has Never Looked So Good‘Of Mice And Sand – Revised’ Review: The Best Laid Plans’12 Strong’ Review: …And The Horses They Rode In OnCopyright © 2007-2016 TheHDRoom, Zboos LLC	Entertainment
42	Game of Thrones is up next. Yes, now that HBO has wound up its surprise hit and cultural phenomenon True Detective, another HBO hit series and cultural phenomenon steps into the Sunday night spotlight. But before the April 6 premiere of Game of Thrones Season Four, HBO has unleashed another teaser to get fans all worked up.This Game of Thrones Season Four trailer, the third official preview for the new season, hit YouTube Sunday night and had already registered over 900,000 views by Monday.The trailer, titled “Secrets,” packs a startling amount of Game of Thrones action into its 92 second running time.Just a few of the highlights:Cersei Lannister wonders, “What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?” Good question. But it raises another question. Who has the scheming Cersei been unable to protect? Up until now, she’s been someone that other characters needed protection from.Tywin Lannister is sitting on the Iron Throne. What’s that all about? The Lannister patriarch always functioned best as the power behind the throne and never showed any desire to hold the title of king. We knew that the wretched little weasel Joffrey never really held any significant power, beyond the power to chop off a few heads and torture women to get his rocks off. But is he no longer even a figurehead? Do tell, Tywin?Daenerys Targaryen has really big dragons. The Game of Thrones trailer wraps up with a shot of one of her pets — or children as the case may be — rising up and spreading its wings. And those are some wings. The kids sure have grown since the last time we saw them.The Red Viper is here to help. Cersei Lannister is seen in the trailer confiding in this new character, Oberyn Martell. But what is his agenda? From the trailer, it appears that he’s taking the Lannister side, or at least Cersei’s. But things are rarely as they seem in Game of Thrones.Check out the latest Game of Thrones trailer, below.All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.	Entertainment

The newest trailer aired just before the blood-curdling finale of the freshman mystery series True Detective.The new Game of Thrones season 4 trailer focuses on loss, and the consequences that echo with the living. Though the Stark family is certainly at the forefront of this suffering (many thanks to the Boltons and Freys!), it doesn’t look like any major house will escape the dark hand of punishment by the season’s end.As readers of the Song of Ice and Fire series by George RR Martin will know, the new Game of Thrones season 4 trailer focuses on the events of the second half of A Storm of Swords, the third book in the ongoing fantasy saga. Related: Game of Thrones season 4: A spoiler-free guide to the game’s new playersThe official synopsis for the new season, recently released by HBO, promises vibrant new characters, struggles for families who appear triumphant, and unexpected victories for the vanquished. And as always, danger looms in the icy threat of White Walkers to the north – and now grows in the fiery form of dragons in the distant east.The summary for the first episode of Game of Thrones season 4, titled “Two Swords,” avoids the mention of weapons while implying ample treachery.Tyrion welcomes a guest to King’s Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow finds himself unwelcome. Dany is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya runs into an old friend.Still, by Game of Thrones standards, the synopsis sounds almost cheerful.

HBO has unveiled its third trailer for Game of Thrones season four -- and it's full of pithy lines from the show's major players.Among the gems:""Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are, or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."" - Petyr""I will answer injustice with justice."" - Daenerys""I will not become a page in someone else's history book."" - StannisPHOTOS: 'Game of Thrones' Unleashes 15 Season 4 PhotosThere's also some self-doubt from Jon Snow -- who proclaims he's ""done plenty wrong"" -- and signs that things are getting even worse for Sansa (and we thought that wasn't possible). The crown jewel of the piece is a shot of Tywin sitting on the Iron Throne, looking quite regal.Game of Thrones season four debuts Sunday, April 6, at 9 p.m. on HBO.

The Starks is the nation’s favourite Game Of Thrones family with the finale of the first season proving to be the UK’s favourite episode in the story so far.Giving the nation a chance to watch again from the beginning or become fans for the very first time, Sky is offering two ways to enjoy every single episode from the past three seasons.For anyone who hasn’t yet experienced the GAME OF THRONES phenomenon, now there is an easy way from Sky to catch up on every episode of one of the most talked about TV shows in the UK.

Or so says Jon Snow in the 3rd trailer for season 4, titled Secrets. Again, beware of spoilers, if you are not up to speed on season 3 then don’t watch this preview of Game of Thrones.Lots of words of wisdom thrown left and right in 90 seconds or so, also Daenerys, more than ever before, is not to be messed with. If those three dragons that ain’t so little anymore don’t scare you, then her attitude sure will. The merciful Daenerys Targaryen seems long gone by now.Then there are the nightmares of one Sansa Stark, and here I ask what’s worse, being told what happened and letting your imagination run wild or seeing it with your own eyes, like little Arya Stark did?Swords will clash and people will die in the never-ending war for power over Westeros. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series of books (which there are still 2 that have yet to be finished), Game of Thrones was created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. Among many other names the show stars Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner.Season 4 of Game of Thrones stars April 6th, so four weeks from now we’ll be talking about the first episode.

54	"Posted on Monday, March 10th, 2014 by Angie HanEven as HBO viewers the world over try to recover from last night’s True Detective finale, the network would like to remind you that there’s another acclaimed, buzzworthy HBO drama coming back up on the horizon. The new Game of Thrones Season 4 trailer opens on a fairly melancholy tone, as Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) bitterly recounts the horrors that have been visited upon her and her family.Unfortunately for her but fortunately for us, the rest of the promo — along with some newly released plot synopses — suggest that Westeros’ troubles are far from over. Watch the Game of Thrones Season 4 trailer and get some new plot details after the jump.First, here’s the promo, which features some juicy new footage.And here’s the synopsis for the season as a whole (via Winter Is Coming).Encouraged by the Red Wedding slaughter in the Riverlands that wiped out many of their Stark nemeses, the Lannisters’ hold on the Iron Throne remains intact … but can they survive their own egos, as well as new and ongoing threats from the south, north and east? While an unbowed Stannis Baratheon continues to rebuild his army in Dragonstone, a more immediate danger comes from the south, as Oberyn Martell, the Lannister-loathing “Red Viper of Dorne,” arrives at King’s Landing to attend Joffrey’s wedding to Margaery Tyrell, and perhaps act on an ulterior agenda. In the north, a depleted Night’s Watch seems overmatched against the inexorable Wall advances of Mance Rayder’s army of wildlings, which in turn is being trailed by an even more formidable foe: the undead White Walkers. As if that weren’t enough, Daenerys Targaryen, accompanied by her menacing trio of dragons and army of Unsullied, is poised to liberate Meereen, the largest city in Slaver’s Bay, which could ultimately provide her with enough ships to sail to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne.HBO has also released shorter synopses for the first four episodes:Episode #31: “Two Swords”
Debut: SUNDAY, APRIL 6 (9:00-10:00 p.m. ET/PT)
Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) welcomes a guest to King’s Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) finds himself unwelcome. Dany (Emilia Clarke) is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya (Maisie Williams) runs into an old friend.
Written by David Benioff & D. B. Weiss; directed by D. B. Weiss.Episode #32: “The Lion and the Rose”
Debut: SUNDAY, APRIL 13 (9:00-10:00 p.m.)
Tyrion lends Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a hand. Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery (Natalie Dormer) host a breakfast. At Dragonstone, Stannis (Stephen Dillane) loses patience with Davos (Liam Cunningham). Ramsay (Iwan Rheon) finds a purpose for his pet. North of the Wall, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) sees where they must go.
Written by George R.R. Martin; directed by Alex Graves.Episode #33: “Breaker of Chains”
Debut: SUNDAY, APRIL 20 (9:00-10:00 p.m.)
Tyrion ponders his options. Tywin (Charles Dance) extends an olive branch. Sam (John Bradley) realizes Castle Black isn’t safe, and Jon proposes a bold plan. The Hound (Rory McCann) teaches Arya the way things are. Dany chooses her champion.
Written by David Benioff & D. B. Weiss; directed by Alex Graves.Episode #34: “Oathkeeper”
Debut: SUNDAY, APRIL 27 (9:00-10:00 p.m.)
Dany balances justice and mercy. Jaime tasks Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) with his honor. Jon secures volunteers while Bran, Jojen (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Meera (Ellie Kendrick) and Hodor (Kristian Nairn) stumble on shelter.
Written by Bryan Cogman; directed by Michelle MacLaren.Let’s all pause a moment to appreciate HBO’s knack for understatement. “Joffrey and Margaery host a breakfast” sounds like the most boring plotline in the world, but this being Game of Thrones you know there’s going to be crazy amounts of drama (and possibly even some bloodshed) involved.Game of Thrones Season 4 premieres April 6.

Cersei asks.""We can avenge them,"" Martell replies.There is also a great scene of Tywin sitting on the Iron Throne. ""We mustn't disappoint father,"" says Tyrion as he looks on bitterly.Daenerys, mother of dragons, manages to steal most of the spotlight. Her dragons have clearly grown, and so has Dany's drive to take the Iron Throne.""Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy,"" Ser Barristan Selmy advises her.""I will answer injustice with justice,"" Daenerys replies resolutely.As a further tease, HBO has also released summaries for the first four episodes of season 4.Episode 1, ""The Two Swords"":""Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) welcomes a guest to King's Landing.

(HBO)http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/game-of-thrones-season-4-teasers-posters-all-men-must-die/attachment/gameofthrones-season4-poster/21The return of “Game of Thrones” is just weeks away, and a new trailer suggests that the infamous Red Wedding promises to have great impact on the surviving characters as Season 4 unfolds.In the latest promotional clip for HBO’s massively popular and critically acclaimed political fantasy series, based on George R.R. Martin’s bestselling “A Song of Ice and Fire” book series, Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) asks her husband Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), “Do you know what they did to my brother — and my mother? I lie awake all night thinking about how they died.”Death, of course, is all too common in the world of Westeros, but the Red Wedding, the event that helped draw Season 3 to a close with the gruesome murder of several important members of the Stark clan, unquestionably ranks as one of the series’ most shocking moments.Of course, fans familiar with Martin’s saga are well aware that “All Men Must Die” — the phrase serves as the Season 4 tagline.Premiering April 6, the upcoming season follows the events of the second half of Martin’s third book in the series, “A Storm of Swords,” but also introduces occurrences and characters from other novels, including the Dornish Prince Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal). The so-called Red Viper who comes to King’s Landing seeking vengeance is seen talking with Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) in the new clip.As for the familiar characters, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) must prepare to defend the Wall against a Wildling invasion; Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), handless and shaken, struggles to find his place in the kingdom; and cruel King Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) finally is set to wed Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer).Meanwhile, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) continues her conquest of Slaver’s Bay after having freed the slaves of Yunkai, but as her dragons mature and grow and her empire expands, she finds herself grappling with her leadership role.Click through the gallery above for a more detailed look at Season 4, and let us know what you think of the latest trailer in the comments.— Gina McIntyre and Noelene ClarkRECENT AND RELATEDMaisie Williams on what’s best for Arya Stark‘Thrones’ exclusive: George R.R.

57	 Spoilers Game of Thrones 1 Comment March 10, 2014Who is ready to see the arrival of more awesomeness on HBO? Sunday, April 6 is not so far away anymore, and that is when the latest season of “Game of Thrones” shall arrive for your viewing pleasure.So just what will unfold across Westeros and beyond this time around? If you’ve seen some of the trailers that are out there already, then odds are, you already have a pretty good idea. There will be violence, there will be destruction, and above all, there will be reasons to stand up and celebrate so long as you love the stakes being raised to another level.For us, the winner of the “most intriguing moment” from the trailer comes just after the midway point, mostly because that is where you get a quick glimpse of Tywin Lannister sitting on the Iron Throne. What does this really mean? Maybe this is a dream sequence, but we cannot imagine someone with no ties at all to the Baratheon family being particularly embraced by most of the subjects of King’s Landing. At least the general sentiment here is that Tywin is in control, and that much is very much true. Joffrey may have his moments of defiance, but as a whole he is just another puppet to the kingdom.While there are times that we wish there was a little more light and shade in the Danaerys storyline, at least you know from this that her dragons are no longer the small, cute creatures that they once were. Instead, they are getting closer to becoming actual dragons, and that is a tremendous sight to see.Start counting down the days; after all, it’s really only going to be a matter of time before HBO releases another trailer for this season, and gives us yet another reason to start getting excited.You can see the just-released synopsis on the story ahead over at the link here; meanwhile, be sure to also sign up for our CarterMatt Newsletter for more scoop on all things TV!Photo: HBOMy 12 year old neighbor could have written a better article.

58	"TrendingGame of Thrones is always thrilling, but the show’s latest trailer promises a world of hell breaking loose come April 6. Jon Snow (Kit Harington) isn’t exaggerating when he says that the entire world fell apart during his time north of The Wall — and from the looks of things, it won’t be glued back together anytime soon.Westeros — particularly King’s Landing — is a giant pressure cooker right now, and this latest trailer makes it clear that the boiling point is well on its way.






“Do you know what they did to my brother?” the still-captive Sansa (Sophie Turner) asks an understandably guilty-looking Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) at the beginning of the trailer. “I lie awake all night thinking about how they died.”Sansa’s family was ripped to shreds at the end of Season 3 — and her sister Arya (Maisie Williams) is still surveying the wreckage with The Hound (Rory McCann) when things pick up — but at least the Lannisters are having some issues, too. All Tyrell distrust aside, the reigning family will experience a whole new level of threat when newcomer Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal) shows up with a pretty wicked score to settle.And there’s also the permanently treacherous Littlefinger, who shows up in the trailer with this gem:“Always keep your foes confused,” he says. “If they don’t know who you are or what you want, they can’t know what you plan to do next.”Ooh, I wonder what he’s talking about! (Fellow book readers beware — spoiler-y comments WILL be deleted!)Of course, this being Game of Thrones, the show’s de facto star Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) also appears in the trailer — with some seriously ginormous dragons and a giant chip on her shoulder when it comes to her status as a leader.“I will answer injustice with justice,” she growls at her companion Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen), when he dares to suggest some leniency.Saucy!Game of Thrones premieres Sunday, April 6 on HBO. In the meantime, check out the new trailer, freak out accordingly, and leave your thoughts and theories in the comments!— Shaunna MurphyFollow @ShaunnaLMurphy"	Entertainment
59	"With the most excellent season finale for True Detective last night on HBO, the premium cable network placed a pretty spiffy new trailer ahead of it for the next big series to debut on April 6th with Game of Thrones. This season has a lot of anticipation going into it after what we’ve witnessed in the first three seasons, this one more so in some ways as it’s combining material that takes place along the same timeframe from books three and four. There’s new characters populating this season, old ones that take new routes and a number that will fall victim to George R.R. Martin’e devilish pen as the death count will be wondrous to see unfold.The new trailer is a bit restrained in a way, the quiet before the storm, but the storm most certainly will be throughout much of this season.Chris has been writing about anime, manga, movies and comics for well on twenty years now. He began AnimeOnDVD.com back in 1998 and has covered nearly every anime release that’s come out in the US ever since.He likes to write a lot, as you can see.Chris Beveridge – who has written 46393 posts on The Fandom Post.Simulcasts/Series

I lie awake all night thinking about how they died.""The clip then cuts to Cersei walking through the gardens with a new character, Oberyn Martell, where the two may be possibly forming an alliance for the Lannisters.She asks the man, ""What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?""To which he replies, ""We can avenge them.""Daenerys Targaryen is also seen throughout the promo ruling her new and increasingly large army of former slaves however, it looks like there may be a change in her relationship with her dragons.When Ser Jorah tells the Khaleesi, ""You're Daenerys. You're the mother of dragons."" She explains, ""I need to be more than that.""The producers of the show also decided to release the titles of the first four episodes of the new season.

71	 Westeros has somehow fallen even further to shit since the finale of Game of Thrones' third season. The Starks are dwindling in their numbers, Littlefinger is more devious than ever before, Daenerys Targaryen is being questioned by her most loyal of subjects and the Lannisters appear to be destroying themselves from within. At least one thing is consistent: The seasons may be changing, bit Jon Snow — the prettiest, poutiest bastard son to ever come out of Winterfell — is still pretty and pouty. Lighten up, Silky Locks! Spring is coming (as is the April 6 premiere date of Game of Thrones).	Entertainment
72	"“Game of Thrones” might not be returning to HBO with its fourth season until April 6th, but that hasn’t stopped the fantasy series from leaking a teasing promo to get us prepared! Just recently, David Benioff and his team released a dark trailer that surprisingly revealed more information about the upcoming season than we had ever anticipated.The clip began with a scene between Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) and Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) as she opens up about the death of her family members.“You know what they did to my brother and my mother,” she said referring to the bloody Red Wedding where Catelyn and Robb were unexpectedly murdered. Ironically, it’s Tyrion’s family who was behind the massacre. Tywin gave Lord Walder Frey his word that if he was to deceive the Starks after breaking bread (guest right) that he would protect the treacherous royal.“I lie awake all night thinking about how they died,” she continued. Tyrion looked empathetic as he listened to Sansa pour her heart out. But don’t expect Turner’s character to bawl her eyes out during Season 4. According to the “GoT” actress, Sansa will be cracking skulls and taking names in the upcoming season.“There’s a kind of a big evolution [for Sansa in Season 4],” Turner told Wet Paint about the development of her character. “She begins to kind of manipulate the people who have done wrong to her in her past. She becomes a good powerhouse character but in a very subtle way. It’s really good.”""I feel like I've been waiting for a moment where I can manipulate the people that have come before me, so it was like I had been waiting for it for so long. It was a release,” Turner said.But Sansa won’t be the only female character from “Game of Thrones” to be sharpening her sword. According to the promo, Cersei Baratheon (Lena Headey) will also be preparing for vengeance.“What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?” Cersei says. “We can avenge them,” she’s told.Jon Snow (Kit Harington) then makes his way into the trailer on horseback.“All that time I was gone the world’s fallen apart,” he said. He’s right, things have gotten a bit crazy in the world of the Westeros. From undead icemen to territorial dragons, “Game of Thrones” is picking up the pace rapidly when it comes to drama.“Always keep your foes confused. If they don’t know who you are or what you want they can’t know what you plan to do next,” Little Finger advised in the Season 4 promo.One of the most exciting scenes in the promo deals with Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) who will be attempting to take on another slave city—Meereen. In Episode 1, “Two Swords,” the Mother of Dragons will be attempting take overrun Meereen, which would bring her one step closer to reclaiming the Iron Throne.“Sometimes it’s better to answer injustice with mercy,” Daenerys is counseled.“I will answer injustice with justice,” she responds.It looks like the blond haired beauty will be even a bigger force during Season 4 as she tries to become more than the just the mother of dragons.Other scenes from the promo include Ygritte getting reprimanded for letting Snow ride off, Cersei locking lips with Oberyn and Bran attempts to survive north of the wall.Are you excited for Season 4 of “Game of Thrones”?

74	"HBO has released the third trailer for its upcoming fourth season of ""Game of Thrones.""The trailer begins with Sansa Stark talking about the death of mother and brother at the Red Wedding; Cersei Lannister talks about how power doesn't protect the ones she cares for, while Jon Snow struggles with all that has changed since he left Winterfell.""In the wake of the Red Wedding, how does the North pick up the pieces and with their greatest enemy seemingly crushed, where does that leave the Lannisters,"" HBO official synopsis reads.  ""Daenerys Targaryen now has an army but is she ready to take back her homeland. Does Jon Snow turn south to seek revenge or remember his duty along the Wall?""""Game of Thrones"" season for will premiere on April 6.In other ""Game of Thrones"" news, ComicBookMovie.com might have gotten their hands on the first four episode descriptions from season four.  Check out what might happen in the series below.[WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD]1.  Season 4, Episode 1: Two Swords.""In the books, the Lannisters add one final insult to the late Ned Stark when they melt down his sword 'Ice' and forge two new ones for Jamie and Joffrey. It's likely this ep. focuses on the very different man Jamie has become, especially in contrast to his psychotic nephew son.""2.  Season 4, Episode 2: The Lion and the Rose.""The lion is the symbol of house Lannister, the rose house Tyrell - so we can assume this is the episode in which Joffrey and Margery tie the knot. Their nuptials have been dubbed 'he purple wedding' by fans, but you'll have to watch events unfold to find out why! ""3.  Season 4, Episode 3: Breaker of Chains.""'Breaker Of Chains' is yet another moniker for Daenerys Targaryen, so we can assume this ep will be focused on her. What she'll be doing is debatable, as Dany and her pals are some of the characters that most liberties seem to have been taken with in season 4, due to the fact that they're actually not featured that much in the books at this point.""4.  Season 4, Episode 4: Oathkeeper.""Back to those swords again. Joffrey names his 'Widow Maker'...while Jamie names his, you guessed it, 'Oathkeeper'. In the books he actually gives the sword to Brienne and instructs her to keep her word to Caitlen Stark by seeking out and protecting her remaining children."""	Entertainment

79	New trailer gives more than enough to get both the diehard fans of George R.R. Martin’s novels and causal viewers talkingThe last time we had a new trailer for the highly anticipated fourth season of Game of Thrones, it aired on HBO in the US before a then little know series making its debut called True Detective. That has since gone on to be a huge hit as part of Matthew McConaughey’s “McConaissance”, so it seems fitting that a third trailer would air ahead of its season finale.This trailer is titled “Secrets”, and the focus of the teaser does seem to be our favourite characters either discovering or hiding something from those around them.The preview kicks off with the ever despicable Joffrey unveiling his new sword; a sword which is forged [Minor Spoiler Alert] from “Ice”, the weapon once held by Ned Stark. In the George R.R. Martin books that the series is based on, the Lannisters melt it down in order to forge new blades for Joffrey and his uncle/father, Jamie. Talk about adding insult to injury, especially after they used it to behead the heroic leader of House Stark back in season one! The season premiere of Game of Thrones is actually titled “Two Swords”, so it’s likely that this will be a big focus of the episode.Following glimpses of Sansa adjusting to her miserable new life as Tyrion’s wife and Arya with her new guardian The Hound, the trailer teases the arrival of the mysterious Red Viper in King’s Landing, before picking up with Jon Stark. Having returned from beyond the wall, it appears as if he quickly learns about the fate of his half-brother and the mess that Westeros currently finds itself in. Of course, Jon has his own problems to deal with as The Wildlings continue to plan their attack against the men of the Night’s Watch.“Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy,” says Ser Barristan Selmy before Daenerys replies with the rather ominous, “I will answer injustice with justice.” It is then that we get a glimpse of her huge army (consisting of the slaves of Yunkai), as they attack a city she clearly means to take as part of her plan to return to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne. Of course, Daenery isn’t the only one who has her sights set on taking it, and Stannis Baratheon can be seen still plotting how he will rise to power despite his crushing defeat during one of season three’s best episodes.Talking of action, the trailer also emphasises just how much of that we’ll see in the fourth season of Game of Thrones, and after rapid shots of battles taking place all over Westeros, we’re left with the really quite disconcerting image of Tywin Lannister sitting atop the Iron Throne. That spells trouble for Tyrion (who unfortunately doesn’t get an awful lot of the spotlight here, but can seemingly once again be seen imprisoned), although it clearly isn’t worrying Jamie and Cersai as they can be seen wasting no time in reigniting their incestuous relationship.Perhaps the most notable new snippets of footage however are those which focus on Daenerys’ dragons, and it’s clear that they’ve grown considerably since we last saw them. Fans of the books were concerned that a TV budget wouldn’t be able to ever do them justice, but HBO have clearly gone all out to make them look as real as possible, and their presence in the series moving forwards promises to be one of the most intriguing elements of season four.Yet again, this is a trailer which has offered up only 90 seconds of footage, but still more than enough to get both the diehard fans of George R.R. Martin’s novels and causal viewers talking. In what might just be the most shocking and violent season of Game of Thrones yet (yes, even more so than the Red Wedding…just wait until the Purple Wedding!), there really are plenty of “Secrets” left to be uncovered.* Game of Thrones returns to Sky Atlantic on April 7 (just one day after it airs in the US) at 9pm	Entertainment

Game of Thrones‘ third season featured a whole lot of treachery, back-stabbing, and duplicitous action that gave rise to bloody murder, even by the ultra-popular HBO medieval fantasy/intrigue drama’s standards. It’s no wonder then that nearly everyone in Westeros is looking for some kind of vengeance, retribution or similar form of payback as season 4 picks up. (Well, unless you’re King Joffrey, in which case you’re waving around unearned bragging rights about having already won the war for the Iron Throne.)Of course, Tyrion Lannister has shared a few key words of wisdom on that subject: “If you want justice, you’re come to the wrong place,” which is a hard lesson that remains to be learned by the remaining Starks, even as events conspire to reveal the true allegiances among King’s Landing’s residents – meaning that Joffrey could soon get the punishment he deserves, though it won’t necessarily be for reasons that have anything to do with moral righteousness. if( adsNinjaWinnerAds['content - more injection'] ){ document.write( adsNinjaWinnerAds['content - more injection'].content ); } The list of those still playing the game grows shorter every season, though we still count Peter Dinklage (X-Men: Days of Future Past), Lena Headey (Dredd), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Oblivion), Emilia Clarke (Terminator: Genesis), Kit Harington (Pompeii), and Maisie Williams (Gold) among its contestants.No one is truly safe on Game of Thrones this season, as even those who don’t wind up kicking the bucket can suffer in other ways. For evidence of that, see the mounting emotional trauma that’s been inflicted upon Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), or the permanent debilitating physical injuries that Jaime Lannister (Waldau) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) were dealt last season. if( adsNinjaWinnerAds['every images #1'] ){ document.write( adsNinjaWinnerAds['every images #1'].content ); } 
Meanwhile, as the latest trailer and past-unveiled previews for season 4 alike have reminded us, there are far greater developments unfolding in the southern and northern portions of the Game of Thrones universe. Dany’s habit of conquering every kingdom that crosses her path – coupled with her increasingly large (and uncontrollable) dragons – will eventually make the various machinations at King’s Landing seem rather trivial. On the other side of the world, though, there’s not just an army of Wildlings ready to storm The Wall, but also a legion of White Walkers lurking out in the bitter cold.
Question is, by the time that winter does finally arrive (figuratively and literally), will there be so many players left standing? If not, well, at least all those invaders from the North and South will have all that lovely countryside to appreciate by themselves – and then fight each other to death while claiming it for themselves, naturally.
Game of Thrones season 4 begins airing on HBO on April 6th, 2014.

84	HBO had itself a busy Sunday with the 'True Detective' finale (crashing HBO GO while they were at it), but that doesn't mean we were short for a new look at 'Game of Thrones' season 4. There are even more dragons, as everyone's secrets come back to haunt them in the latest look at season 4 of HBO's George R.R. Martin-adapted epic!While the first four episode synopses gave us a good idea of what's to expect when 'Game of Thrones' season 4 premieres on April 6, the latest trailer for the new season sees poor Sansa Stark lying awake in thought of what happened to her mother and brother, also affording speaking roles for Littlefinger and the Red Viper. Dany's dragons have grown too big to be controlled, as she sets her army on the largest slave-operated city Mereen, while Jon Snow wonders how much has changed since his time with the Wildlings.In the meantime, there’s always photos, trailers and teases for the April 6 premiere, while HBO has cast in known roles Joel Fry as Hizdahr zo Loraq, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Mace Tyrell, Pedro Pascal as Prince Oberyn Martell, Indira Varma as Oberyn’s lover Ellaria Sand, Yuri Kolokolnikov as Styr, Magnar of Thenn, and ‘Sherlock’ star Mark Gatiss as Tycho Nestoris. ‘Treme”s Michiel Huisman will replace Ed Skrein as Daario Naharis, and Hafthor Julius Bjornsson will take over the role of Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane from Ian Whyte, among other recastings.So, what do you think?

87	"Emilia ClarkeBeware of spoilers flying around in the final days before Season 4 launches.Prepare to abandon your social life for several months and retreat into the darkness with season 4 of Game of Thrones. The new series starts airing on April 7th, but before that, the good people of HBO have bestowed upon us a new trailer, which launched Sunday night in the US.Meet Pedro Pascal, aka Oberyn Martell.The clip is mostly put together to get fans even more amped up for the upcoming season, rather than to reveal any actual plotlines. Daenerys and her dragons are gaining power, while the power struggle between the Lannisters continues (with Tyrion mostly losing). But most fans knew all that already.For any actual plotlines, the statement that HBO released along with the trailer was much more helpful. Mild spoilers to follow. Major spoilers for those not up to date on season 3. According to the statement, shared by the Guardian, the Lannisters continue their power struggles in the midst of approaching threats from all sides, while Stannis sits safely back at Dragonstone, “rebuilding his army.”Watch the new trailer, courtesy of HBO - unless you're watching out for spoilers.The biggest twist this season will come in the face of Oberyn Martell – book fans have been expecting this for an entire season now. Like everyone else in the series, he has complex political ambitions, but is mostly there to mess with the Lannisters, which is always appreciated.

The new series starts airing on April 7th, but before that, the good people of HBO have bestowed upon us a new trailer, which launched Sunday night in the US.Meet Pedro Pascal, aka Oberyn Martell.The clip is mostly put together to get fans even more amped up for the upcoming season, rather than to reveal any actual plotlines. Daenerys and her dragons are gaining power, while the power struggle between the Lannisters continues (with Tyrion mostly losing). But most fans knew all that already.For any actual plotlines, the statement that HBO released along with the trailer was much more helpful. Mild spoilers to follow. Major spoilers for those not up to date on season 3. According to the statement, shared by the Guardian, the Lannisters continue their power struggles in the midst of approaching threats from all sides, while Stannis sits safely back at Dragonstone, “rebuilding his army.”Watch the new trailer, courtesy of HBO - unless you're watching out for spoilers.The biggest twist this season will come in the face of Oberyn Martell – book fans have been expecting this for an entire season now. Like everyone else in the series, he has complex political ambitions, but is mostly there to mess with the Lannisters, which is always appreciated. Meanwhile Westeros is also threatened from the North – between the wildlings and the White Walkers, this season will have antagonists galore. In short, big things are about to go down. Bring on the season premiere!Bonus: Season 4 Daenerys, looking just about ready to win EVERYTHING.Daenerys Targaryen and Missandei in #GoTSeason4 http://t.co/8SlLt67hCS #GameofThrones @missnemmanuel— Game Of Thrones (@GameOfThrones) January 30, 2014Daenerys Targaryen and Missandei in #GoTSeason4 http://t.co/8SlLt67hCS #GameofThrones @missnemmanuel

89	"130.4m sharesLike a White Walker heading south to The Wall, the new season of Game of Thrones is edging ever closer. To make that wait all the more agonising, HBO have released yet another superb trailer for season 4, packed with swordplay, secrets, deception and, of course, dragons.Here’s the highlights from the latest trailer, as we don our armour (figuratively) in preparation for the return to Westeros…1. Boltons loom largeSansa’s often been a frustrating character, but with her family brutally murdered at the Red Wedding, she’s got just cause to be a bit upset. And as a shot of Roose Bolton and his Theon-tormenting son Ramsay confirms, evil endures in Westeros while honourable families like the Starks are eliminated. 2. A new ally for Cersei?It’s not novel to see Cersei scheming – Lena Headey could do herself an injury with such frequent scowling – but it’s certainly interesting to see Oberyn Martell conniving alongside her. It makes sense for the prince from Dorne to align with the powerful Lannisters, but who’s Cersei hoping to avenge?3. Daario 4 Daenerys…Nashville’s Michiel Huisman has replaced British actor Ed Skein in the role of mercenary Daario Naharis and he’s clearly being positioned as a swaggering hero. Well, we viewers are fond of Daenerys, so we need to root for any man trying to win her heart. Though it means poor Ser Jorah remains firmly rooted in the friendzone.MORE: Game of Thrones season 4 trailer promises vengeance and justice4. Big battles, big budgetsSeason 2’s climactic Blackwater episode famously cost HBO millions and judging by this thrillingly large shot of Daenerys’ Unsullied firing on a city, the network’s more than happy to pump cash into Game of Thrones. A later aerial shot of a statue above a settlement echoes the Argonath sculptures in The Fellowship of the Ring; showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss have lofty ambitions.5. Dany’s children get hungryWell, haven’t they grown? Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal – though their names haven’t actually been used in the show – have tended to behave, unless told otherwise by their ‘mother’. But judging by the savagery the dragons display in the new trailer, Daenerys will soon struggle to keep a leash on her boys. Fiery death from above could be imminent in the Seven Kingdoms.6. Tywin v Tyrion ‘We mustn’t disappoint father,’ says The Imp, bitterly, as his father mysteriously sits on the Iron Throne. The elder Lannister has always been the power behind his grandson Joffrey’s reign as king, but has he now appointed himself as de facto ruler? And where’s Joffrey?7. Jon’s regretThere’s a genuinely intriguing climax when sweet Samwell Tarly pleads with Jon Snow, only to be met with the reply ‘I’ve done plenty wrong’. The bastard might be referring to his ‘betrayal’ of the Night’s Watch while undercover with the wildlings. Or he could mean his carnal oath-breaking with Ygritte. But a blazing final shot suggests Jon is going to take a man’s life. Will it be a wilding or one of his ‘brothers’ among the watchers on The Wall? The answer could define Jon’s future.

90	 As HBO continues to ramp up the hype for the upcoming season of Game of Thrones, they’ve released a third teaser trailer for season four, called “Secrets.”As we saw in the series’ two previous trailers (here and here) political tensions are rising in Westeros and the events of the Red Wedding are weighing heavily on several characters’ minds. Many of the characters can also be seen questioning their positions. Note Cersei Lannister asking new character Oberyn Martell, “what good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?” What good, indeed.April 6th can’t come soon enough for GoT fans.	Entertainment

		HBO's fantasy show will be screened on Sky Atlantic starting April 7A new trailer for the fourth season of Game Of Thrones has been revealed – scroll down and click to watch. The clip includes several of the show’s main characters including Emilia Clarke’s Daenerys Targaryen, Peter Dinklage’s Tyrion Lannister and Kit Harrington’s Jon Snow, as well as other regulars such as Charles Dance’s Tywin Lannister and Maisie Williams’ Arya Stark.Speaking previously about the new series, executive producer David Benioff said: “Some of the most shocking and mind-blowing scenes of the entire series come at the end of this coming season. This is definitely the most dangerous season for Tyrion [Lannister]. It seems like almost every episode he’s in jeopardy of getting his head removed from his shoulders.”The show’s fourth series will see an influx of new characters joining the cast, with Sherlock actor Mark Gattis and Gangs Of New York‘s Roger Ashton-Griffiths both joining the production. Meanwhile, the role of Prince Oberyn Martell will be played by Chilean actor Pedro Pascal. Pascal’s CV includes recurring roles on US TV series The Good Wife, Graceland and Red Widow. Prince Oberyn Martell is also known as The Red Viper. In the novels, he’s a lusty, hot-headed character with a quick wit and sharp tongue who’s rumoured to be bisexual.The show will premiere on Sky Atlantic on April 7 at 9pm, and will be broadcast just 24 hours after it is shown in the US on the HBO network. Game Of Thrones, which is adapted from George RR Martin’s series of fantasy novels A Song Of Ice And Fire, has been a huge hit since premiering in 2011 and has won numerous television gongs including Golden Globes, BAFTAs and Emmys. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIASaUUwklk"	Entertainment

93	"March 10, 2014 By Lee R More details have emerged around the way the story of Game Of Thrones will turn in the new series. The forth series of the show, as popular as it is controversial, will be broadcast from April 2014. This series will see the Game Of Thrones series move away from the novels by George R.R. Martin and develop their own story, although author Martin will remain involved with both story development and screenplays.With three series of plot twists and shocking turns behind it, fans can expect more of the same from the new season. The biggest new development to the Game Of Thrones saga is the arrival of Oberyn Martell, a sworn enemy of the Lannister family. The character will be played by popular actor Pedro Pascal, well known for his work in the TV series Lights Out and the movie The Adjustment Bureau. The series will focus on the constant threats to the Lannister family as others try to take the Iron Throne by force, as well as the rise of the ‘White Walker’ army. Emilia Clarke, recently announced as being cast in the pivotal role of Sarah Connor in Terminator 5, will return as Daenerys Targaryen, the mother of dragons and leader of an ever increasing in size army of freed slaves. Stannis Baratheon, played by Stephen Dillane, will be shown to continue building his army on Dragon Island, convinced that he is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. 

In respect of who currently sits on the Iron Throne, fans will are eagerly wanting to find out the fate of King Joffrey, a character considered to be one of the most evil, irredeemable and unpleasant ever to feature in a TV series. Rumours indicate that the actor playing Joffrey, Jack Gleeson, intends to quit Game Of Thrones due to the attention and abuse he gets for playing the part.
No significant departures from the series have been confirmed by HBO, the channel that makes and shows the series, but in the world of Game Of Thrones fans have become accustomed to popular characters dying unexpected and often gruesome deaths.

First published on Mon 10 Mar 2014 11.00 GMT

The fourth season of Game of Thrones is looming like an armour-clanking phalanx, ready to maraud into your social life from 7 April onwards.The newest trailer for the series launched last night in the US, during the finale of True Detective, and all the usual political power-plays, backstabbing intrigue and massive fantasy battle sequences all seem to be in place – Daenerys is massing her dragons and sounding ultra-tenacious, while Tyrion and Tywin continue their lip-curling fiendishness. Reading on mobile? Click here to watchIn the very lightly spoilery words of HBO, who released a synopsis of the forthcoming series last week, the season will look a little like this:""Encouraged by the Red Wedding slaughter in the Riverlands that wiped out many of their Stark nemeses, the Lannisters' hold on the Iron Throne remains intact … but can they survive their own egos, as well as new and ongoing threats from the south, north and east? While an unbowed Stannis Baratheon continues to rebuild his army in Dragonstone, a more immediate danger comes from the south, as Oberyn Martell, the Lannister-loathing 'Red Viper of Dorne' arrives at King's Landing to attend Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, and perhaps act on an ulterior agenda. In the north, a depleted Night's Watch seems overmatched against the inexorable Wall advances of Mance Rayder's army of wildlings, which in turn is being trailed by an even more formidable foe: the undead White Walkers. As if that weren't enough, Daenerys Targaryen, accompanied by her menacing trio of dragons and army of Unsullied, is poised to liberate Meereen, the largest city in Slaver's Bay, which could ultimately provide her with enough ships to sail to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne.""The season premiere is on Sky Atlantic on Monday 7 April at 9pm."

A new international trailer has been released for period horror movie The Raven , and itâ€™s stuffed to the brim with grisly, gothic chills. The film sees John Cusack star as Edgar Allan Poe, the renowned author of macabre horror and detective fiction. When a serial murderer appears to have drawn inspiration from Poeâ€™s stories, Luke Evansâ€™ determined detective enlists the writer to help bring the guilty party to justice. However, it soon becomes clear that Poe himself is a target, along with his beautiful girlfriend (Alice Eve). Take a look at the new trailer belowâ€¦ Itâ€™s essentially a truncated version of the original US trailer, a more streamlined teaser that gives away a little less plot-wise, but makes plenty of room for the filmâ€™s grislier pleasures. Its good to see a healthy number of Poe references dotted throughout the trailer, most notably for The Pit And The Pendulum , The Masque Of The Red Death , and of course, The Raven itself. Weâ€™re not quite so sure about casting Poe as a full-on action hero (â€œIâ€™ll send you to hell!â€), but thereâ€™s some nicely knowing humour on display when Evans questions Cusack as to whether many of his stories end in murderâ€¦The Raven will be released in UK cinemas on 9 March 2012.Get the best gaming deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable gaming news and more!GamesRadar+ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Superfans of “Game Of Thrones” might be wondering about a scene, seemingly skipped over from the books, centered around Jamie’s return to King’s Landing and his reunion with Cersei. But as Lena Headey recently told Vulture, it could still be coming. “Well, I can tell you that will, uh … that’s in there. It’s horrendous. It’s kind of crazy,” the actress teased. “Interesting to film, because we were …  she’s in deep pain, and he wants her, because he missed her, and he needs to know she wants him. It’s just a weird, fucked-up moment. It’s quite mad! [Laughs.] Quite mad. And it’s a great transition for him, the loss of someone he doesn’t particularly like, but that he’s connected to, on a deep level.”So think on that while you watch the latest trailer for the fourth, and highly anticipated season of “Game Of Thrones.” Of course, the level of secrecy around the show has always been high, but the past week saw HBO drop the titles and loglines for the first four episodes:






Episode #31: “Two Swords”
Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) welcomes a guest to King’s Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) finds himself unwelcome. Dany (Emilia Clarke) is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya (Maisie Williams) runs into an old friend.Episode #32: “The Lion and the Rose”
Tyrion lends Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a hand. Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery (Natalie Dormer) host a breakfast. At Dragonstone, Stannis (Stephen Dillane) loses patience with Davos (Liam Cunningham). Ramsay (Iwan Rheon) finds a purpose for his pet. North of the Wall, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) sees where they must go.
            Episode #33: “Breaker of Chains”
            Tyrion ponders his options. Tywin (Charles Dance) extends an olive branch. Sam (John Bradley) realizes Castle Black isn’t safe, and Jon proposes a bold plan. The Hound (Rory McCann) teaches Arya the way things are. Dany chooses her champion.
            Episode #34: “Oathkeeper”
            Dany balances justice and mercy. Jaime tasks Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) with his honor.

           What life goals are there beyond being the Mother of Dragons? While that might seem to us like the pinnacle of human achievement, the latest Game of Thrones season 4 trailer focuses on the various aspirations of all our major players. Those goals seem to be, in no particular order, revenge, vengeance, retribution, relation, redress, reprisal, and controlling dragons.In Conversation: Quincy JonesAmerica Is Great, But Olympic Skater Adam Rippon Just Wants to Make Reese Witherspoon ProudBarack and Michelle Obama’s Official Portraits Are RevealedWhat’s New on Netflix: February 2018Every Episode of Black Mirror, Ranked From Worst to BestSee what’s new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBOHomeland Season-Premiere Recap: Welcome to the ResistanceThe Obamas’ Official Portraits Rise to the OccasionAdam Rippon Has Nothing to Say to Mike Pence, Which Is a Shame, Because Everything He Says Is GoldKim Cattrall Does Not Want ‘Hypocrite’ Sarah Jessica Parker’s Condolences at This TimeWhat Made Mirai Nagasu’s Triple Axel So IncredibleWhy rise to the No. 1 spot when you can just buy it?This show could be one of the all-time Star Trek greats.Zac Efron, please take a shower.A former neighbor had accused the singer of groping her at his home in 2016.They join stars Andrew Rannells and Don Cheadle.And it shows no signs of slowing down.Starting March 31.Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald join the canon.Whether for inspiration, fitspiration, or thirst.“You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV.”… some of these five come-from-behind conditions are met.Director Tom Tykwer on the dance clubs, flapper girls, and political violence in his new Netflix show.Parents have complained about a scene where Peter Rabbit uses a slingshot to force-feed a blackberry to a farmer who is allergic to the fruit.Is Reileen the true mastermind of Altered Carbon?Painted by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald.Everyone from Kristi Yamaguchi to Reese Witherspoon reacted. “Reese has been a wonderful support system in teaching me the ways of modernity,” Portman said.“I think we need to get those people who think that I was ripped off on a judging panel immediately.”“We are disappointed that anyone would make such a wrongful comment about either Marlon Brando or Richard Pryor.”The actor was accused of sexual misconduct by five women following his Golden Globes win.© 2018, New York Media LLC.

Catch The Throne: The Mixtape was released by the network earlier today over SoundCloud, and features ten tracks by rap artists including Common, Big Boi and Wale.The album can be streamed from SoundCloud for free, for those curious what the war for the Iron Throne sounds like when translated into rhymes and beats. You can hear the first track up top, and the rest here.Most of the tracks start out with dialogue samples from the show, and if nothing else it makes you realize that many of the characters of Westeros wouldn't be too out of place in modern rap albums.

127	"Digiday’s coverage of SXSW, which runs March 7-11 in Austin, Tex., is sponsored by Dstillery, the pioneer in audience targeting for brands.There’s a brand installation at South by Southwest so immersive a woman momentarily thought on Friday morning she was going to die in it. Scared that she about to plunge hundreds of feet to her death, she screamed “Oh, my God!” — and started inching back from the abyss that yawned before her.But in reality there was no abyss: The woman was on an inches-high platform at Austin Music Hall, where HBO has set up a virtual reality experience that transports users to Westeros, the fictional setting of HBO’s hit show “Game of Thrones.” And even if she did trip and fall, Tony Berger, CEO of Relevent, the experiential marketing agency partly responsible for the installation, was there to catch her.The installation uses the popular Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and tactile cues to give users the sensation that they’re scaling The Wall, a several hundred foot ice fortification that prominently features in the show. The headset’s immersive display changes realistically along with the user’s head movements, allowing users to determine what they want to look at. Meanwhile the floor vibrates to make participants feel like they’re in a squeaky elevator and fans blow cool air to remind them they’re atop a giant block of ice.Here’s a video of this reporter experiencing the installation.
The installation took three months to create, Berger said, with Relevent working with visual production company Framestore to perfect it. (Framestore also worked on the visuals effects for “Gravity,” for which it won an Oscar.)When Framestore isn’t winning Oscars, it’s a digital agency, working directly with brands like Beats by Dre to create digital experiences. For Mike Woods, founder of Framestore’s digital department, the installation is both a sign of how far brands have come in terms of their willingness to experiment with digital and the future of immersive storytelling for both advertisers and media companies.Download an excerpt of our latest issue of Digiday magazine“Advertisers have spent the last year trying to get their websites to be more immersive,” he said. Woods said automotive brands could use this kind of technology to stage virtual test drives while retail brands could show a digital mockups of different home furnishing styles. Media companies will be able to use the Oculus Rift to create media that was previously unthinkable. And while the Oculus Rift is typically viewed as a gaming device, the “Game of Thrones” experience hints that it may open new forms of video entertainment.The installation also underscored how much more daring agencies and brands have become technology-wise, Woods said. Eight years ago, Woods was creating banner ads. Now he’s making people feel as though they might plummet to their deaths in the fictional land of Westeros.“The fact that they’re willing to back unprecedented tech work is a big step,” Woods said. “A few years ago, if it hadn’t been done before, they’d be very afraid to put big bucks behind it.”Join Digiday+ and get Digiday magazine with your membership.Get Digiday's top stories every morning in your email inbox.Follow @Digiday for the latest news, insider access to events and more."

HBO recreated the interactive exhibit of its popular TV series, currently on display at the SXSW conference and festival in Austin.(Photo: Rick Jervis)AUSTIN – Few people can claim they ever ascended to the top of the 700-foot-tall Wall of Westeros in a Castle Black elevator and witnessed an attack by the Wildlings – and lived to tell of it.In what's sure to become one of the more popular draws at SXSW, HBO has set up a nearly 5,000-square-foot exhibition of their hit show Game of Thrones that allows fans to experience the costumes, props, tragedy and magic of the series.The Austin Music Hall downtown has been transformed into a virtual Westeros, the fictional continent where Game of Thrones takes place. Fans enter the exhibit through black drapes and could peruse costumes worn by characters such as Bran Stark, Hodor, Arya, the Hound and Daenerys Targaryen.""We wanted to give fans a sense of what went into making the show,"" said Elana Loewenthal, HBO's director of international marketing, who oversaw the creation of the exhibition.There are original costume sketches for the series, storyboards and props such as a Jaime Lannister's ""golden hand"" and the enormous severed head of the wolf Grey Wind. A glass case displays the various hatchets, daggers and swords used in the show, while volunteers encourage visitors to sit in the coveted Iron Throne for a quick photo opp.But the centerpiece of the exhibit is the ""Ascend the Wall"" experience, a 90-second virtual immersion into the world of Westeros. Visitors climb into a wooden elevator and slide on an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and a pair of headphones. Suddenly, snowflakes flitter about and the elevator rattles and starts to ascend. The visitor feels the lifelike sensation of being pulled up by the rickety lift to the top of the 700-foot iced Wall, used in the series to keep out Wildlings and other aggressors.At its apex, the visitor turns and walks out of the elevator and down a snow-covered path to the edge of the Wall and a striking panoramic view. A cold breeze rustles through. Suddenly, a flaming arrow, shot from way down below, whistles nearby. Another one hits the user square in the chest and he tumbles down the face of the wall, just before the experience – mercifully – ends.The immersive experience combines the latest in interactive technology and computer graphics generated by Framestore, winner of this year's Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for its work on the film Gravity, said Ian Cleary, of Relevent, which oversaw the production. The experience combines 40 different elements – including sound, sights, air blasts and physical movement – to create the immersion effect, he said.""It's very innovative,"" Cleary said. ""Basically, we're tricking your brain into thinking it's somewhere it's not.""Terrence O'Brien, a journalist with engadget.com who tried the experience, said it was extremely lifelike, though didn't offer much connection to the show besides the environment. Still, it was nerve-rattling, he said.""For a guy who's afraid of heights, it was terrifying,"" O'Brien said. ""Pretty realistic.""Austin is the second U.S. stop for the Game of Thrones exhibit, which spent time in New York City during the Super Bowl earlier this year, followed by a tour in Mexico City, said Janine McGoldrick, an HBO spokeswoman. Next, the exhibition will head to Rio de Janiero, Oslo, Toronto, Belfast and Vancouver.Unlike the New York exhibit, which was available only to Time Warner Cable customers, the Austin display is free and open to the public and runs through Tuesday."

	LINDSAY Lohan plans to stay in control and live ""with integrity"", she said on her new documentary series last.

	The troubled actress - who has endured a string of legal problems in recent years and been to rehab six times - is determined to make a fresh start and wants to put her problems behind her.

	Speaking on her new docu-series 'Lindsay', which debuted in the US last night, she said: ""Living with integrity and in control of my own self - that's the life I want now...

	""I'm excited to start this new chapter, so it's going to be good.""

	The 'Mean Girls' star was also seen telling programme director Amy Rice that she now has ""inner peace"".

	She said: ""I'm in this really good place where I have this inner peace right now. All the distractions and chaos that go on outside just in daily life in general don't really affect me anymore.""

	The programme also saw Lindsay search for an apartment in New York and left devastated when she found one she liked - but was told it required a $10 million insurance policy.

	She exclaimed: ""I can't do that. I'm not Oprah!""

	The 27-year-old actress stayed in a hotel while apartment hunting, and after a month in the luxury residence, she admitted she was finding the experience upsetting because she associated it with a ""crazy phase"" in her life.

	She said: ""It's the first time I'm really getting a place in New York and it's really chaotic.

	""I'm trying to figure out how to be sane and live, how to live out of a hotel, which I did when I was in a crazy phase in my life and that brings up a lot of memories and I hate it. ... And now I'm figuring out everything for myself with things being left up in the air constantly.""

	However, she insisted her housing struggle wouldn't send her out of control again.

	She added: ""I'm here. I'm showing up. I'm sober. And I'm dealing with it.""

133	Much of my identity has been shaped by Lindsay Lohan — or shall I say, the more wholesome Lindsay Lohan.Grace Wang | Daily TrojanAs a small child, I watched The Parent Trap almost every day until my mother, an onlooker with less exposure than I, could even recite the words. Freaky Friday marked my third-grade existence; I wanted to be just like Anna: in a band and resilient against snobby popular girls. I sported a black choker for months to emulate her style. Of course, the form of Lindsay Lohan that is most embedded in the very fabric of my life is her character in Mean Girls. I quote it an annoyingly frequent amount of times a day and hope that maybe someday I’ll embody as much grace as Cady when she won Spring Fling Queen, breaking off pieces of her tiara for everyone in the crowd.Nowadays, the Lindsay we are all familiar with is the Lindsay that parties an exorbitant amount, the one that checks in and out of rehab and seems to always miss her various court dates. Her escapades in recent years have infiltrated all media outlets and her actions are sometimes bigger news than breaking international events. She has tried to reinvent her image countless times, and as someone who has followed Lindsay for years and even idolized her at one point, it was increasingly disappointing to see her repeated downfalls. Eventually, her news became tiring, and I just resorted to watching Mean Girls for the 100th time.On March 9, Oprah Winfrey premiered a reality show on her channel, OWN, documenting Lindsay as she picks up the pieces of her life following her very public battles with substance abuse and the law. Clips from Lindsay show the actress saying she “felt like she’s in a prison” with the camera crew constantly surrounding her and Oprah intervening, telling Lindsay to “cut the bull” for missing work. The series is an extension of the Lindsay we have all been accustomed to in the media, yet it also explains her actions. She is perceived as a party girl, but there is a back story to go along with it. Without sounding too maudlin, this series allows the audience to understand her difficult childhood and the pressures of being a child star.Though I do commend Oprah for using her immense power to inspire change, I question, in this case, if her influence is used in the right way. Utilizing the documentary as a means of casting light on Lindsay’s flaws isn’t the type of programming one would expect from Oprah. People are curious about Lindsay’s life, and their curiosity generates ratings. Lindsay’s life — successes and failures — is used for capital gain. As a person whose life was put under a microscope, which ultimately was one of the factors that her career was put in jeopardy, Lindsay would not benefit from even more cameras in her life. Furthermore, reality television shows should be taken with a grain of salt, because sometimes the production entails for dramatic set-up.Technicalities aside, Oprah’s new show does lead me to question why viewers, myself included, are interested in Lindsay’s not-so-shining moments at all. Is it because her life is so chaotic that it’s almost a source of entertainment for people to view it seemingly uncensored? Or is it because we want to support her as an underdog? Either way, discriminating against Lindsay’s troubles invites generalities about her life. Making these matters public allows people to focus on the trivial rather than expending their energy on something more useful.Lindsay Lohan has had a past that is undoubtedly widely covered by the media. It is also a past that people have widely analyzed. Whether she decides to direct her path toward her Disney hey-day is not up to anyone, nor is it anyone’s business.But if she were to make another film with the same brilliance as Mean Girls, that would be so fetch. Danni Wang is a freshman majoring in psychology. Her column, “Pop Fiction,” runs Tuesdays.	Entertainment
134	1The hourlong premiere of Oprah’s eight-part docuseries/exposé on Lindsay Lohan is sponsored, at least in part, by the rehab clinic that Lohan attended up until four days before shooting began for Lindsay. There are at least two commercials for the elite rehab clinic, Cliffside Malibu, during the opening hour, which starts following around Lohan in the aftermath of her sixth rehab stint, in July 2013. It’s an uncomfortable juxtaposition and a little surprising. Why would anyone watching Lindsay on a Sunday night on the Oprah Winfrey Network be in the market for addiction treatment in a “luxury estate setting”? The other advertisements are for cat food.Cliffside Malibu, like everyone else involved in this endeavor, is engaged in media doublespeak: As Oprah wants to position herself as a concerned commentator who wants to discover the truth about Lohan, Lohan herself wants to look like a beleaguered but rehabilitating actress with some kind of future. And Cliffside Malibu wants the cachet of being a celebrity rehab center while also manifesting how compassionate and effective it is.All of these entities could be telling the truth, and maybe they are. But the fact that they want to manifest this truth on television—that’s curious. It’s hardly out of the ordinary for Oprah, who especially on her own network is always the voice of reason. And corporations will advertise, as corporations do, in whatever way appears to drive profits.Lindsay Lohan’s motives are less clear—they are always less clear. The first episode of Lindsay is a foray into the intricate web of self-deceit that makes up her personality. She’s oddly natural in front of the cameras that are filming her life—it’s almost reflexive for her to be on camera. It’s when the cameras are off that she seems to lose her bearings. Perhaps it’s because she’s aware of her image—but more, it seems that being filmed calms her basic anxiety that she is still famous, or important, or talented, or beautiful. Lohan, at this point in time, has no private life that she would want to shield from paparazzi or a filming crew: no personal relationships, no children, no addictions or predelictions that haven’t already been scrutinized by the media.AdvertisementLindsay exists entirely just to see whether or not Lindsay Lohan is still a train wreck. To answer questions like, “Why did it get so bad?” and “How does she live with herself?” Lohan has an absurd amount of money, no friends, very little contact with family, and zero trust in another human being. She is superficially adoring of her sister, who is a runway model, and perfunctory with her mother, Dina. She has an entourage of mostly replaceable blonde women who hold her hand occasionally. Hobbies seem to include shopping, sorting through her possessions, and wearing too-pink shades of lipgloss; there is no purpose or direction here, whether that would be in fun, career, or family. Lohan is, depressingly, too empty for any of that.Which is one way of saying that Lindsay is just making a bad thing worse. The docuseries isn’t doing Lohan herself any favors—all the attention is likely to reinforce her addiction, more than anything—and it’s certainly not providing the viewing public with any new insight on the human condition. Lohan is spoiled and entitled, but she’s also so blatantly pathetic that she doesn’t even inspire the righteous indignation that the Real Housewives franchise does. Lohan is not the first performer to succumb so spectacularly to the pressures of fame from a young age—she lives in horrifying bubble of suffocating artifice that rivals even Michael Jackson’s Neverland. But it implicates the audience, to some degree, that her decline happened right in front of our eyes. On our watch, as it were.Perhaps the saddest aspect of Lohan’s life is that she knows what she needs to do. She needs to quit drinking. She needs to work. She needs a home. But like many addicts, as soon as she starts, she gets in her own way. She’s too anxious to face the paparazzi, so she can’t go to her AA meeting. She is trying to rent an apartment, but because of her history, the landlord wants a $10 million insurance policy that she can’t afford. (Even Lohan’s fortune has limits.) She wants to restart her career, but going to a press junket in London and then the Venice Film Festival scares her—because she would most likely be tempted to start drinking again. Even when she agrees to a cameo in a friend’s film, she balks and makes a scene, because the “friend” rewrote her cameo into a speaking part. “I’m not an actress turned model,” Lindsay says, as if this is a significant distinction. “My sister is the model in the family.” It’s a diva moment—but it’s not just a diva moment. Lindsay Lohan is terrified of everything—of being taken advantage of, of being downgraded to an “actress-slash-model,” of not being taken seriously. Of her family and friends. Of addiction, and of not being addicted, too. Of herself, probably. And of imminent obscurity.AdvertisementThere’s no doubt that Lohan created most of her problems herself, and though her issues are very real, she at least has the resources at hand that she could afford to find a way out, if she ever found the will to do so. The series’ most fascinating characters, besides its main one, are her personal assistant, Matt, and her sober coach (sent by Cliffside Malibu), Doug. Both men earn their paychecks through not losing their temper. Matt is almost saintly, though he isn’t above laying out the absurdity of his job to the camera, while Doug is so holier-than-thou that he’s largely ineffectual.It has proved very easy to shame Lohan for who she is. Lindsay offers one bright spot—it makes her not just a caricature of everything that is easy to mock about women in Hollywood, but rather a person with deep-seated flaws and serious issues. All the money in the world isn’t going to make Lindsay Lohan happy, though she still seems to think it might. Lindsay illuminates, mostly, that Lohan’s biggest problem is that she took the celebrity culture she grew up in a little too much to heart.	Entertainment
135	"Lindsay Lohan's highly anticipated OWN docu-series, 'Lindsay,' premiered its first episode last night, March 9. While the pilot ep wasn't as jaw-droopingly intense as we thought it might be, it definitely set the stage for how the series is going to go. As she says on camera, Lindsay is hoping to show the world her truth, which is exactly what her life is like post-rehab. Read on to find out the most eye-opening moments from the series' inaugural episode.""It's comforting to be around my family,"" Lindsay reveals to the camera. ""They're a big part of my recovery."" While Lindsay's home life has been notoriously unstable (her mom Dina is often seen as an enabler and her dad Michael has wreaked havoc on the actress's life), she is close with her mom and three siblings.""I hate hearing people that I love cry, especially my mom, because it kills me,"" Lindsay reads aloud from a diary she kept while in the Betty Ford clinic in 2012. Soon after, Lindsay gets angry when rehashing the incident that lead to her mom's tears, which was that Dina wasn't allowed to visit her daughter while in rehab. Still, there are happier moments with Lindsay's fam, like when she is beaming with pride (even getting choked up) when her sister Ali models in a fashion show.""Look at my watch,"" one paparazzo proudly shows off to the camera. ""Lindsay paid for it.""One good shot of the actress can make a paparazzo rich, but it leaves the actress with little privacy and, quite literally, a roadblock to her recovery.“We’ve been stuck in the [hotel] room all day because there’s like 40 paparazzi outside and I really don’t feel like dealing with them today,” she told the camera, adding that she feels like a ""prisoner all the time"" due to the intense scrutiny. The actress declined to go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting later that evening due to the paparazzi and her belief that it wouldn't be fair to the rest of the group.In 2008, Lindsay Lohan was a victim of 'The Bling Ring,' the group of wealthy Los Angeles teens who burglarized celebrities' homes, later made famous in the Sofia Coppola film. But while Alexis Neiers, the leader of the Ring, was serving a brief amount of time in jail for her actions, Lindsay was right next to her serving time for her own.""When I was put into jail,"" Lindsay recalls, ""I was put into solitary, obviously for safety purposes. The  girl [Alexis Neiers] I guess was in the same pod next to me, and they released her,"" Lindsay said.""Once someone promises me something and they break that promise, I lose all trust in them,"" Lindsay says. ""That happened to me when I was a kid, with my dad.""In the first episode, we see her trust issues shine through when she has a meltdown over a lingerie film shoot she agreed to help out with for a filmmaker friend. When the filmmaker changes the script on her (something they did not agree upon in their initial contract), Lindsay gets visibly upset and storms out of the room, crying and yelling about the incident and the sudden change in plans.At the beginning of the episode, Oprah asks the starlet what she wants out of filming this documentary. Lindsay responds that she wants people to see her for who she is.""I'm here. I'm showing up. I'm sober,"" Lindsay claims at the end of the episode. ""And I'm dealing with it.""We're rooting for you, Lindsay! Tune in to the second episode of 'Lindsay,' airing next Sunday night, March 16, at 10 PM on OWN.Subscribe to our newsletter"	Entertainment

Breaking News!


We all know that Lindsay Lohan has lived the majority of her life in the public eye. Now 27, the actress bagged her first major film role - The Parent Trap - at just 11. We all know the rest - the drugs, the drink, the rehab, the prison, the driving offences, the parties, and now the attempt to turn things around... with the help of Oprah.Lindsay was billed as an all-access look at Lindsay's path to recovery, but it wasn't afraid of looking at her past, either, with clips from the various news bulletins and flashes of her evolution on the red carpet and even unnecessary vox pops from members of the public discussing their personal takes on Lindsay. Everyone has an opinion on Miss Lohan, whether it's thinking that she's had her shot or wishing her a recovery with fond memories of Mean Girls (for what it's worth, we're in the latter camp).But those wishing for new insight into Lindsay's life in this docuseries would be left feeling faintly disappointed. Lindsay - terrified of ruining what everyone keeps telling her is her last chance - speaks mostly in platitudes in her pieces to camera, speaking of her new ""inner peace"" and ""integrity"" and ""keeping calm amid chaos"" and similar pre-rehearsed phrases.Otherwise, we track her attempt to move out of a hotel into an apartment, where she's hoping for a new stability. So there are lots of shots of Lindsay sorting through her belongings - girl is a big hoarder - with the highlight obviously her discovery of a 'Fetch' shirt at her mother's house.That's not to say there aren't flashes of insight. At one point, trapped in her hotel by paparazzi, Lindsay sits on her floor, sorting meticulously through her jewellery. ""Do you ever feel like a prisoner?"" she's asked. Laughing, as if it's an idiotic question, she replies: ""Yes, all the time."" It's hard not to feel for her, as clearly it's going to be much harder for Lindsay to get her life back on track than for anyone else.Sure, she might have a sober coach with her at all times, but she's unable to go to her AA meeting without a trail of paps (and that's hardly fair on the other attendees, she points out). Even searching for an apartment becomes a million times more difficult - which board is going to want Lindsay Lohan in their building?But generally, it's hard to figure out what story Lindsay is trying to tell. When she doesn't go to Venice for The Canyons promo, is she ducking out of her commitments or doing what's best for her sobriety?Is Lindsay Lohan a diva who causes problems on sets, derails a search for an apartment with a trip to a clothes shop, berates her realtor for not trying hard enough, and forces her assistant to move her belongings from one hotel room to another before she gets back? Or is she a troubled woman trying to get her life back on track as people change things around on her, mess her about, use her and put her in situations that are dangerous for her health?Even Lindsay is confused. At one point, she says she's used to living amid the paparazzi and in the media spotlight - so much so that it doesn't affect her. At other times, it's clear that as she dodges the photographers or ends up stuck in her hotel room. It's not as simple as she made out.Yes, the real picture is always more complicated than black and white, but the show makes it too easy to have two conflicting opinions about Lindsay at one time - for example, when she agrees to take part in a lingerie shoot for a friend, only to quit when they change the concept to something she's not comfortable with. While her running out in tears doesn't exactly scream 'ready to be back at work', it's also clear that she's being mucked about. But instead of painting a complex picture of Lindsay, the show just feels muddled.Understandably, Lindsay seems to be trying to paint a picture of happiness - when she speaks about her family, for example, it's in glowing terms, despite their well-documented history of issues. She does nod to this only slightly - ""It really will be nice when that day comes when there's no more talking and there's only positive things being said"" - and she does later hint at her problems with her father.There's always the sense that things aren't as great as she's making out. Instead of exploring this or helping her talk through what's going on, Lindsay seems content to accept her statements at face value. This isn't insightful for the viewer or, indeed, helpful to Lindsay.The end of the episode comes with a preview for the rest of the season, complete with Lindsay cancelling filming, arguing with her father and being told to fix up by Oprah. But should we really be making drama out of this woman's struggles and difficult road back to health?While I've complained about the lack of real insight into her life in the first episode, when the preview comes along it's hard not to feel uncomfortable. Lindsay's lived everything in front of the media's glare and it hasn't turned out so well for her. Is sticking her in front of a camera crew at one of her most vulnerable moments really a good idea?Lindsay is very glossy and shiny and well-filmed and shot by an Emmy-nominated director in Amy Rice, but that doesn't make it any more of a docuseries and any less of a reality show. Unfortunately, it never scratches much further than the surface, making it hard to justify.I'm hoping for the best for Lindsay - and have for some time now been banking on a comeback - but this show just seems like a potentially dangerous waste of her time.What did you think of Lindsay?

137	Lindsay Lohan is telling pals that she is STILL completely sober after she raised eyebrows Sunday night with her confession that it’s hard for her to go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings because of pesky photographers.In her self-titled documentary on OWN Sunday night, an antsy Lohan, 27, suddenly decided she had to get an entirely new room in the same hotel where she’d been staying in a New York hotel for 36 days.Lohan, a source told Radar, is “in a really good place right now… she is doing what has been asked of her by the court in her lying to cops case. She tries to get to AA meetings, but because she is a celebrity, it’s always an issue.”PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Been In RehabEarlier in the episode, an assistant had sounded optimistic about a new life for the former Mean Girls‘ star, who is now better known for her arrests than her acting.“If she screws this up — she knows what’s at stake,” the man said.An insiders close to Lohan said, “Lindsay would hardly even allow housekeeping in the room to clean. She was afraid someone was going to take pictures and sell it to the tabloids. The level of paranoia with Lindsay is terribly high, sadly.”PHOTOS: Hall Of Shame: The Lohan Family Mugshot AlbumDuring Sunday’s premiere, which is a documentary series about Lohan’s life after getting out of rehab, the actress was shown storming off the set of a lingerie shoot and ranting to her real estate agent.“My intention is to just be me,” the recovering alcoholic told Oprah Winfrey in starting her new TV journey.Viewers also saw the drama of Lohan moving back to New York and looking for a new apartment in Soho.PHOTOS: Linsay Lohan Gets Police Escort In LondonBut when Lohan finally found a place she liked, the recovering party girl was convinced her real estate agent, Cash Bernard, wasn’t working hard enough to seal the deal!In a tense phone conversation with Bernard, Lohan said: “What EXACTLY is it going to take to get the keys?! I hear it in in the tone of your voice, how lackadaisical you are about it.”After finding out a $10 million liability policy had been put in her lease, Lohan went ballistic, shouting to Bernard over the phone: “They can’t just add that to the lease! How the hell can anyone have that?! I’m not Oprah. I can’t get that!”	Entertainment

Seriously, we NEVER thought we'd see the REAL Lindsay Lohan!And by real LiLo, we mean crying, shouting, flipping out Lindsay! We guess that's what she meant when she said she said her intention was to ""be me.""The best moment though, and there were so, so many, was probably when she had a full on breakdown at her lingerie shoot.Ch-ch-check out the clip of it (above) and see some of our other favorite moments from last night's show (in GIFs)…AFTER THE JUMP!!!We met Lindsay's sober coach, Michael Cormier! He's got a tough job, especially because it seems like Lindsay really doesn't want to get better. She'd rather just be Lindsay!She mentioned Alexis Neiers (but not by name)!

Plus, she tearfully warned people NOT to put words in her mouth during her breakdown (above)!She, also, made sure to remind the world that she's not Oprah.And when she couldn't get the apartment she wanted, she asked for a new room in her hotel. But she didn't move all her stuff, that's what her Personal Assistant is for! Duh! We felt bad for him, because there was A LOT of stuff!From the first episode alone, we already can't WAIT to see what else is in store for us this season!!

she's a whining cry baby. and did i hear her say that she can't get a sponsor because she's living in a hotel? many people in recovery live in half way houses or homeless shelters and they mange to get sponsors. she's such a lame ass bullshitter. no wonder everyone is tired of her antics. I'm sure we'll see the worst of her at the beginning then oprah will help her redeem herself at the end. my guess is that it is partially scripted like all other reality shows. I won't be watching again. I wonder what the ratings were.
what a self-entitled brat!!!
I missed it… How do I watch it on repeat?
Inserting 'dialogue' or scripting… changes it from a docu-series into fiction.
A documentary merely documents her life. Stage it, and it becomes a show.
Effing LOSER.
 Who WHO in their right mind would even consider doing business with her or her parents?
Gawd.
Unbelievable! This girl will end up cleaning toilets in the mansions she used to get invited to.  A truly hopeless case.
self centered bitch she must be hell to work with
Note how she says she doesn't want to be a turned actress into model. bwahahaha She is neither. When will that fact sink  in?
Re: Roz –    She is unemployable.
Wait was this scripted or was this real?.
What an insufferable little twit!
Re: OMG –   they are all insufferable twits!
why do people keep working with her if she acts like that? stop rewarding bad behavior!

Probably lost in that naaaaaasty hoarding mess of crap. This girl is beyond disgusting.
Does she not understand that buying an insurance policy doesn't mean you need to have 10 million dollars? That, along with a long list of things are worrisome.
hahahahahahaahah that is so funny Perez, well that's her body, she can wear a bra or not that's her business wright ? but again your post is so funny, thank you !
I love Lindsay, I would love to see her reality show, hope they will air it in Asia TV channel
What are the odds makers giving on how long before she ODs ?And when that happens, I hope they blame Oprah as an enabler
she suprisingly comes across as entitled and narccissistic.  I liked her until i saw this. she looks like a Regina George, dare i say it
Her girls look like everybody has been hanging on them.
How do you always find a way to make fun of people?
you're so lame it makes me wanna waste my time and comment. her tits are awesome. it's not her fault you're too gay to freaking take it. and it's definitely not her fault you can't get her sassy humor because of your ""too gay to function"" head. honestly, I would definitely beat the shit out of you, in the face, if I ever happen to be too unfortunate to see you, because you're obnoxious unnecessary existence annoys the fuck out of me. just die already!  I feel awful that I had to go on your lousy excuse of a website. I don't know how someone can regularly go on your blog and be genuinely cool. you make pink look pathetic. there, I wasted 5 minutes of my time.
Well, I gave it a shot….gave the lying skank one chance to see what she had to say by watching about 5 minutes of this stupid show and as expected all that dribbled out of her mouth were lies. Says her first voluntary rehab was for ambian addiction.Really ???? And her last rehab????? She was just so ready and so committed to change????? She was court ordered!!! Would she have gone without the court order? That was a vacation  she took in Malibu….long hikes in the woods sounds like a real tough time. Anyone else would have gotten jail and still be there.
    I really don't think she knows the difference between the truth and lies. Everything that comes out of her mouth is delusional lies. And Oprah is just enabling her by supporting her ongoing habits. She's living in an expensive hotel room paid for by Oprah and clubbing every night …paid for by Oprah. But Oprah wants to see her succeed? BULLS**T!!!  The whole thing is scripted. When is the media just going to stop reporting on this scum. How many big comebacks can we handle from blowhan. Come back to what? Certainly not acting.
I seldom wear a bra. Yes, they are uncomfortable. WHO CARES if she wears one or not? BFD.
Some of these comments are bewildering. I like to walk around with no bra just as much as the next woman but come on! She wants to be taken seriously and how can anyone when her nipples are on full display?? She goes bra-less in white tops and in dresses. It makes them look like hanging utters. She's too young to be walking around like that and it doesn't help her cause. Smoking cigarettes all day with her tits hanging out like a dirty hippie. Get it together girl.

Get it, Blake Lively!!The 30-year-old took to Instagram on Monday to show off her fit bod after losing 61 pounds of pregnancy weight in 14 months after giving birth to her second daughter, Ines.

140	Lindsay debuted to lukewarm numbers: Just under 700,000 viewers watched the debut episode of the eight-part unscripted series on her post-rehab life that was filmed in 2013. Oprah snagged the first interview with Lohan after the starlet’s sixth stint in rehab, and part of that deal was this series.OWN president Erik Logan told The Wrap that Lindsay is an attempt to bring younger viewers to the network, whose key demographic is currently women 25-54. And Entertainment Weekly reports that these numbers are far lower than what OWN pulled when Oprah interviewed Lance Armstrong last year.Lindsay ended up being far more about Lohan as a beleaguered figure than an unabashed party girl, which may have something to do with its performance. It definitely seems audiences are more interested in Lohan when she’s a total mess.	Entertainment
141	‘Mean Girls’ star Lindsay Lohan has been tapped for a guest star appearance in the current third season of 2 Broke Girls. The CBS Network confirmed that Lohan would appear in the show’s April 14 episode as a thorn in the side of leading ladies, Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs. Lohan will portray the character Claire Guinness, a soon-to-be-bride, who asks Max and Caroline to make her wedding cake.  During the process, Lohan’s Claire will have trouble making decisions, ultimately driving the ladies crazy. “#2BROKEGIRLS & A “MEAN” ONE: Its true!! Excited to be back on set and work w/ @officialkat and @bethbehrs,” Lohan tweeted following the news of her guest appearance.Lohan joins the ranks of past guest stars Martha Stewart, Piers Morgan and hip-hop artist Chainz. Lohan has most recently appeared in her own docu-series entitled ‘Lindsay’ on Oprah’s OWN Network which debuted this past Sunday, March 9. She has also been seen in Lifetime’s TV movie ‘Liz & Dick’ in the role of Elizabeth Taylor. Lohan’s previous television credits include ‘Ugly Betty’, Fox’s musical series ‘Glee’ and ‘Anger Management’ with Charlie Sheen. Will you be tuning in to watch Lohan in the CBS series?

The network said yesterday the rating among women ages 25 to 54 was the highest for the time period (Sunday at 10 p.m.) in nearly seven months.

Beat by La Toya Jackson?We’re not sure if that’s a great way to start.  But OWN network prexy Erik Logan tried to put a positive spin on Lindsay’s first night, saying:""We knew statistically speaking, from a ratings point of view, that we wanted to bring a different audience to this network.”
It’s true - the premiere last night did grab some younger viewers, with the ratings up 231% from last year with women 18-34.But where are the rest of the key demos?!People, if you’re not watching the dramz on this show, you’re cah-razy!Make sure you tune in for Episode 2!Tags: debut, gifs, la toya jackson, lindsay lohan, oprah winfrey, own, ratings, tv newsThis Nickelodeon Reunion Is All That!Seal Will NOT Be Prosecuted In Sexual Battery Case!

But you will continue to cash the Oprah checks, so don't act all high and mighty.
Hilton Family: 'it's payback time Lavendera, put your banner shirt on and ditch the bicth'
pathetic when a nothing z-lister like latoya jackson can whoop your ass in the ratings. reality will slap her in the face sooner or later. she's only talented and news worthy in her own mind.
to erik logan ….
having a different audience implies that you have one to begin with.
lindsay was, once again an epic fail
when will producers and directors learn that this girl is box office poison?
Pretty respectable numbers considering OWN isnt anywhere as big as MTV, where Miley had her HUGELY advertised Movement, and that only brought in 1 million viewers. Now that is what I would call a flop!  But you were to busy ejaculating all over that mess so its no surprise that you chose to ignore that reality.
I just forgot to look and just forgot it was on.i wouldn't even know where to look for own tv.what the hell is that?oprah but  really should have mainstreamed it..
The show was a train wreck! I had a hard time understanding her when she spoke? She feels so entitled about everything! Someone always gives her another chance & bails her out.
This show should have come out 4 years ago, but now its just boring to watch a spoiled brat girl be given the world on a silver platter over and over and over again and then derail herself because she's such a diva.
meh, who cares?
This girl is a losa…I'm her 15 minutes of fame was up years ago..she chose drugs over a career…she is not an actress in my eyes….so for O to create a show for her is beyond my understanding..clueless on that one…think it will hurt O's career more than help it…what a huge mistake…no one will watch her..she is done..she is like a cold McDonald french-fry.. once good crispy and salty and now cold and greasy!
my co-worker's sister-in-law makes $68 every hour on the laptop . She has been without a job for 8 months but last month her paycheck was $16610 just working on the laptop for a few hours. Look At This,,,,,,,,, WWW.WORKTIN.ℂOM
Considering how little people actually pay for cable anymore or watch live tv, one would expect torrent and streaming links to have mediocre numbers for the rubberneck value- nope! The largest torrent site on the net has less than 3000 download total. FAIL.
Hilton, you know damn well that the viewing public is missing absolutely NOTHING by not watching this travesty.  How many people watched simply because of the ""freak factor""?Once they saw the ""old Lohan"" oozing out of this new, improved model, I can guarantee you they won't be back.You can put out a story a day for the next six days, but you got to be aware that either people don't give a rat's ass about this woman or they are repulsed by her.She pulled in 693,000 viewers for the premier?  Those numbers don't even put it in the top 100 cable shows for Sunday night.  I can guarantee you that Oprah is having second, third, and fourth thoughts about ever giving Lohan the time of day, let alone paying her, renting her expensive digs and buying all kinds of crap for her.Wait until you see next weeks numbers.  Winfrey will have a freaking cow.
actually I love to see it, hope they will air the show in Asia TV Cable soon, good luck Lindsay
she seems so disengenuine
The dumb bitch sucks at life. Who's gonna hire her after this crappy show?
The Tijuana donkey how has openings. But she would have to be sober and show up on time.
what is wrong with Americans who watched this shit ? ! ?
I would watch it IF it showed that 'leaked video' where, alledgedly, she and Gerard Butler, HIGH, are doing each other.  Problem is, they are both SO stoned, he is rubbing his stub of a c*ck in her armpit, thinking it is her twat, and she is going down on his big toe, thinking it is his peen !  At Bev Hills parties they show this after the coke service !   Alledgelly…..
What is ""wrong"" with America???? SERIOUSLY????? Here is what is ""Wrong"" .. people are sick of her. She is pathetic. NOBODY cares about her anymore and NOBODY wants to hear more of her lies.
OWN doesn't get high ratings in a lot of their shows. It's not just LINDSAY. She brought high ratings to both ANGER MANAGEMENT and CHELSEA LATELY. This is NOT the entirety of the Lindsay Lohan Comeback. She's continuing to work on herself. She's trying to get her life and her career back and I applaud and respect her for that. I wish her luck!
Re: April9999 –  why do t you STFU and get lost. Who r u to judge LILO!? You're a waste of space and if you wanted her to go away you wouldn't have posted a comment or searched for her in general. You're a joke. A loser. The whole country is NOT SICK OF HER! You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. When you go a century without fucking something up, then judge others.

144	The 27-year-old Mean Girls actress must have found something to occupy herself at LA’s famous party venue the Chateau MarmontLeopards struggle to change their spots, and so do LiLos. Just hours before she was seen telling Oprah Winfrey she is through with partying, Lindsay Lohan pulled a 48 hour bender.Standard behaviour. On Sunday night, the former actress, 27, said: “There’s no party that I haven’t gone to, there’s no person that I haven’t hung out with, there’s no situation that I haven’t been exposed to.” And she insisted: “There’s nothing left in having a drink for me.” But she must have found something to occupy herself at LA’s famous party venue the Chateau Marmont, as I can reveal she was there until 5am on Saturday morning. And something kept her amused enough to go on to a house party.She can’t be too done with fun times, because she was back partying at the hotel later that evening, too - and she remained there until the early hours of Sunday morning.[Clearly, it should be pointed out that the hotel has lifted Lindsay’s ban from the place - she was temporarily barred after she failed to pay a £30k bill.]I’m told: “Lindsay started on Friday night at the cocktail bar at the Beverly Hills hotel, before moving on to the Chateau.“She was out in the garden until early in the morning, and then the group moved on to a house party in the Hills.“Literally hours later she was back in party mode at the Chateau again.”And while she was recovering the next night, the first episode in an eight part documentary following the star aired on OWN.In it, she skipped an AA meeting because her apartment was surrounded by paps. She admits that booze is her drug of choice, but insists she wants to move past her wild partying lifestyle.The interview is the first the actress has given since her last spell in rehab in July 2013 - her sixth stint. She is still required to attend therapy sessions to prevent a relapse.Perhaps they hold them at the Chateau?	Entertainment

Rumors were swirling up the wazoo that Lindsay Lohan was getting a book deal, and it looks like the tell-all is actually gonna happen! If she can stay committed, that is! Esteemed publishing house HarperCollins is ready to offer LiLo a one MILLION dollar deal to turn the journal she kept during her stint in rehab into a book! It's not official yet, but apparently the book is set to be extremely autobiographical and will detail her descent from child superstar to a rehabbed, struggling actress.

After the books by everyone in her trash family there won't be much left she can do. She has no acting talent to speak of and no respectable people will hire her addict ass.

147	"Last night Oprah's OWN network aired the premiere of Lindsay Lohan's reality show, Lindsay, which documents the troubled star's attempt, fresh out of rehab, to get her career going again and stay sober. Nothing could go wrong when you ad a reality show to the mix, right? Join us below, we as review some highlights from the episode.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Oprah's pre-interviews are intense. Before they film an interview that aired on OWN in August, days after Lohan had been released from rehab,  Lindsay tells Oprah that she only wants to come across as herself in the interview. Oprah, smelling the bullshit, tells Lohan ""I'm only interested in what is the truth."" Lohan gulps and nods and then lets Oprah talk her out of going on a potentially sobriety-derailing trip to Europe. It's kind of awesome. Shouldn't this show just Oprah following Lindsay around, tell her not to do things and not breaking eye contact until Lohan agrees?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Much is made of the fact that Lindsay &lt;i&gt;does not have an apartment &lt;/i&gt;in in New York, and must live for like three weeks in a 5-star hotel until she can find a place with a co-op board that will accept her. At first I was like, ""get. over. it.,"" but it's understandable how disorienting and un-fun living out of a suitcase would feel for a person desperate for stability. Not a good idea. Kind of like doing a reality show fresh out of rehab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Living out of a hotel means that she's living out of suitcases and boxes, with much of the show featuring her sorting through clothes, shoes and jewelry laid out in front of her as now sad reminders of her previous success. When she pulls a &lt;i&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/i&gt; t-shirt with &lt;br/&gt;""Fetch"" on the front of it from a box at Dina's house, where most of her belongings are in storage, Dina stares blankly at it. Oh, oh, yes, that's right, &lt;i&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/i&gt;. Cute, hon. Even crazy old Dina has moved on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Lindsay's broker is named ""Cash Bernard."" Cash Bernard is, in Lindsay's opinion, not working as hard as he could to get her into an apartment. Cash Bernard is being ""lackadaiscal"" about the whole thing, says Lindsay of Cash Bernard. Cash Bernard.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;iframe src=""http://www.oprah.com/common/omplayer_embed.html?article_id=48884"" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" scrolling=""no"" width=""640""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""shareTitle""&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
5) Lohan has trust issues, and herself admits that people are always trying to jerk her around. This makes sense, given who her parents are, but one gets the impression watching Lohan become weepier and more explosive during an argument with a director at a lingerie shoot she had agreed to appear, in only to have her role changed without her knowledge, her only defense mechanism in these situations is to explode and act like a huge, bratty baby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) On said lingerie shoot, the grim realities of life as a former child star become plainly obvious. There are depressing one-on-ones with models likely 3 to 4 years younger than Lohan, talking about as her like she's a decades-older old washed-up star who's now a novelty. ""I'm excited to work with Lindsay Lohan,"" says a girl in a bra. ""&lt;i&gt;Parent Trap&lt;/i&gt; was my favorite movie growing up."" This is, where the show shines and shows real potential. While there are certainly one or two awkwardly staged opportunities --going to a fashion show to see her model sister, who seems vaguely surprised to see her there, walk the runway, for one -- the show is seemingly more or less candid. No bullshit staged storylines a la &lt;i&gt;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/i&gt; -- it's all about true intentions. This is Oprah country, y'all. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7) And for all of her own trust issues, people, unsurprisingly, don't trust Lindsay Lohan. When Cash Bernard does finally find her an apartment, she must also put down $10 million for an insurance policy. When Lohan is a no-show at &lt;i&gt;The Canyons&lt;/i&gt; junket in Venice, director Paul Schraeder describes working with LL as like being ""held hostage by a talented but unpredictable actress."" Nope, nothing could go wrong with this Oprah reality show. Not at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8) Constant commercials for Cliffiside Malibu where Lohan did her latest rehab stints adds to the pressure on Lohan to not Totally Screw This Up. The ad's tagline:  ""At Cliffisde, you should only have to do this once."" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;iframe src=""http://www.oprah.com/common/omplayer_embed.html?article_id=48882"" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" scrolling=""no"" width=""640""/&gt;&lt;p class=""shareTitle""&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""shareDescription""/&gt;
9) The paparazzi keep her prisoner in her hotel room, unable to go to an AA meeting, and it's pretty dark. She might not be getting work, but Lohan is still worth tons of paparazzi dollars, one photographer standing outside her hotel room flashing a watch at the camera that he brags Lohan paid for.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10) Despite showing flashes of self-awareness, freely talking about her tendency to self-sabotage, she's also totally oblivious at other times. In one scene, Lohan remarks that in her pre-rehab life she existed in a bubble where everything was done for her, but that now she's more independent and doing things for herself. And then she has her personal assistant scramble to move all of her belongings into a new room in her hotel because she feels like a change of scenery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p/&gt; "	Entertainment

150	“Just Be.” – Lindsay LohanEarly on in Lindsay, OWN’s four part “docu-series” by  Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice, we see Oprah sit down with the former Mean Girls actress and ask her what she wants to get out of her experience. “Just to be,” Lindsay Lohan says. “Just to be honest and open and just…me.” It’s a cringe-worthy moment in a show filled with cringe-worthy moments, made all the more cringe-worthy because you know how bad you are for watching it. But what Oprah says next, to the woman who just came out of rehab and who she just paid $2 million to shoot a documentary about, is even worse.“Okay, because that’s my intention too,” says Queen O. “My intention is to serve as a path for you to be able to do that. And so if I know that’s what you really want to do, I’m going to call you on it when I feel like you’re really not.”You see the problem here, right? Asking a celebrity whose public train wreck has led her to a sixth stint in rehab what she wants, or hey, put ANY person on the spot and ask them what they hope to achieve by being interviewed by Oprah, and you’re going to get a lot of nonsensical, pseudo-self-help nonsense answers. No one is going to say “damage control,” or “money,” or “self-promotion.” And yet Lohan’s meaningless response–“Just be?” Aren’t we all “just being” all of the time, whether or not we are on drugs or honest or in The Canyons or have shitty, terrible parents–is immediately validated by Oprah as being exactly the right answer.In almost every scene of Lindsay, we watch someone validate Ms. Lohan’s addled world-view by agreeing to accept events on her terms. Her drug counselor (who looks exactly like Mike White from Enlightened) lets her stay in her room at the Soho Grand instead of going to AA meetings because there are paparazzi outside. Her personal assistant lets her make iffy arrangements with “friends” who want to use her for a lingerie shoot. The “friends” tolerate Lindsay’s whiny tantrum behavior (which eventually leads to her just leaving the photo shoot, because she doesn’t want to play an intellectual or doesn’t want to have to memorize lines, it’s unclear), because they are succubi hangers-on, just like everyone else in her life.Lindsay Lohan frequently sounds paranoid as she spouts off all the ways every life interaction makes her feel “used” and “lied to,” but she’s not wrong. Shoving a camera in an addict’s face is one way to speed up bad behavior, and unlike other Oprah endeavors, this feels like it’s angling not for a redemption story, but for a massive meltdown. It’s such a blatant kind of transaction–OWN gets the ratings, Lindsay becomes relevant for half a second–that you almost start to not feel bad about watching it. After all, we watch the Kardashians and don’t feel like we are ruining anyone’s lives, right?The difference is, and god help me for saying this, but Kim Kardashian is a wise old soul and a savvy businesswoman, at least compared to Lindsay Lohan, who has no filter for keeping the leeches away. If Oprah wanted to let her “just be,” she would do so not by offering massive amounts of cash in exchange for frontside tickets to the drama, but by…you know, letting her be. At no point does anyone ever tell Lindsay Lohan the truth: that the public is interested in her only as far as she can fall, not for how high she can climb. That it’s not in her best interest to publicize her struggle. That Oprah and her drug counselor and her mother don’t want what’s best for her; they want what’s best for them. And that’s for her to fail.“My family has so much love,” Lindsay Lohan says at one point. “I can’t wait till we get to the point where we don’t need to talk anymore.”Neither can we.We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

151	Lindsay is no Lance.The series premiere of Lindsay Lohan’s reality show on OWN delivered only 693,000 viewers Sunday night.Though that’s higher than the network’s average in the slot, the debut of Lindsay is down from Lohan’s post-rehab interview on Oprah’s Next Chapter last fall, which averaged 892,000 viewers. And both were down hugely from Oprah Winfrey’s previous high-profile celebrity interviews. For instance, OWN’s Lance Armstrong interview delivered 3.2 million viewers last year and its interview with surviving members of Whitney Houston’s family drew 3.5 million viewers two years ago. Critics called the show surprisingly tame. Guess TV viewers are just not all that interested in Li-Lo drama anymore?	Entertainment

154	" Lindsay was supposed to be her redemption song, but it's unlikely that Lindsay Lohan can carry the tune. It was apparent very early on in last night's premiere of the OWN docu-series—particularly when she was shown ditching her AA meetings within days of leaving her sixth stint in rehab—that Lindsay is not doing her step work. So let's run through the 12 steps of watching her show.The first episode of Lindsay focused on the 27-year-old's move to NYC, which involved her sifting though boxes upon boxes of crap—mostly clothing, costume jewelry, and old journals from previous stays in rehab—from a massive, warehouse-like facility of storage units in LA to stuff she had stashed in her mom's Long Island garage. It was never really clear how or if she was organizing anything, as it seemed that she was mostly just rooting through piles for some stuff to wear or bring back to her hotel room.The girl is a hoarder, and so she literally has a shit ton of baggage. She seems completely incapable of getting it in order—or even letting any of it go—and instead just creates a bigger mess every time she's confronted with it. The entire situation is  one big screaming analogy for the way she lives the rest of her life.That higher power is Oprah, obviously.The theme of the first episode revolves around Lindsay canceling stuff—AA meetings, promotional appearances, work commitments, etc. She always had a reason for her decisions. But ""reason"" is also another way to say ""excuse.""AdvertisementIn one scene we learn that the only way Lindsay can afford to get to Venice to promote The Canyons is if GQ pays for her tickets. The only way GQ will pay for her tickets is if she first appears at the magazine's event in London. After discussing it over with her sober coach Mike, Lindsay decides that the promotional appearances are pointless since she has no other work to discuss on the red carpet, and doesn't want to speak about having just left rehab.A few days later she decides to make a cameo in a lingerie ad/short film, but only after the director agrees to work according to her schedule (that is otherwise completely empty), which means that he would have to move his 5 am call time to noon. When she arrives on set (seemingly late), she immediately gets into an argument with the director over the creative direction of the shoot. She insinuates that he lied to her and says that she hates liars. She begins to cry as she tells him that she cancelled her trip to Venice and London just to shoot this lingerie thing with him. Which is a lie, as evidenced by the previous footage.What keeps Lindsay from being a transformative experience for the actress is that she lacks the self-awareness that's necessary for self-improvement. Case in point: At one point Lindsay says she's adjusting after having been ""in this bubble where everything was done for me and now I'm figuring everything out by myself."" However, this is said as a voiceover during a scene in which she—on an angry, petulant whim—instructs her personal assistant to quickly go back to her hotel and switch her room because she is ""sick"" of the one she's been staying in. This involved several people packing at least a dozen large suitcases worth of clothing—that was spread out in a total mess all over the hotel suite—and moving it and unpacking it in a new location. Lindsay did not in any way help with the move.AdvertisementTalking about ""figuring out everything by myself"" while at the same time expecting her assistant to pull off Herculean tasks is demonstrative of the kind of entitlement and willful blindness that prohibits personal growth.It's going to be awfully difficult for Lindsay to work on herself when she surrounds herself with yes-people who are either sycophantic ""friends"" or hired help. How can someone fix their faults if they are told they don't have any?AdvertisementIt was really clear, even in the first episode, that Lindsay lacks the kind of humility it takes to really succeed with her sobriety. This was apparent when she went to a fashion show that her little sister Ali was walking in. It was supposed to be Ali's big day, but Lindsay managed to turn it into a spectacle of her own, throwing a hissy fit when she decided to chew out her realtor on the phone over a contract stipulation in lease she wanted to sign. She hadn't been working or going to meetings. What was she doing during those five weeks after leaving rehab that she simply had to make a call (after business hours) during her sister's moment to shine?Here are the people that appeared in the first episode of Lindsay:AdvertisementAdvertisementIt's at this point that you should turn to the person sitting next to you on the couch and apologize for making them watch this.AdvertisementThroughout the airing of Lindsay, there was an ad for Cliffside Malibu during every single commercial break. It just so happened to be where Lindsay's most recent stint in rehab was completed. Interestingly, Lindsay did not start her treatment at Cliffside. She began at Betty Ford in May 2013, but moved over to Cliffside a month later. Is that because she landed the Oprah interview and show deal, which included complimentary treatment at the advertiser's facility? A private room at Cliffside goes for about $80,000 for a 30-day stay. Lindsay was there for over two months. If she didn't have enough money to fly to Venice, she certainly didn't have $160k to drop on court-ordered rehab.Mike, Lindsay's sober coach on the show, is an employee of Cliffside Malibu.Again, this is Oprah, and we need to see more of her.It's doubtful. Lindsay in Lindsay just seems like same shit, different day. There's nothing deep or meaningful about this experience—so in that regard it doesn't differ much from any of Lindsay Lohan's other work. The bad news is that the only transformation she's made is of that from movie star to reality star. The good news is that she's still entertaining"	Entertainment

156	"Lindsay Lohan’s rehab reality series Lindsay on OWN opened in a highly crowded Sunday 10 PM time slot with about 200,000 fewer viewers than caught Lohan’s highly touted sit-down with Oprah Winfrey on OWN last August. That, in turn, had been a substantially smaller audience than some other Oprah-exclusive sit-downs on her cable network. This, just a few days after Lohan’s visit to Jimmy Fallon on NBC’s Tonight show to plug the launch of the OWN series logged a preliminary 3.2/9 household rating, which will likely translate to about 4 million-ish viewers when Nielsen gets them crunched.Even so, OWN president Erik Logan calls the launch a success, noting Lohan’s opener achieved his network’s highest rating in the Sunday hour in 27 weeks with women 25-54 and that the series launch posted triple-digit gains in key demos versus the time slot’s prior six-week average (+178% in total viewers; +300% in women 25-54; +478% women 18-49), and double-digit gains versus the tim eslot one year ago (+57% in total viewers; +37% women 25-54; +73% women 18-49).“We had set out to try to attract a different type of viewer and audience to the network and we felt like we did that — especially young women demo which is up by triple digits,” he said, calling the demo “people who normally don’t come here.” “We thought this was a great opportunity for us — we feel great about the young end of the numbers, and the premiere in a time slot we never programmed before on a most competitive night of television.” He said the numbers for Lohan’s post-rehab sit-down with Oprah are “a little apples and oranges” because that interview occurred in a franchise that was two-years established — Oprah’s Next Chapter. “This is programming a brand new time period and not an easy place to go,” he said. The premiere episode of Lindsay will re-air on OWN tonight at 10 PM ET/PT.Last August,  Oprah Winfrey‘s post-rehab interview with troubled star Lohan drew far smaller audience than some other of Oprah’s exclusive sit-downs. The Lohan interview on Oprah’s Next Chapter on Sunday, August 18, averaged 892,000 total viewers at 9 PM, only slightly above the show’s Sunday average (+7%). For comparison, Oprah’s interview with Whitney Houston’s daughter Bobbi Kristina drew 3.5 million viewers and her chat with disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong clocked 3.2 million. For the night, including the 10 PM rebroadcast, the Lohan sit-down averaged 1.8 million viewers.Last Thursday, La Lohan was a guest on Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to plug the debut of her OWN reality series, though she explained it away as doing all the reality -TV stunts, like making the most chaos of her move to New York, though she said Oprah herself has helped her a lot and that she sometimes does not pick up calls from Oprah just so she’ll have Oprah’s voice recorded on her voicemale. During a Water War with Fallon, when he’d gotten thoroughly drenched and railed “Why is this happening?!” she responded: “Because I have the power of OWN!”Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy

Oprah wants Lindsay Lohan to win. I do, too. But as I watched Sunday’s debut of the eight-episode series documenting Lindsay Lohan’s recovery, I felt sad. And guilty. Reality TV probably isn’t the best idea for someone fresh out of rehab.Oprah wants Lindsay Lohan to win. I do, too.But as I watched Sunday’s debut of the eight-episode series documenting Lindsay’s recovery, I felt sad. And guilty. Reality TV probably isn’t the best idea for someone fresh out of rehab. But last summer, less than a week after her 90-day stay at Cliffside Malibu (did you catch the rehab center’s commercials during the show?), Lindsay started shooting this docu-series for the Oprah Winfrey Network. Back then, during a one-on-one interview, Oprah encouraged the starlet to reconsider a trip to Europe. The “playground for fun and pleasure” may not be the best decision, is how she put it. But looking at the show — the cameras and Lindsay’s mounting anxiety — I wonder if diving into reality TV is a good choice either. Throughout the episode she talks about inner peace and how chaos doesn’t affect her anymore. But the show tells a different story. She’s just so fragile.Lindsay is in the middle of moving from L.A. to New York. For some reason, she sent all of her belongings east, even though she doesn’t have a home yet. She’s living out of a hotel. And paparazzi are everywhere. These flashing lights are unfortunately part of celebrity. But at one point, she bails out on an AA meeting because she just can’t handle the cameras following her. No one objects. Not even the sobriety coach. Knowing she’s gone to six rehabs in six years, it’s hard to watch her skip a meeting over the paps.But I didn't change the channel. I want to see the change, to catch a glimpse of the freckle-faced, charismatic sweetheart who stole my heart in “The Parent Trap.”Her angst is overwhelming. She’s been living out of boxes for a month. It takes time to find an apartment under any circumstances, but she’s already emotionally worn. There’s a lot, big and small, Lindsay can’t seem to handle. Like going to the Venice Film Festival because everyone will want to talk about rehab. She’s not ready for that. Yet, here we are, tuned into a show directly plugged into her every move post treatment. Irony, much?And when she shows up for a cameo in a short film to promote a lingerie line for friends, she goes into complete meltdown mode when things don’t go exactly as planned. She pulls out of the project. It would have compromised her sanity and sobriety, she says. But New York Fashion Week? She can do that. I understand her sister was walking the runway. It was actually a sweet moment, to see her so proud. But knowing she skipped AA because of cameras, it breaks your heart a little bit.“Living with integrity and living in control of my own self — that’s the life that I want now,” she says. I hope she gets it. From the promos for the rest of the series (airing at 9 p.m. Sundays), we know her sobriety will be questioned and she will have a showdown with Oprah. We know that ads for Cliffside Malibu will air like an infomercial, because good intentions aside, this show is a moneymaker.But what I hope gets addressed is something comedian Russell Brand said in an interview about addiction (heroin was his vice) with Oprah that aired just before Lindsay’s glossy series. “I look to solve inner problems with external things,” he says. “I’ll use anything to stop myself feeling. And as a little kid I was very lonely, very isolated and confused. And anything that could temporarily relieve that, I was very grateful for.“When I got clean 11 years ago I realized that the reason that I was taking drugs was to deal with those emotional issues. And once you stop, when you take drugs out of the equation, those issues remain.”She may be sober, but Lindsay still has issues to tackle. Not for ratings, not for her last shot at success. But for herself, for her life. Otherwise she will be trading one addiction for another. And right now, it looks like she is addicted to the drama for the cameras. Since we’re all glued to our screens, tweeting every scene, I can’t help but wonder if we are too."	Entertainment

It registered a .56 with its key demograhic Women 25-54 rating and .52 Women 18-49 rating.“We feel really good about [the ratings],” OWN president Erik Logan told TheWrap. “Part of what excited us about this project is that we had the opportunity to diversify the network and expand the brand.”The cable network’s exec touts the show’s gains in the 10 p.m. Sunday hour over last year in total viewers and several demos: Up 57 percent in total viewers; up 37 percent with key demo W25-54 and up 73 percent in the younger-skewing W18-49.Also read: ‘Lindsay’ Premiere: Lohan Is a ‘Prisoner’ on OWN Series — ‘It’s My Last Shot’Although the numbers seem on the low side for the original series, Logan said that the network intended for the show to open the network to new and younger female viewers.“We feel really good about the goal that we had set out,” Logan said, “which was one, to tell a good story; two, demonstrate the flexibility of our brand under Oprah [Winfrey]; and three, continue to attract new audiences to the network.”For the younger demo of Women 18-34, “Lindsay” ratings actually ranked third after comparable reality series “Iyanla: Fix My Life” with a .89 and “Life with La Toya” with a .58. “Lindsay” saw an increase in the younger demo in the hour of 241 percent year-over-year.See video: Oprah Winfrey Tells Lindsay Lohan to ‘Cut the Bulls–t’ in First Look at OWN SeriesOWN doesn’t sell ads against Women 18-34, though, like it does for W25-54 and W18-49.In August 2012, Lohan’s appearance on interview series, “Oprah’s Next Chapter,” earned 892,000 total viewers and a .66 W25-54 rating.As different show formats and without the presence of Winfrey, Logan said those numbers aren’t comparable.“It’s really, really hard to compare the two, because Oprah is hosting the show and this is a docu-series around Lindsay Lohan,” Logan said. “Also, that show has a track record of over two years of an audience, this is a premiere of a series that doesn’t have Oprah in it. So, it’s apples and oranges.”	Entertainment

Lindsay Lohan proved to be a decent draw on OWN -- though the performance of her self-titled reality show was down from her fall interview on Oprah's Next Chapter.

The first episode of Lindsay earned 693,000 viewers at 10 p.m. on Sunday night. While hardly a launch high for the growing cable network, it did mark the best unscripted premiere of 2014.

Lohan's episode of Oprah's Next Chapter brought 892,000 viewers in its premiere telecast, getting an extra 504,000 viewers with an adjacent encore.

A network effort to bring in new viewers, Lindsay did skew younger. Among women 18-34, the premiere's .53 rating was up 231 percent from the year prior.

""We knew statistically speaking, from a ratings point of view, that we wanted to bring a different audience to this network,"" OWN president Erik Logan told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday.

Compared to other unscripted efforts, the Lindsay premiere ranks third in that demo behind Iyanla: Fix My Life and Life with La Toya. The total viewers, while modest, gave OWN a six-week high in the Sunday hour.

She really looks like the poster child for Borderline Personality Disorder.  I wonder if she realizes that.
Borderline Personality disorder is when you cant emotionally regulate yourself.  It usually happens to people that have a rough childhood, a bad parent or family life.  It happens when they weren't validated as children.  They can never be alone with themselves they always need someone around. They also self medicate because they just cant stand to be alone with themselves, or feel any pain.  It sounds like addiction isnt the main problem.  It sounds like BPD is.  But then again, I'm not a therapist, just an observer
There is special therapy for Borderline personality disorer. Its called Dailectial Beahvioral Therapy.  I like how she said she wants a life where she has control over herself.  I understand what shes going through.
Thank you for your psychiatric assessment of the situation Dr. Perez. I did not see your credentials after your name. As for handling your scandals behind closed doors, you were advised to do that many times with Lady Gaga. Stick to what you do best.
You said that you never brought the meeting with Lindsey and her managers up publicly but that is not true. You did that in another interview like a year ago.
She can't act and she has a shitty personality.  Time for her enablers to face facts.
Re: Gracie 2004 –     Most of the public can see what enablers refuse to admit - she can't hack it and needs major therapy for many years to come.
Cut the BS excuses for her behavior.
 If she is mentally ill she should not work until her issues are resolved.
If she is the selfish idiot we all think she is, she does not warrant any more help.
Real actresses are never confused as to what is expected of them. Perez is right in his assessment of her.
Lilo  has the perfect biography at mugshotmugz.com
Re: Jamie123x –    What difference does it make what illness she may or may not have?  Investors and producers worry about the bottom line. The point is that you can't hire someone who is in bad shape, the reasons don't matter.
Perez are you taking speech lessons?  I noticed you weren't as irritating as usual.  You have this odd way you speak and it wasn't there today.  Lessons?  If so, great job !!
Disaster and a train wreck. Just go away and take your trash family with you.
Re: Jamie123x –  Yes. I suspect she may have it.
Re: Jamie123x –  They do that at Cliffside where she she was transferred to a few weeks after starting her treatment at Betty Ford.
While Perez is right, Lindsey is a  mess, WHO is he to give her any advice? WHY in the world would her managers bring her to HIM for advice???!!! He is obnoxious and loathesome.
Perez hilton is such an idiot. He runs this shitty blog where the facts arent even accurate most of the time. i am canadian and knaan isnt that bad. he makes knaan sound like some gangster. And when perez pronounced knaans name wrong i laughed. Knaan is a well known rapper in canada and does alot of good work in other countries. Way to go perez. If you did your research you wouldnt be talking shit about knaan.
Attacking Perez does not  change the  fact that Lindz is getting nowhere with her behaviour and lousy attitude. Perez is not the one struggling, she is. I don't see a future for her.
TOTALLY agree with your assessment of Lindsay Lohan - she is an empty shell and until she gets therapy and fills her life with knowledge, work , love, service, or spirituality, she will continue to act out and abuse substances.  It's sad to see her, I watched and felt pity, annoyance and boredom with her - all at the same time.   She is close to 30 and her time is running out as an actress and model.
Lindsay has been better than she has for years. Hilton Family: 'it's payback time Lavendera, put your banner shirt on and ditch the bicth'
Fuck, you sure do have a face made for radio and voice for silent movies.
Re: annainparis –  Are you going to post this on every darn story about Lohan? Because it is getting tiresome.
Talking like you all know Lindsay personally because some shit blogger can't shut up about her is unbelievable. I'm not saying she doesn't have a problem, I'm saying you shouldn't care. I think people like you are part of the problem.
Didn't you learn anything from the incident with Lady Gaga?  What credibility do you have for all this information that you continue to spew?
Perez, you hit the nail on the head.  You spoke the words of truth about the mess we know as Lohan.  But I will add, I honestly feel she has NPD, Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  And I don't think she will ever, ever, ever get cured of it because she thinks she's perfect the way she is - which is a symptom of NPD.  It also explains why she is such a mean, nasty, devoid of empathy, self-centered, self-absorbed, delusional, entitled b!tch who cares for no one except herself.  But you are also right that she is empty inside.  Thank you Perez for speaking the truth about Lohan.  I believe that had she followed your advice, she'd have been on an ethical and moral journey to victory.  Too bad she didn't listen.
Re: RollingMyEyes –  You are so right.  The people attacking Perez are sad, weird people who have problems.  They are bigots who hate the LGBT community and they're venting at Perez because they're scared little people with too much time on their hands and concerning Lohan - don't have their priorities in order.  Little brains.
Oh for the love of god…you've see ONE episode of the show and you have her figured out.  You're such an ass Perez. I now remember why I stopped coming to your site.  Her problems are very real, and it's up to her to figure out how to live her life with an addiction.  She's fucked up before, and will probably fuck up again as part of the recovery process.  And it's people like YOU that add to her many triggers.
Re: BobbieFisher2 –
You're an idiot.  And you're clearly Perez…sad Perez, using one of his aliases.  FO loser.

Get it, Blake Lively!!The 30-year-old took to Instagram on Monday to show off her fit bod after losing 61 pounds of pregnancy weight in 14 months after giving birth to her second daughter, Ines.

164	"Amanda Crum03.10.2014LifeShare this PostLindsay Lohan's docu-series premiered on Sunday night on Oprah's OWN, and while many were expecting non-stop drama in the first episode, some critics found it a little slow and even boring at times.While a preview last week promised an interesting look inside the troubled actress's life, the first episode is mostly about her hunt for an apartment and gives us a look at her everyday life more than the tension between her and her famous family, although that's sure to come in the near future; Lohan does have a meal with her dad which doesn't look like it ends well. ""If you were hoping for a tabloid-style portrayal of Lohan’s “train wreck” existence, you were likely disappointed by the premiere, which presented the actress not only as a recovering addict, but as a hopeful survivor,"" wrote Yahoo's Andy Swift. ""Sure, there was the occasional moment of insanity — I’m still not sure why Lohan found herself at that lingerie shoot, and any scene featuring mom Dina Lohan was pure gold — but for the most part, the premiere took itself very seriously.""However, many who saw the premiere admit that a little ""boring"" might be the key to Lohan getting her life back on track after a slew of legal troubles and battles with alleged substance abuse. In the preview that was released last week, the actress talks about her hard partying ways and says that it doesn't appeal to her anymore because she's done it all.

167	"In the most boring yet simultaneously fascinating piece of television there has been in some time, the Lindsay docuseries premiered on OWN featuring a newly sober Lindsay Lohan in the process of moving to New York under Oprah's Spiritual Guidance. Lindsay seems to be doing really well: she is clearing her life of clutter, listening to her sobriety coach, and staying away from potential temptations. That being said, there will never not be Mean Girls parallels in Lindsay's life.Behold, the fetchest moments of Lindsay:1. Her storage unit is ""I made my parents trade me"" huge. Seriously, is that one singular warehouse? There cannot be more storage units like that in one warehouse.   /strong>2. She can't help it that she's so popular: ""There's no party I haven't gone to, no person I haven't hung out with,"" says the girl whose Fairy Godmother is Oprah.3. It may have looked like she was being a bitch, but that's only because she was acting like a bitch: No seriously, though:  ""I can't compromise myself and my sobriety by being in that headspace, by being stressed out. I'm here, I'm showing up, I'm sober, I'm dealing with it.""4. Unlike Regina George, she'd tell someone if she had the ugliest effing skirt she'd ever seen: ""I don't like being lied to because I don't like to be a liar.""5. The lesson in all of this, I think, is that too many people said to Lindsay, ""Get in, loser, we're going shopping."" And now no one trusts her not to go on any more sprees of any kind, particularly the landlord of her new apartment, who asked her for a $10 million security deposit. (And you thought two months' rent was bad.)Perhaps soon Girl World will finally be at peace. strong>Related: Follow Tess on Twitter.Photo Credit: OWN"	Entertainment
168	IN A shock to no one, Lindsay Lohan’s self-titled reality show on Oprah Winfrey’s network has depicted her as a spoiled prima-donna.I’m not Oprah ... Lindsay Lohan, right, with Oprah Winfrey.Source:SuppliedIN A shock to no one, Lindsay Lohan’s self-titled reality show on Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network has depicted her as a spoiled prima-donna (Is anyone remotely surprised?).During its first episode, Lohan is shown storming off the set of a lingerie shoot, ranting at her real estate agent, and forcing her personal assistant to get her a new hotel room after leaving her original one in a complete mess.“My intention is to just be me,” Lohan told Winfrey.Being “me” for Lohan means ranting, raving and crying if things don’t go her way.Case in point: upon hearing the real estate agent had put a US$10 million ($11 million) liability on the lease (can you blame them?) for her New York apartment, Lohan goes ballistic.“They can’t just add that to the lease! How the hell can anyone have that? I’m not Oprah. I can’t get that!”She then sends her poor personal assistant to clean out her hotel room (where she’d been living for 36 days).“I was the lucky guy that got to switch everything over. This woman’s got s*** you couldn’t believe,” said the hapless assistant.While her personal assistant cleaned up after her, Lohan told the cameras — with a straight face — she remembered “being in this bubble where everything was done for me. Now I’m figuring everything out for myself.”A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

172	"The Oprah Winfrey-produced series reveals a tumultuous world in which Lohan is clearly struggling – but for now, at least, its intentions appear to be good
Anne T Donahue

Mon 10 Mar 2014 16.41 GMT


Last modified on Tue 19 Dec 2017 21.39 GMT

Lindsay, the eight-part reality TV show which follows Lindsay Lohan in her attempts to rebuild her career, made its debut on the Oprah Winfrey Network on Sunday, and it reveals a world as tumultuous as might be expected.The series began filming in July 2013, as Lohan finished her sixth stint in rehab. It shows that the star is so hounded by the paparazzi that she can’t attend her AA meeting. She is striving for normalcy despite not being able to rent an apartment because of her reputation. But for now, at least, Lohan appears to be trying her best.Winfrey and OWN deserve some credit here. Lindsay is clearly a reality show, but it doesn’t romanticize tears and/or meltdowns: it focuses on Lindsay’s commitment to sobriety, and it uses recovery jargon to show just how all-encompassing her addiction treatment really is. The show sets Lohan up to succeed – it is not presented as an attempt to break her down. But despite the positive intentions surrounding Lohan’s move from Los Angeles to New York, is watching what is undoubtedly one of the most challenging times in her life supporting her comeback, or enabling her downfall?It’s easy to get caught up in the technicalities, or to frame them as part of the star’s now-infamous legacy. Four days out of rehab, Lohan is encouraged by Winfrey, who takes on a mentoring role, not to travel to Europe for the premiere of her Bret Easton Ellis-scripted movie The Canyons. Her sobriety coach repeats the point, which leads to her cancelling her appearance at the Venice film festival. She pulls out of a short lingerie film because the producers ask for dialogue, and explains that doing this would have “compromised her sanity and sobriety.” She gets angry because, when they find out who she is, she is charged a $10m insurance fee by a condo board, effectively eliminating her chances for an apartment.What Lindsay shows is that none of us can know what Lohan’s road to recovery looks, or should look, like, because her story is her own. Only she has Dina Lohan for a mother, only she has paparazzi bragging about how photos of her bought them expensive watches, and only she knows what this reality show is meant to do. Perhaps it will be part of an elaborate recovery process, or perhaps it is intended to prove to herself (and to potential employers) that she’s serious about working again.Lindsay has a potential to give Lohan the platform she needs to convey the difficulties both of addiction recovery, and of being a famous woman in a fame-obsessed world. It can give her a mouthpiece aside from the occasional one-on-one interview or TMZ sound bit. The early signs are cautiously promising.There are seven episodes left. If it becomes sensationalist; if it becomes a show that exploits Lohan more than media outlets already have, and romanticizes tragedy rather than strength, then it sets up both Lohan and viewers to fail: her, because she will be its victim; us, because we encouraged it."

173	"Lindsay Lohan wants to live ''with integrity''.The troubled actress - who has endured a string of legal problems in recent years and been to rehab six times - is determined to make a fresh start and wants to put her problems behind her.Speaking on her new docu-series 'Lindsay', which debuted on March 9, she said: ''Living with integrity and in control of my own self - that's the life I want now...''I'm excited to start this new chapter, so it's going to be good.''The 'Mean Girls' star was also seen telling program director Amy Rice that she now has ''inner peace''.She said: ''I'm in this really good place where I have this inner peace right now. All the distractions and chaos that go on outside just in daily life in general don't really affect me anymore.''The program also saw Lindsay search for an apartment in New York and left devastated when she found one she liked - but was told it required a $10 million insurance policy.She exclaimed: ''I can't do that. I'm not Oprah!''The 27-year-old actress stayed in a hotel while apartment hunting, and after a month in the luxury residence, she admitted she was finding the experience upsetting because she associated it with a ''crazy phase'' in her life.She said: ''It's the first time I'm really getting a place in New York and it's really chaotic.''I'm trying to figure out how to be sane and live, how to live out of a hotel, which I did when I was in a crazy phase in my life and that brings up a lot of memories and I hate it. ... And now I'm figuring out everything for myself with things being left up in the air constantly.''However, she insisted her housing struggle wouldn't send her out of control again.She added: ''I'm here. I'm showing up. I'm sober. And I'm dealing with it.''Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

174	"“What leaders really do: They don’t make plans; they don’t solve problems; they don’t even o…Everett CollectionEverett Collection“(I was) in this bubble where everything was done for me, and now, I’m figuring everything out for myself,” Lindsay Lohan, 27, tells Oprah Winfrey on the premiere of her OWN docu-series, simply titled, Lindsay.The eight-part series will follow the troubled actress, who finished her sixth rehab in July 2013, as she begins (again) her journey of self-improvement.Here are five candid quotes from the premiere of Lindsay.On what she wants out of her docu-series:“Just to be honest, and open. Just me. I’m trying to figure out how to be sane and live. (I was) in this bubble where everything was done for me, and now, I’m figuring everything out for myself.”On finally staying sober:“There’s nothing left in having a drink for me. There’s no situation that I haven’t been exposed to. So maybe trying the other way for me, which is living with integrity and living in control of my own self, that’s the life I want now.”On her past stint in jail:“The judge at the time that I had kept overruling me getting released even though they were overcrowded,” Lohan recalled of time spent in solitary confinement. “She kept making me stay there. What they were doing was punishing me instead of trying to help me.”On leaving Los Angeles for New York City:“I need a fresh start, a clean start. Life can be chaotic. But it’s about keeping myself calm in the middle of that, which is what I’m learning to do.”On missing an AA meeting:“We’ve been stuck in the [hotel] room all day, actually. Because there’s been 40 paparazzi outside. And I just really don’t feel like dealing with them today. They’re going to follow me to the meeting, and I don’t want them following me to an AA meeting. I just don’t want to deal with that, it’s not cool for anyone else there.” Filmmaker Amy Rice asks Lohan if she ever feels like a prisoner. “Yes,” Lindsay says with a laugh. “All the time.”View original at Parade.com

176	" (CNN) - After all the arrests, court appearances, trips to jail and rehab stays, Lindsay Lohan has turned to reality TV. 			On Sunday night, the 27-year-old made her latest comeback attempt in the OWN network's ""Lindsay,"" a docu-series that came across in its first episode as part ""E! True Hollywood Story"" and part ""Intervention,"" with a dash of ""Hoarders."" (Lohan, apparently, gets rid of nothing.)The premise is to follow Lohan around as she tries to piece her personal and professional life back together after six years of documented turmoil. And so last summer, less than a week after she completed a 90-day stay at a Malibu rehab facility -- a place that actually aired commercials during the show -- Lohan sat down with OWN's Oprah Winfrey for an interview and began filming.The trailer indicated that there would be no glossing over Lohan's flaws and missteps, as crew members and OWN staff openly commented on the ways Lohan was making production difficult. But in its first hour, viewers didn't get any of that. Instead, the show tracked the former child star as she messily packed up and moved from Los Angeles to New York, tried to find her own place, saw her younger sister walk in a fashion show and squeezed in an impromptu shopping trip. Her jewelery needed to be organized, and then she needed to change hotel rooms. Other than a brilliant ""Fetch"" T-shirt being flashed at one point, that was about as exciting as it got. Yet in the midst of all that minutiae, the core of ""Lindsay"" is the star's focus on sobriety. Lohan's numerous low points are tallied throughout the episode, and she's frequently accompanied by a sober coach. If nothing else, OWN's ""Lindsay"" wants to be the portrait of a young artist in recovery.Does it succeed? Maybe for fans of Lohan's (and she does still have them, as ""Lindsay"" proved by chatting up strangers on the street about the actress) or the compassionately voyeuristic. ""I know there r much more important things going on in the world,"" media personality Jacque Reid tweeted Sunday, ""but I am very curious to see if Lindsay can save herself.""In the beginning of the episode, Lohan at least seemed to be on her way there, saying during a one-on-one confessional that ""there's nothing left in having a drink for me.""""There's no situation that I haven't been exposed to,"" she went on. ""So maybe trying the other way for me, which is living with integrity and living in control of my own self, that's the life I want now.""But when faced with paparazzi, the stress of moving or a lingerie photo shoot that doesn't go as planned, the actress appeared on the brink of breaking down. For The Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon, those moments are what makes ""Lindsay"" worth watching. ""What 'Lindsay' succeeds most at is, for the first time in years, convincing us that Lindsay Lohan isn't a name in an Us Weekly headline or a joke in a late-night monologue or a character in a drama so wild it can't possibly be real life,"" Fallon writes. ""She's a human. She's a very fragile, volatile, slightly selfish human. But she's one who's working really hard to find peace in the eye of the very large, very tumultuous storm that surrounds her and is causing those dangerous traits.""As for everyone else, there's little draw outside of the opportunity to sharpen one's snarky barbs. ""A small part of me died when I found out this is more than a one episode show,"" tweeted The Hollywood Reporter's TV critic Tim Goodman, while Entertainment Weekly's Erin Strecker tried to rustle up a silver lining.

181	"Lindsay, the new Lindsay Lohan docuseries, premiered last night on the Oprah Winfrey Network and, as expected, completely OWNed the night. The riveting series proved to be one part Intervention, one part Hoarders—and all parts train wreck. Naturally, it was brought to you by Cliffside Malibu, one of Lindsay’s numerous rehab clinics. Whether this sponsorship will be a win for the center remains to be seen—the same can be said of Oprah’s sponsorship of America’s favorite troubled starlet. One thing’s for sure though, we’ll be watching!Here’s what you need to know:Lindsay’s intention is to be honest
Yeah, that’ll happen. Good thing Oprah’s intention is to call her out on her shit. Can’t wait for that “Cut the bullshit” byte OWN has been teasing.Lindsay is a Stage 3 hoarder
WIth a storage space bigger than your city block we all learned something last night: this girl’s got a lotta shit! She also likes to lay out all her jewelry on the floor and meticulously polish and examine it. Hmmmm, nope doesnt sound like drug induced behavior to us.Lindsay does not go to AA meetings
Despite half the show consisting of her getting in and out of Escalades while being chauffeured around the city Lindsay admits that she feels like a “prisoner” and decides she cannot handle leaving her hotel room when it comes time to, you know do that pesky chore of actually getting help for her addiction.Lindsay’s personal assistant used to work for Shaun White and Steven Tyler
And “addiction specialist” was clearly listed in the “other talents” section of his resume.“Fetch” T-Shirts exist
In related news, Dina Lohan has no idea what “Fetch” means, as evidenced when her daughter shows her one of said t-shirtsIt’s pronounced Low-HAN
She said it herself, kids! Whatever happened to “Lowen” as Lindsay preferred to be called in 2011? Rehab rebirth? Tomay-to/To-mahto. Whatever who cares.Lindsay airs Sundays at 10/9c on OWN"	Entertainment
182	Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network is bringing us Linsdsay Lohan as we’ve never seen her before in a “docu-series” directed by Amy Rice (a onetime writer for Aaron Sorkin’s The Newsroom and the director of By the People: The Election of Barack Obama) that traces the once-promising, still-full-of-star-potential actress’s life after rehab, as she moves back to New York City, reconnects with her family (mom Dina, dad Michael, modeling sister Ali), tries to get her career going again, and, as promised by the two-minute preview, is eventually told by Oprah herself that she should “cut the shit.”So what does Lindsay have to offer to the casual viewer? Perhaps a cocktail of rehab clichés and Oprah, or maybe will we travel to Lohan’s hometown of Merrick, Long Island — a town that’s also spawned notorious teens like Debbie Gibson and Amy Fisher. But here’s what we have learned from Lindsay so far.1. Lindsay appears to be ripping off the format of Intervention. Sober white subtitles on a field of black tell us that four days after getting out of rehab, Lohan is sitting down for an Oprah interview and then she’s moving back to New York to be near her family and to film a docu-series. We also get our first glance of Oprah, who tells Lohan, “I want you to win!” over a surge of emotional reality TV music. Lohan looks pretty and well rested, her hair back to red, her green eyes catlike, her voice still whiskey-soaked.2. We watch Lohan pack her boxes and boxes of stuff, going through clothes and the detritus of her life, which is intercut with man-on-the-street interviews about how John and Jane Doe feel regarding “Lindsay Lohan.” Some people think she’s a good actress, but the majority of people think she’s a flame-out train-wreck who can’t handle life, and these insights are layered over Lohan running around, getting her stuff together to move. Which is just patently unfair: who is living their best life in the middle of a cross-country move?3. It is hard to find an apartment: we join Lohan as she goes apartment hunting in Soho. Accompanied by NYC gal-about-town Chrissie Miller (daughter of Susan “Astrology Zone” Miller and former designer of fashion line Sophomore), Lohan is in a red ruffled dress that flies up in a Marilyn Monroe-like fashion over the city grates, and noticing this, the actress realizes that she has to change her outfit. Just like you, average viewer, she has trouble finding a place in New York and the hunt sucks; then again, she’s also rich enough to look for a place in Soho with a co-op board, so, you know, she’s doing alright.4. Lohan is basically Eloise: during what she described as “a crazy time in her life,” Lohan lived at the Chateau Marmot, the Los Angeles hotel that’s the center of many Hollywood myths, legends, and true stories. As Lohan hunts for an apartment in New York, she is staying at… I think it’s the Tribeca Grand, perhaps? Or maybe the Soho Grand. In this case, she is not as happy with the hotel life. “When I lived in hotels in the past, I was at this point where it was okay that I was not settled and I could live with that… It’s not as easy living in a hotel now.”5. Lohan is an addict, and she is accompanied by her sober coach, Michael Cormier. He is a gentle man with tattoos and observes, acutely, that someone who’s not an addict will receive a message in your brain that an activity is enough, that you’re satisfied. An addict won’t. He also, at one point, describes their day to day as “chaotic,” echoing the title of Britney Spears’ reality show.6. Lohan is also accompanied by her personal assistant, a man in a three-piece suit named Matt Harrell. Harrell reels off a series of people who he’s worked for in the past: Sean Astin, Prince, Shaun White, and Steven Tyler, so he’s probably okay with the ravages of plastic surgery and excessive amounts of scarves.7. Lohan travels to Merrick, Long Island, to reunite with her mother, Dina. In a Stars, They’re Just Like Us! moment, it turns out that Dina is letting Lohan store her stuff at her house. Lohan finds a cool red shirt (official Mean Girls merch?) that says “fetch” and reads aloud from her 2010 journal, written during her stay at Betty Ford. There’s a dog named Brooklyn there, and we get a peek at Lohan’s youngest brother, Cody. “It’ll be nice when that day comes where there’s no more talking and there’s only positive things being said,” Lohan notes.8. Lohan is trailed by the paparazzi. In what seems to be a plot point in this series, the paps are predatory bike messenger types waiting for her to leave the hotel so they can get a photo — a job that may be, in some ways, similar to blogging about this exploitative, weirdly Oprah-approved show. But Lohan ends up stuck in her hotel room, counting what’s left of her jewelry (most of it got robbed by Alexis Neiers and “the bling ring,” the second other reality show reference), and she can’t go to an AA meeting because of the paps.9. “Do you ever feel like a prisoner?” “Yes, all the time,” Lohan replies. Continuing the theme, a shot of Paul Schrader at The Canyons press conference in Venice (an event that Lohan was invited to attend and turned down in order to commit herself to sobriety) has the director describing himself as “a hostage of my own choosing to a very talented but unpredictable actress.”10. Lohan loves her sister. One thing about Lindsay: it doesn’t feel that staged for “reality,” save any moments with Dina. Lohan is at her happiest watching little sister Ali walking in a show at fashion week. The interaction’s genuine. It’s much better than watching Lohan dealing with a lingerie shoot where she would be “the intellect [who] gets absorbed into the world of beauty and lingerie” or watching her haggle with her broker, although the latter yielded the question, “How could anyone get [a renter’s liability policy]? I’m not Oprah!” Lohan ends the episode with “I’m showing up, I’m sober, and I’m dealing with it.”This season on Lindsay: Lohan looks sad at a meal with her father, Lohan yells at some people, Lohan looks sad dressed up in a Carrie costume, Oprah tells her that “the vultures are waiting to pick your bones.” Carcosa is New York, I think.@2016 Flavorpill Media.

183	"“I’m not Oprah,” Lindsay Lohan yelled into a cell phone in the first episode of her new show on OWN.This article is from the archive of our partner .“I’m not Oprah,” Lindsay Lohan yelled into a cell phone in the first episode of her new show on OWN. From the trailer that came out last week, it seemed like the show wanted nothing more than to highlight the difference between those two: Oprah is the good influence on Lindsay, who is a bad influence on herself.The first episode of the series didn’t show the real conflict between the woman responsible for the docu-series and its subject—that’s being saved for later episodes, we guess—instead the episode was about Lindsay’s big move to New York City after her latest stint in rehab. So we got scenes of Lindsay packing up her stuff at an L.A. storage facility; Lindsay driving around looking at apartments, stopping at her friend's store for a change of clothes; Lindsay dropping her stuff, which includes a Mean Girls “fetch” t-shirt, off at her mom’s house. We know who the villains are here: the paparazzi, the Los Angeles lifestyle, Lindsay's own persistent demons. In the beginning of the episode, everything was mostly happy-go-lucky. Lindsay seemed intent on recovering, and her personal assistant explained how much he believed in her. It was only at the end that we began to see the whole operation unravel. Lindsay couldn’t make it to an AA meeting because of the paparazzi; Lindsay dropped out of a shoot involving lingerie models; Lindsay still hadn't found an apartment. The show couldn't help but veer from mundane to trashy-tragic as Lindsay pouted and tears swelled in her eyes.That “I’m not Oprah” line stuck out, though, because something about it felt so planned, so performative, even though Lohan was in a heated argument with a real estate broker. No, she’s not Oprah, but she is on a show on Oprah’s network. Of course the line would make the final cut. This uneasy sense that Lindsay—like the best reality stars before her—is acting for the cameras popped up elsewhere too. When Lindsay was at Dina Lohan’s house unpacking, she read aloud a passage from her journal from one of her stints in the Betty Ford Clinic. She was opening up and sharing, but a viewer couldn't help but feel like a voyeur. When the trailer for the rest of the season aired near the end of the program, it was clear the direction in which this show is headed. Lindsay—performing, or perhaps losing her ability to perform—will spiral downward. Oprah will hopefully prop her back up. That's a good arc for a TV show, but then you realize you're dealing with someone's fragile life.  This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.
    From the Mayan ballgame Pitz to ancient Greece’s bull-leaping, here’s a tour of the history of athletic games.
The fumbling of domestic-violence accusations against Rob Porter is a story about the administration’s inability to tell the truth, not its disorganization.The White House’s response to allegations of domestic violence against former Staff Secretary Rob Porter has so stunned reporters that the whole episode has become an exemplar of the total disorganization of the Trump administration.“Abuse Case Exposes Fissures in a White House in Turmoil,” The New York Times intones. Axios’s Jonathan Swan writes, “This is crazy. Even in a White House that’s famous for chaos, I’ve never seen anything like this.” Politico’s Playbook simply announced, “CHAOS at 1600 Pennsylvania.”This is peculiar, not only because it is difficult to imagine what would rise to the level of notable chaos relative to the standards of this White House. It’s strange because the focus on disorder has overshadowed the more salient feature of the moment: Insofar as the administration is engulfed in chaos, it is a result of its inability to tell the truth. The Trump team doesn’t have a chaos problem so much as it has a dishonesty problem. Of course this is not new, either—in fact, the serial dissembling of the White House has become so banal that it goes almost unremarked in this case—yet it is on particularly dramatic display here.In the mid-1930s, the Federal Writers’ Project interviewed thousands of former slaves, some of whom claimed the president came to their plantations disguised as a beggar or a peddler, telling them they’d soon be free.Shortly before the election of 1860, a man came upon a plantation near Marlin, Texas, some 20 miles southeast of Waco. Though nobody knew who he was, the plantation owner took him in as a guest. The stranger paid close attention to how the enslaved people working on the plantation were treated—how they subsisted on a weekly ration of “four pounds of meat and a peck of meal,” how they were whipped and sometimes sold, resulting in the tearing apart of families. Eventually, the stranger said goodbye and went on his way, but a little while later he wrote a letter to the plantation owner, informing him he would soon have to free his slaves—“that everybody was going to have to, that the North was going to see to it.” The stranger told the owner to go into the room where he’d slept, and see where he’d carved his name into the headrest. And when the slaveholder went and looked, he saw the name: “A. Lincoln.”Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald rose to the occasion with their paintings of the former president and first lady, while—importantly—continuing their radical projects in black portraiture.Jasmine, African blue lilies, and Chicago’s favorite flower, chrysanthemum, flourish in the botanical backdrop of President Barack Obama’s official portrait. The 44th president appears seated in an ornate chair, with leafy vines threatening to climb up his pant leg.In her official portrait, First Lady Michelle Obama appears seated, too, in a flowing dress designed by Milly. Between her gown, with its touches of geometric patterning, and the sky-blue paint that frames her figure, the painting features a lot of hard-edged abstraction.On Monday, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled the Obamas’ official portraits. President Obama’s portrait, by the Los Angeles–born and New York–based artist Kehinde Wiley, will join the museum’s hall of American presidents, where it will permanently disrupt the march of white presidential paintings. The portrait of Michelle Obama, the work of Baltimore’s Amy Sherald, will be on view with recent acquisitions through November 2018.From Donald Trump to recent op-eds, the male perspective remains—stubbornly, perniciously—the default point of view.The tweet, as so often happens, was at once shocking and deeply predictable.Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused—life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?That was President Trump, on Saturday, ostensibly reacting to the fact that, this week, allegations of domestic abuse led to the resignations of two high-level staffers at the White House. He was also, obliquely, weighing in on #MeToo. The president’s 48-word assessment of the reckoning so many Americans are painfully but productively engaged in made for rich (but thoroughly unsurprising) irony: Trump, of course, has been accused of sexual impropriety by 19 women—and has also been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault, and has also boasted, on national television, about advising friends to “be rougher” toward their wives, and has also been elected president of the United States. His tweet is revealing both in spite and because of those facts: “Peoples[sic],” in the plural; allegation, in the singular. The peoples meaning the “men’s”; the allegation—though in its context, the diminishing adjective is redundant—being a “mere” one.The surprise release of The Cloverfield Paradox, along with acquisitions of other schlocky genre movies, suggests the company is leaning in to its “direct-to-video” approach.Just a year ago, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Netflix was a big player. The streaming company was a little more than a year into releasing its own original movies for its subscribers, and it was looking for prestige hits to gain a foothold as a distributor Hollywood could take seriously. It acquired one of the best-reviewed films of the festival, Mudbound, for $12.5 million, and the Grand Jury Prize winner I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, among others. In terms of prestige, Netflix was lagging behind its competitor Amazon, which had nabbed a Best Picture nomination for its major Sundance acquisition of 2016, Manchester by the Sea. Maybe Netflix’s new slate of indie favorites would turn things around.Images of Carnival season 2018, already underway, with celebrations in Brazil, Portugal, Hungary, Bolivia, Haiti, Spain, Italy, and more.Carnival season 2018 is underway across Europe and the Americas.

To deem yourself “smart” is to make the NIMBYites and market-force people look stupid.Smart-city devotees all over this world will agree that London is particularly smart. Why? London is a huge, ungainly beast whose cartwheeling urban life is in cranky, irrational disarray. London is a god-awful urban mess, but London does have some of the best international smart-city conferences.London also has a large urban-management bureaucracy who emit the proper smart-city buzzwords and have even invented some themselves.  The language of Smart City is always Global Business English, no matter what town you're in.The president’s budget proposal has some troubling news for the space agency’s next big astronomy mission.The Trump administration has released its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 and put dozens of federal programs on the chopping block, including a brand-new NASA space telescope that scientists say would provide the biggest picture of the universe yet, with the same sparkling clarity as the Hubble Space Telescope.The proposal, released Monday, recommends eliminating the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), citing “higher priorities” at NASA and the cost of the new telescope.“Given competing priorities at NASA, and budget constraints, developing another large space telescope immediately after completing the $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope is not a priority for the administration,” the proposal states. “The budget proposes to terminate WFIRST and redirect existing funds to other priorities of the science community, including completed astrophysics missions and research.”Republican lawmakers are increasingly showing disdain for decisions made by the judicial branch—and by extension the rule of law.An old legal anecdote—attributed to such legal notables as Mae West and the Earl of Birkenhead—depicts a frustrated judge asking an obstreperous lawyer, “Are you displaying contempt of court?”“No, your honor,” the advocate responds. “I am trying to conceal it.”I sometimes think simple politeness—a willingness to conceal contempt for other parties, judges, and even law itself—is all that differentiates true lawyers from thugs in contrast-collar shirts. But like other areas of public etiquette, this habitual courtesy is showing strain in the era of Donald Trump.Trump likes to denounce and threaten courts that thwart his will. But the political threat to courts did not begin with Trump and will not end when he is gone. It is part of a civic rot that is eating at the vitals of our democracy, and it is getting worse.Americans would be less alienated from one another and solve problems more easily if they recognized one little-noticed distinction in policy debates.We sometimes think of political issues in binary terms. Is someone pro-life or pro-choice? But most individuals hold views that are more complicated than a binary can capture.An alternative is to describe a given position on a spectrum. On abortion, an outright ban sits at one extreme; at the other is the elimination of all restrictions on the procedure. In between are a staggering array of coherently distinguishable positions.Politicians seeking to win votes express their stances either in terms of a binary or as a spot on a spectrum, depending on where they see the greatest advantage. Though their beliefs don’t change, how they frame them makes a political difference.* * *There’s a different set of frames, though, that are as relevant as binaries and spectrums, though they are less familiar and less discussed: equilibriums and limits.In a StoryCorps animation, Patrick Haggerty remembers the remarkable advice he got from his dairy farmer dad.It’s an incredible story.

184	Four days after Lindsay Lohan left rehab last summer (her sixth stay in six years), she started shooting a reality show for the Oprah Winfrey Network; the eight-episode series, “Lindsay,” premiered Sunday night. Who thought this was a good idea?Lots of people, apparently. Oprah’s network certainly needs the viewers and Lohan needs people to think her life isn’t a total trainwreck anymore. Presumably, the goal is to mutually help each other, but is it really smart to put an addict in front of a camera at all times?Yeah, we know the answer, too. As a result, watching the “Lindsay” debut just felt wrong. Lohan is clearly still very troubled, and even though every celebrity docu-series is somewhat voyeuristic, this one was flat out sad and absolutely no fun. Most of the premiere involved Lohan, accompanied by a sober coach and personal assistant, talking to the cameras about this new transitional phase in her life and how much she’s changed; Lohan getting in and out of giant chauffeured SUVs as she searches for a new apartment in New York; and Lohan bailing on various scheduled commitments.If you couldn’t stomach it, here are the five most upsetting moments in the hour-long premiere.1) The flashbacks to Lohan’s glory days.For the last several years, most photos of Lohan show the actress looking miserable, usually on her way to court or after she’s been caught in some sort of trouble. That’s why it’s heartbreaking to flash back to Lohan’s earlier days. In the beginning of the episode there’s a short clip of adorable 12-year-old Lohan on the red carpet for the premiere of “The Parent Trap” remake, her first big movie, beaming with happiness as she answers questions about playing twins.Then we see Lohan grinning for the cameras at the “Freaky Friday” debut in 2003 (box office gross: $160 million) and later, posing for photos for her star turn in “Mean Girls” in 2004. Obviously, it all went downhill from there: DUI convictions, arrests, probation, violation of probation, theft charges, etc. Being reminded of her once-promising future is just sad.2) Lohan family timeThe main storyline of the premiere is that Lohan is moving from Los Angeles to New York to make a fresh start and live closer to her family. After shipping a massive amount of boxes to her mother’s house on Long Island, Lohan pays a visit to go through some of the things, including a journal from her time at the Betty Ford rehab clinic. She reads some passages out loud, including one about being upset that her mother, Dina, was barred from visiting. Having been bombarded with headlines about the highly dysfunctional Lohan family relationships, it’s all way too invasive.The saddest moment? Seeing Lohan hug her younger brother and tell her family she loves them in a feel-good moment that feels way too forced — underscored by the microphone pack clipped on the back of Lohan’s dress, a depressing visual reminder that they’re all playing for the cameras.3) Lohan promising she’s changed her unreliable ways, then bailing on everythingThough Lohan swears she’s become a different person post-rehab, she bails at least three different times on various planned commitments through the course of the episode, making life difficult for others. Case in point: Lohan decides she’s too stressed out to fly to the Venice Film Festival to promote her latest film, “The Canyons,” (the subject of that fascinating “Here is What Happens When You Cast Lindsay Lohan in Your Movie” NYT article) and cancels her trip. The director, Paul Schrader, is blunt with the crowd in Venice. “Today I am a free man,” he says dramatically. For the last 16 months, “I have been a hostage of my own choosing by a very talented but unpredictable actress, and she was supposed to be here today. She said she would be, but she’s not.”Ouch. Later, Lohan has signed on to appear in a “short film” to promote a lingerie brand (side note: what?) because she’s friends with the producers. Only once she finds out they want her to be involved in actual scenes with dialogue rather than a photoshoot, she angrily decides to drop out. The reason? They lied to her about her role, and she doesn’t trust liars. She acknowledges that she only agreed just so she could be on a set again — but that environment wasn’t good for her “sobriety or sanity.”4) The people who have to deal with herMatt, Lohan’s beleaguered personal assistant, has to keep up with her demands, erratic behavior, and general bad mood when she’s been living in a hotel for a month because she can’t find an apartment in New York. (By the way, Matt tells the camera that before Lindsay, he worked as an assistant to Sean Astin, Prince, Shaun White and Steven Tyler. Someone get this man his own show!) Lohan also chews out the real estate broker, Cash, for not finding her an apartment — especially when one building insists she have a $10 million rental insurance policy, because obviously that’s Cash’s fault. Her sober coach, Michael, is the most patient, even when Lohan decides she doesn’t want to go to an AA meeting because of the dozens of paparazzi staked outside her hotel.5) Oprah’s role in all of thisYou know what, Oprah? We appreciate all you’ve done for a lot of other people, but it’s hard to have respect for you after seeing this show.We see Oprah sitting down with Lohan at the beginning of the episode, grilling her on what she wants out of the experience. “Just to be honest and open and you know,  just to be me,” Lohan says. Oprah replies that’s good, and just get ready, because she’s ready to call Lohan out on any bad behavior or lies throughout production. Lohan eagerly nods, and it’s sad because she so clearly wants approval from one stable adult in her life. Oprah is beyond condescending about it. “I’ll let you change into your pretty little dress,” Oprah says flippantly after their pre-interview chat, walking out of the room so Lohan can get ready for the day.Ugh. Come on Oprah, you need Lohan for the ratings, just like she needs you — don’t act like you’re doing her some big favor by allowing her to grace the presence of your network.	Entertainment
185	"It seems that Lindsay, the Lindsay Lohan reality show produced by Oprah Winfrey, is the guerrilla hit of my TV season. After giving the obligatory eyebrow-raise at the original announcement, I didn't pay attention to it until the trailer dropped on Friday—and, with its true docu-style and arresting sound bites, made me take notice.The show premiered last night, and (as is befitting of O) it's basically a master class in reality television. Lindsay is shot like a more sophisticated True Life—we get background when we need it, stats when they're powerful, and tons of private moments.Of course, none of that matters if you don't have the perfect subject—and as it turns out, Lohan is. She's seen every nook and cranny of the fame game, so she's not affected by the cameras. She's had her every mortifying moment dragged into the public eye, so she's completely unafraid of honesty. She's wary, funny, occasionally bitchy—basically, she reminds me a lot of the rest of us, especially in the sense that she gets up every day seemingly believing that it'll be a happy one. Sometimes her good mood is waylaid by the apartment process (been there) or the indefatigable paparazzi (that one, not so much—but I don't envy her), but it's the way she starts each day that's so relatable. (And if we're trying to gauge her overall positivity: Lohan spends much of episode one calmly editing a storage-unit haul that would have reduced me to a sobbing, chocolate-smeared, arson-considering mess.)But the real magic of this show is in its timing. Like most reality subjects, Lohan indicates at the top of the show that she'd like to help people in some way by exposing her journey. Unlike most reality subjects, she's not bulls—ting. The whole ""if I can even make one person _____"" trope has been worn out by housewives and D-listers who, deep down, just want to be on TV.Lohan's position is different. A teaser for the season ahead hinted at the sort of troubles we've come to think of as characteristic for her—flaking on shoots, etc.—but the actress's power, in this series, doesn't hinge on her behavior record or even her intentions. The fact is: She's in a fragile place, as a young woman and as an addict, having seen a hell of a lot and needing to decide how to move on. How do you build a stable future when your past was all high glitter and major stumbles? How do you get excited about what's ahead when your former definition of excitement—both the substances and the circumstances that led to them—is now off-limits, by your own choice?That's the question this series seems to be setting out to answer—and it's one addicts and nonaddicts alike can empathize with. The great thing about having Lohan in the question is we really care what happens to her. Not all of us (as I'm sure someone's gonna tell me in the comments!)—but millions of us, in a way that can't quite be explained, except to say that maybe some people are born to be rooted for. Lohan is one of those people. If she's been dealt a mixed hand in life, that is her ace. Lindsay gives us a chance to watch as she plays her next card—and it knows we all want her to nail it.©2018 Condé Nast.

190	"ShareTweetShareShareTweetShareLast night Lindsay Lohan got another chance to make a comeback. And unlike her Canyons comeback, this won't be considered softcore porn. Lindsay, a docu-series on OWN, follows her post-rehab life as she grapples with her addiction to substances, attention and putting inflatable pool rafts in her lips. Just in case you went into a coma in 2003 and are aghast that this adorable freckled actress could harm a fly, let me catch you up. After a spate of crimes involving drugs, DUIs, theft and constantly wearing tights as pants, Lindsay succesfully (and suprisingly) completed her 6th rehab stint this summer. Since leaving rehab, Lindsay’s been laying low—which for most of us involves ordering Chinese, putting on fuzzy socks, and watching every episode of House of Cards. But for Lindsay it just means not getting arrested. Hence, this show marks the first time in a while that Lindsay has registered on the Richter scale of celebrity relevance. I had been missing her face, so at first I was happy to see her. But as the show went on, watching her fall into her same destructive patterns became overbearingly grim.The show begins optimistically enough with a fresh-out-of-rehab Lindsay returning to New York for a new start. She is clear-minded, measured and sounding more or less like a 60-year-old Vegas cocktail server with laryngitis. I know even 12-year-old Parent Trap Lindsay had a raspy voice, but these days, it seriously sounds like her words are being translated into frog. Anyway, what follows is an attempt at redemption with Oprah so blatantly cast as the savior that they probably would have had her turn water to wine were it not for Lindsay’s pesky drinking problem. Sadly, if Oprah’s intent truly is to keep Lindsay sober, it really is going take Jesus’ miracle skills to do it, and I think even he’d be like “whoa, gotta call my Dad for back-up on this one.”Odds are high that Lindsay will fail. We know this because—spoiler alert—she was recently seen wobbling out of a club like you’d walk on a ship during a white squall. So witnessing her slowly lose the battle of self-control isn’t even entertaining; it’s just sad. If I wanted to witness addiction in action, I’d just install a video camera above my fridge and watch 300 hours of footage of myself globbing cheese onto every conceivable cracker product, my fingers, and uh…other cheeses. At least it wouldn’t feel so wrong to watch. But if you want to simultaneously feel bad for her and feel really good about your own life choices, here are some disturbing insights from last night’s show.1. Lindsay is more incapable of doing things for herself than you at age 8Lindsay has a crew of submissive minions who heed her commands and never question her logic. Including when she decides to go shopping in the middle of apartment-hunting and makes her time-crunched realtor wait in the car while she tries on jaunty hats. Her lack of self-sufficiency is so cloaked in self-delusion that at one point she actually says the words, “I was living in a bubble where everything was done for me. Now I’m figuring it out for myself.” Keep in mind that this is said at the very moment her assistant is switching all of her belongings from one hotel room into another room just because Lindsay “couldn't handle [the first] room anymore.” Lindsay is totally helpless, but I’m pretty sure 99% of celebrities have forgotten how to tie their shoes and have no idea what a grocery cart is for (“is that a cage for food?”), so I’ll give her a slight break on this one.2. She hoards material items and looks at them with the glint of GollumI would say that 90% of this show consists of Lindsay feverishly riffling through her jewelry and clothes, which dot every single surface of her hotel room. I don’t even know how people walk around in that room; it looks like the hall closet of my mom’s house that contains every ski jacket, umbrella, and wrapping paper product we’ve had (and keeping buying) since 1992. Lindsay seems to stockpile everything she encounters, so I suggest she watch a few episodes of Hoarders. After she's seen long-dead cats be discovered between couch cushions, I doubt she'll feel as strongly about keeping that towel from the set of Just My Luck.3. Her mom should never have been allowed to rear a living thing, including plantsWhen Lindsay goes home to see her mother for the first time in months, Dina Lohan is concerned and asks for a moment of privacy away from the prying eyes of the cameras to make sure Lindsay is OK. Just kidding. Dina gives Lindsay a cursory half-hug with no sincerity and looks directly into the camera with an eye-bulging lust for attention. It was as if in that moment, her body was a portal for the souls of all the world’s stage moms, and that’s where they go to ask what low-cut dress to put their 12-year-old daughter in. Poor Linds never had a chance.4. Everyone around her lies to her faceWe always hear about the obsequious “yes men” who erect sound-proof walls of delusion around celebrities to shield them from the truth. Here's your chance to see that happen when Lindsay’s underling starts talking about how amazing her new movie The Canyons is (conveniently leaving out that it makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane). What Lindsay needs is that brutally honest mirror from Snow White, so when she’s like ‘Mirror, mirror on the wall, aren’t I totally healthy, beautiful, and talented?” it’ll be like, “Girl, you trippin. It ain’t 2003 and Tina Fey is hella disappointed in you. Go do a detox in India and get back to me.”5. No one will ever again believe a word she says unless they've time-traveled from the pastEveryone knows Lindsay Lohan, and in every language that name translates to liar. There's even a segment in the show where the filmmakers ask random people on the street to share their sentiments about Lindsay, and they all basically roll their eyes so hard that they give themselves motion sickness. At this point, the only person who would trust Lindsay would be a defrosted caveman a la Encino Man who just wants to make fire and paint woolly mammoths. I tend to believe every movie I see, so I choose to think this could be Lindsay's future husband.That's my take on this naked ratings ploy. Is it mindless reality TV that’ll make you forget that stupid thing you said in a meeting earlier? Not really. It’s the tale of someone with real problems whose (very fragile) life is at stake, and it’s hard to derive harmless schadenfreude from that. My recommendation to Lindsay would be: turn off the cameras,  and change your name so your mom can’t find you. We'll miss you, but we'll know it's for the best.(Photo: Heavy) ShareTweetShare©2017 Defy Media, LLC, All rights reserved.

            Literally, figuratively.
          The word's saddest episode of Storage Wars aired last night on OWN, and it took the form of Lindsay Lohan's first Oprah-supported venture into reality TV. The premiere centered around Lindsay moving to New York to be closer to her family after leaving rehab, and because the city is less paparazzi-infested. In preparation for the relocation, we saw the falling starlet organizing the caverns of her storage unit while a crew of onlookers (Sober Coach! Assistant! Dina Lohan!) attempted to organize the emotional baggage she's been carrying around for the past 25 years. And that was the high point: Considering how drama appears to follow Lohan, it's weird that last night's premiere was so ... boring. Maybe because it's hard to sympathize with a rich person trying to get an apartment in NYC — even if her excuses for the slow move (it's not easy to get a co-op board to approve a press magnet) were relatively valid! Or maybe because the tantalizing clip OWN released of Oprah yelling at Lohan doesn't happen until at least episode three? But on reality TV, isn't all baggage the same — even if it comes in the literal form of a mountain of boxes full with dated and wrinkled couture dresses? Watch LiLo sort through her crap, literally, in a scene layered with metaphor, and pretty much a sign of what you can expect from the seven upcoming episodes of the docuseries.In Conversation: Quincy JonesAmerica Is Great, But Olympic Skater Adam Rippon Just Wants to Make Reese Witherspoon ProudBarack and Michelle Obama’s Official Portraits Are RevealedWhat’s New on Netflix: February 2018Every Episode of Black Mirror, Ranked From Worst to BestSee what’s new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBOHomeland Season-Premiere Recap: Welcome to the ResistanceThe Obamas’ Official Portraits Rise to the OccasionAdam Rippon Has Nothing to Say to Mike Pence, Which Is a Shame, Because Everything He Says Is GoldKim Cattrall Does Not Want ‘Hypocrite’ Sarah Jessica Parker’s Condolences at This TimeWhat Made Mirai Nagasu’s Triple Axel So IncredibleWhy rise to the No. 1 spot when you can just buy it?This show could be one of the all-time Star Trek greats.Zac Efron, please take a shower.A former neighbor had accused the singer of groping her at his home in 2016.They join stars Andrew Rannells and Don Cheadle.And it shows no signs of slowing down.Starting March 31.Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald join the canon.Whether for inspiration, fitspiration, or thirst.“You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV.”… some of these five come-from-behind conditions are met.Director Tom Tykwer on the dance clubs, flapper girls, and political violence in his new Netflix show.Parents have complained about a scene where Peter Rabbit uses a slingshot to force-feed a blackberry to a farmer who is allergic to the fruit.Is Reileen the true mastermind of Altered Carbon?Painted by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald.Everyone from Kristi Yamaguchi to Reese Witherspoon reacted. “Reese has been a wonderful support system in teaching me the ways of modernity,” Portman said.“I think we need to get those people who think that I was ripped off on a judging panel immediately.”“We are disappointed that anyone would make such a wrongful comment about either Marlon Brando or Richard Pryor.”The actor was accused of sexual misconduct by five women following his Golden Globes win.© 2018, New York Media LLC.

	Lindsay Lohan started her new Oprah Winfrey Network reality show Sunday night behaving like a model prisoner.
	Yet by the end of the first hour, she looked like she was starting to think about sticking a shiv into someone.
	""Lindsay,"" an eight-week series on OWN, was part of the deal whereby Oprah got the first interview after Lohan finished up her sixth rehab stint last July 30.
	It's a good deal for Oprah, because Lohan brings attention to a network that can still use it.
	As a reality TV show, though, ""Lindsay"" turned out to be surprisingly routine. Perhaps because Lohan's behavior has been so reckless in the past, it's unlikely she could do anything in front of Oprah's cameras that would slam into or clear the bar she has set in the past.
	Reality TV fans and celebrity watchers have seen a lot worse than they saw Sunday night - though Lohan, for very good reasons, framed her behavior simply as a sign she has finally started to grow up.
	She was moving to New York for a fresh start, she said, and while she still felt like a prisoner ""all the time"" because of paparazzi and media attention, it would work because she had learned to separate and isolate herself from the ""craziness"" and ""insanity"" around her.
	She didn't directly acknowledge that her notoriety has been fed by her rehab stints, her DUI arrests, her public family throwdowns and her jail time. But one of the final scenes Sunday showed an exasperated Lohan reprimanding her real estate broker because she's required to get renter's liability insurance before she can move into her new apartment.
	""I can't get it,"" she tells him, ""because of who I am.""
	In keeping with the upbeat Oprah spirit, ""Lindsay"" is heavily sprinkled with the language of rehab and self-improvement, about ""making the right decisions"" and ""being in the right place.""
	But even through the first hour, Lohan's early optimism and buoyancy were clearly eroding.
	She agreed to do a cameo in a short lingerie film because she's friends with the producers.
	When they asked her to add a few lines of dialogue, she balked. Her voice rose, she started crying and she pulled out.
	Going through with it, she said afterwards, would have ""compromised my sanity and my sobriety.""
	It was, repeat, a short lingerie film.
	""Lindsay"" did give an indication how some of this obvious fragility developed and persists. She is followed by paparazzi everywhere, at one point cancelling a planned trip to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting because ""it wouldn't be fair to the others"" if she showed up with a trail of camera jocks.
	She feels like a prisoner ""all the time,"" she said, and despite her periodic insistence that she had learned to carry on anyhow, her frustration with the press seemed to rise in direct proportion to her other stress.
	She looked at 10 apartments over almost two months and when she finally got one she liked, she hit the ""renter's liability"" wall.
	To make herself feel better after that setback, she had her people move her to a different room in her hotel, just for a change of scenery.
	Viewers then got to hear Lohan talk about how ""I have to do everything myself,"" while several assistants back at the hotel frantically moved the equivalent of a small movie studio from her old room to her new one.
	She also sounded a little detached when she talked about how moving back to New York would get her closer to her family - the same family, presumably, that has co-starred in many of her headlines.
	""It's comforting to be around my family,"" she says. ""They're a huge part of my recovery and I wouldn't have it any other way.""
	Okay.
	Everyone around Lohan seemed to take the cue from Oprah and treat her as if the sixth time was the charm and she really has turned the rehab corner.
	That's the right way to play the game. Still, as Lohan's own tension level rose and she got a little more snappish, that was reflected in the people around her - including Oprah herself, who in a well-circulated tease to future episodes laments that Lohan behaved exactly the way people had warned Oprah she would.
	As a coincidence, the place where Lohan did her sixth rehab, Cliffside Malibu, was one of the advertisers on the premiere of ""Lindsay"" Sunday night.
	The ad starts with a somber warning that ""83% of rehab clients relapse within the first year.""
	Welcome to the intersection where art and commerce meet Lindsay Lohan's life.

197	"Discovery Communications, Inc.(NEW YORK) — The series premiere of Lindsay Lohan’s OWN docu-series, Lindsay, on Sunday night was filled with the kind of drama you’d expect from the actress, though nothing especially scandalous.Lindsay began with the Mean Girls star sitting down with Oprah Winfrey for an interview last August, just days after she was released from court-ordered rehab, stemming from a car crash case. But much of the one-hour episode focused on Lohan’s move from California to New York, in an attempt to wipe the slate clean.Lohan dropped off a lot of her stuff at her mom Dina’s Long Island home, but she didn’t crash there. Instead, she decided to live in a hotel until she could find an apartment, which proved to be more difficult than she anticipated.Amid all of this, Lohan was offered a chance to be flown to the Venice Film Festival to promote her film, The Canyons. The catch: she had to make an appearance in London for GQ. After consulting with her sober coach, she chose to nix the deal and skip the film festival, drawing the ire of her director, Paul Schrader. He claimed at a Venice press conference that he’d been held “hostage” by Lohan.Lohan missed working on a set, so she agreed to appear in a lingerie spot. However, she didn’t like the script, and she later had a heated exchange with the director that ended with her leaving in tears. She dropped out of the project.The episode ended with a preview of what’s ahead later in the season. There are more arguments ahead, including at least one with her father, Michael Lohan.Episode two of Lindsay will air next Sunday night on OWN.Copyright 2014 ABC News Radio© 2015 - 2018

198	Lindsay Lohan’s new documentary series “Lindsay” premiered on OWN on Sunday night, and while it showed television viewers some fairly obvious things – like the actress constantly being hounded by paparazzi, and her struggling to stay sober – there were some surprising moments.Here are four things that caught our attention:She Has A Warehouse Of Stuff!: When Lindsay made the decision to move from Los Angeles to New York, it required a trip to her storage space, which was, to put it mildly, huge – like near-Costco huge. There appeared to be an entire warehouse filled with things she’s collected over the last decade, stuffed into crates, and crates, and still more crates. Among some of the things viewers got to see – lots of jewelry, piles of clothing (including one sparkly black dress still on a mannequin) and some dead flowers in their plastic wrapping.PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan Over The Years Lindsay’s Personal Assistant Worked For A Hobbit & A Prince: Matt Harrell was introduced as Lindsay’s personal assistant and he rattled off the names of celebs he worked with. Surprisingly enough, his list included Sean Astin (from “Lord of the Rings”), music superstar Prince, Olympic snowboarder Shaun White (although he noted it was only a brief stint), and the last celeb he worked with before Lindsay? Steven Tyler.She Outfit Changes While Apartment Shopping: Lindsay likes her frilly dresses, but when one of them was whipped up by the wind during apartment hunting, the actress decided to make a detour. Popping into a friend’s shop, Lindsay went from a flowing spaghetti strap mini dress to the more sensible-for-windy-weather shorts and a tank.PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan: The Early YearsFetch! Lives: Lindsay starred as Cady Heron in 2004’s “Mean Girls,” and she still has souvenirs inspired by the movie – Fetch T-shirts. While going through the crates she shipped to her mom’s house, Lindsay revealed she still has a host of red tees with the the slogan on them. That really is fetch!-- Jolie LashNBCUniversal, Inc.

199	"[There was a video here]Lindsay Lohan was chainsmoking and braless for much of last night's premeire of her OWN reality show, LindsayLindsay Lohan&apos;s OWN ""docu-series"" Lindsay doesn&apos;t start airing until Sunday,…It wasn't until more than halfway through when the ""real"" ""drama"" kicked in—Lindsay cried while preparing for a lingerie promo she'd appeared to be in because she felt that her role in it had changed with her increased availability. Or something. Basically, Lindsay felt like she was getting jerked around and so she chewed out the director. And then she did the same to a real estate agent whom she felt ""lackadaisical"" and lacking in urgency when it came to securing her a permanent residence.And then she yelled at people a few more times in the trailer for the rest of the season of her show.Time will tell if Lindsay is quality, quality trash, or neither, but the first episode seemed to present an uncommonly complicated portrayal of its star. If it weren't completely candid, it was brilliantly constructed to appear so. Lindsay's capacity for sympathy ranges from scene to scene. She's sometimes bratty, but that's often when she feels like people are taking advantage of her (and as a former child star whose parents have fucked her over repeatedly in the harsh light of public, you see why she'd be extra touchy about getting taken advantage of). But she also seems to demand so much of some people in her life that you wonder if she's not taking advantage of them, and if what she's fighting for is merely the upper hand. After she backed out of the lingerie shoot, Lindsay said it was ""like a filler thing"" and that, ""I was just doing it to do it and I shouldn't have
done that, because I compromised myself and my sobriety and my sanity."" That's fair but also kind of disrespectful of one of the few jobs she had offered to her at the time of shooting.""I know that this is my last shot at doing what I love to do,"" she said at the beginning of the show, matter-of-factly aware that reality TV is where some careers go to die. That's a brutal self-evaluation.Paparazzi play a big role in the show—they irritate, they complicate, they make Lindsay feel virtually immobile at times. Below, she explains how they're preventing her from attending an AA meeting. They might be some irony to derive from that, given her relationship to fame, if she weren't a former child star who had a lot of attention foisted on her and no tools for comprehending whether that's what she actually wanted at the time. Lindsay seems like she can be a jerk, and her self-sabotaging can be infuriating for anyone rooting for her, but this prisoner-in-her-own-life stuff struck me as just plain depressing.[There was a video here]"	Entertainment

203	"Dear Lindsay Lohan:Just caught the first hour of your new OWN reality show “Lindsay,” and honey, this show is so not a good idea.I understand that, after 90 days clean and sober at Cliffside Malibu, you felt the need to prove you are not an irretrievable mess; that, despite recent evidence to the contrary (""Liz and Dick,"" ""The Canyons""), you still have much to offer as a performer.And having Oprah Winfrey promise she will call you out must make you feel somewhat safe (who wants to disappoint Oprah?) and special. Which is one of the biggest reasons filming one’s recovery for display on national television is not standard practice among 12-step followers.In your path to sobriety, you aren't special; you're just another drunk with the same sort of issues as the guy sleeping in the doorway of whatever part of New York in which drunks are still allowed to sleep in doorways.It was difficult not to wonder if you had, perhaps, rushed into this whole thing. You were only out of rehab four days when filming began and frankly, your explanation for doing the show -- ""There's something to be said about my being so public"" -- is not the best one could have hoped for.Yes, Lindsay, there are many things to be said and most of them will not be nice. So why on earth would you put yourself in this position, especially at a time when you should just be going to meetings, reading the Big Book and finding a sponsor?Celebrity is an addiction too.As for Oprah, well, it was hard not to be a wee bit concerned when she suggested that you not take the trip you were planning to Europe. ""I'm wondering,"" she said, ""is that the best decision. ... There's something about Europe, being the playground for fun and pleasure.""So going to Europe, no, but moving from Los Angeles to New York, with a film crew and a famous director (Ann Rice) in tow, yes. Am I the only one who remembers when Kirstie Alley did a realty show so she could lose weight? Which didn't work?Still, it is difficult not to love a girl who sorts through her endless vault of storage boxes wearing short shorts and knee-high black boots. You looked fabulous, Lindsay.You do have way too much stuff, though. And possibly you shouldn't have moved it all until you had found an apartment in New York. As you say yourself, living in a hotel means you can't get a workout schedule or go to meetings or get a sponsor.I'm not sure why that is, precisely, but you said it quite convincingly and if that is the case, then surely you could have sent someone on ahead to find you a flat. If only so you didn't have to dump all your stuff on your mom, which meant hanging with Dina. Something that hasn't always gone so well. In the past.I'm certain your personal assistant, Matt, could have found you a place, or your sober coach Doug, a man who seems remarkably unfazed by your refusal to attend a meeting because of all the paparazzi who somehow knew to gather outside your hotel (first clue: film crew).Frankly, between the assistant, the coach, the driver (black SUV because nothing says ""I just want my privacy"" like a black SUV), the coterie of unnamed security guards and the film crew, you probably could have put together a small AA meeting in your hotel room. Heck, some of the paparazzi are probably sober, right?You see, Lindsay? It's difficult for even a sympathetic viewer to watch you shopping and smoking and complaining about how your last judge was ""punishing me instead of helping me"" without making a crack or two.The ads for Cliffside Malibu also do not help.Nor do the scenes in which you throw tantrums about a photo shoot that is not going the way you thought it would or a real estate agent who is not dropping everything to get you into the one apartment you finally decide you like. In one priceless moment, you were telling the audience, with obvious sincerity, that you were just trying to figure out how to live in a sane way and figure out how to do it yourself. You remember? You were wearing a Wonder Woman-like gold headband and a dress cut down to there to a Fashion Week event while, back at the hotel, Matt and your team raced around moving all your crap from one hotel room to another.As a TV critic, I cannot deny it made for some great if painful television. As someone who would like to see you stay sober and get healthy, well, honey, this show is so not a good idea."	Entertainment

205	"Lindsay Lohan is infamous for her hard partying, addiction, convictions and severe lack of common sense or self-control. Lindsay Lohan, a once-legitimately talented actress, has become a cautionary tale of young Hollywood. Lohan has six rehab stays, multiple arrests, convictions and probation violations under her belt, and every time the public starts to root for her, she goes and inexplicably puts herself back at square one. Lindsay Lohan has been given more chances than is seemingly acceptable and she realizes that—or so she says.Lindsay Lohan’s docu-series premiered on OWN Sunday night. Many people were shocked that Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful women in the world, would put her faith in Lohan given the girl’s disaster of a track record. The episode opened with Oprah interviewing Lindsay Lohan, who claimed that she wanted to “show the real me” and “ to live life with integrity.”For the most part, the show is pretty tame. It follows Lindsay Lohan and her wranglers (which includes her sober coach—who isn’t convinced that Lohan is sober) mere days after she was released from her latest rehab stay in Malibu. Lohan packs up her stuff and returns to New York, where she tries to find an apartment. She claims she needs to be settled and can no longer live in hotels, because the instability helps enable her behavior. It’s small gems of entitlement and inability to take responsibility for her actions like this that made viewers roll their eyes. The most telling part of the episode is when Lindsay Lohan complains that the judge refused to release her from jail even though there was overcrowding because “an example needed to be made” of her. Lohan fails to see that maybe her jail stay was extended because she committed a multitude of crimes and actually deserved jail time. It seems that thought never crossed her mind.Another cringe-worthy moment came from Lindsay Lohan’s mother, Dina. As she helps Lohan unpack boxes, they come across a t-shirt with the word “Fetch” printed on it. “Fetch” has been a decade-long joke from “Mean Girls,” which was Lindsay Lohan’s biggest hit at the height of her career. However, Dina doesn’t get it. It’s painful to watch Lindsay Lohan explain to her mother that it’s a line from “Mean Girls,” as it is the most successful film her daughter has ever done and the success of the movie no doubt paid for Dina’s house. Moments like this make the viewers feel bad for Lindsay Lohan.All in all, the episode was relatively dull. People expecting “Jersey Shore”-style debauchery are out of luck. However, Lohan’s unprofessional and selfish nature seems more prevalent in the preview for next week’s episode, as she refuses to film and enrages Oprah Winfrey. The problem is that Lohan seems to have finally run out of luck and the public just doesn’t care enough either way.Your email address will not be published.Comment Name Email Website

206	Troubled actress is set to make a guest appearance in hit US sitcom 2 Broke Girls, so we're celebrating her best TV moments to dateLindsay Lohan is a very busy lady as 2014 rolls on.Not only has her own reality series Lindsay aired its first episode on Oprah Winfrey's OWN network, the headline-making actress is also set to make a guest appearance in hit sitcom 2 Broke Girls.The 27-year-old star is set to play bride-to-be Claire Guinness in the CBS show, and her character asks Max (Kat Dennings) and Caroline (Beth Behrs) to make her wedding cake.Obviously not all goes to plan, as the duo quickly reality Lindsay's character struggles with decision making.This won't be the first time she's made a cameo appearance on TV, with a whole host of roles to her name. We've picked out five of the best for you to look back on. The popular sitcom launched the careers of the likes of real-life lovebirds Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, and Lindsay was part of its seventh series.She appeared in one episode as Danielle, alongside her then-partner Wilmer Valderrama as one of his character Fez's customers at the salon.It worked out well for Fez, with Danielle ditching a date with Kelso (Ashton) and takes him out instead.Initially set for a longer run, Lindsay appeared as Betty's high school nemesis in four episode.It was reported she was originally booked for six, but reported clashes with star America Ferrara - and apparent attitude issues - meant her run was cut short.The first on our list which saw the star play herself, a couple of years ago Lindsay appeared in the popular musical drama.During an episode in the third season of the Fox show, she was a judge at Nationals - alongside gossip blogger Perez Hilton - where the New Directions are competing.In another appearance as a version of herself, Lindsay was able to have a laugh at her own expense when she starred opposite Charlie Sheen.She hired his character to be her anger-management therapist on the set of a commercial, but typically it all goes wrong when they end up sleeping together and the paparazzi get wind of the situation.Perhaps not her proudest moment, but certainly her most recent TV cameo, Lindsay didn't have any lines for this one.Still, she took on the role of Kenny Powers' daughter in the fourth series finale of the HBO comedy and looked happy enough in her brief appearance.

209	"TrendingIs there anyone out there who doesn’t still feel at least a tiny bit sympathetic toward Lindsay Lohan? Sure, she’s messed up a whole lot, but who hasn’t? And she always seems so earnest after every slip-up, insisting that this time will be different. Lindsay premiered on OWN on March 9, and we have to say that, as much as we’re rooting for her, we’re not so sure that she’s ready to change. Read on for our full recap and tell us if you agree with us, or if Lindsay is really ready to move on from her checkered past!






Lindsay opens with a black title card telling the viewers that taping for this docu-series began on Aug. 3, four days after the completion of her 90-day court-ordered rehab stint at Cliffside Malibu.[hl_ndn videoid=”25691399″][hl_ndn videoid=”25691541″]Before her famous Oprah interview which aired August 18, Oprah asks Lindsay what her goal is for their interview and for the following docu-series. Lindsay tells her that her goal is to be open and honest, to which Oprah tells her, essentially, that she will then call her on any of her BS.“I want you to win,” Oprah tells Lindsay. Oprah speaks for us on this, as in all things.Eleven days after leaving rehab, Lindsay tells Amy Rice, the Emmy-nominated director of Lindsay, that she is in a “very good place.”It looks like Lindsay is looking to get out of LA, however; we see her packing an enormous amount of belongings in order to ship them to New York. Another title card tells us that in 2007, Lindsay had 2 DUI convictions, 36 months of probation, and 3 stays in rehab.From 2010 to 2012, there was a theft charge, a violation of probation, and 4th and 5th stays in rehab. Gosh, this docu-series is going to be an enormous bummer if it doesn’t end in Lindsay emerging from a wellness cocoon, a beautiful sober butterfly.In 2013, she was charged with wreckless driving, lying to a police officer, violation of probation, and she had a 6th stay in rehab.In a talking head, Lindsay tells us that there’s no party that she hasn’t gone to, no situation she hasn’t experienced, and that there’s nothing left for her in having a drink.Back in New York, we follow Lindsay on her apartment hunt in SoHo. Michael Cormier, Lindsay’s sober coach, is along for the ride.Oh, now this is rude: a friend of Lindsay’s, Chrissie Miller, tells her how amazing she was in The Canyons, just delivering the most effusive praise you’ve ever heard. Then, we see a clip of the Canyons, with lettering on the bottom telling us its box office gross of $51,135. Rude, OWN! Rude, Lindsay editors!Running behind schedule on the apartment hunt, it’s time for an impromptu shopping trip at her friend Wendy Nichol‘s shop! Because why not? Because when you’re Lindsay Lohan, why not be late to an appointment because you’ve decided you need to change your dress? Ooh, this better not be an omen of things to come. Lindsay, we’re rooting for you!!






Matt Harrell, Lindsay’s personal assistant, thinks that this docu-series is the best possible opportunity for her to turn her life around. Also, he assisted Prince for five years. Which means we’re obsessed with him.Moving on, Lindsay arrives at her mother’s — Dina Lohan‘s — house to unpack and sort through her belongings from LA. She tells us that family grounds her, etc., and yet the intertitle tells us that Lindsay did not see her mother at all during her 90-day stay at Cliffside Malibu.In a catastrophically depressing moment, Lindsay pulls out a pink t-shirt with “Fetch” written on, shows Dina, and Dina is like, “Oh… cool?” and Lindsay is all, “Um, it’s from Mean Girls? My last noteworthy role which came out one decade ago?” (We’re paraphrasing.) My god, you guys. Not only does she keep these mementos from the good times, but she brings them along with her from coast to coast. Shut up, you’re crying and watching Mean Girls on repeat!Another intertitle tells us that, after 20 days in NYC, “Lindsay still hasn’t found an apartment.” These title cards are super judgmental — please, OWN: even if you’re mega-rich, finding an apartment in NYC is an awful, garbage task. It’s the great equalizer. Still on your side, Lindsay!!The title cards, whom we now consider to be animate, dear friends, helpfully inform the viewer that Lindsay’s been invited to the Venice Film Festival for the premiere of The Canyons. GQ has offered to pay for her flight, but only if she appears at their event in London. We’re just gonna call it right now: she is emphatically not going to that event. We’re still rooting for Lindsay, but we’re not dummies.Instead of simply flaking on it, though, Lindsay’s reason for not going makes a lot of sense. She doesn’t want the conversation to be all about her treatment and laments the fact that she’s not in another production and can’t talk about that, instead.Back in her hotel room, Lindsay sorts out some of her jewelry and tells us that she lost of a lot of it when “those kids” robbed her house — The Bling Ring. We’re not so sure that Lindsay has truly repented for her past mistakes, though, because when she recounts her time spent in jail for a probation violation in 2010, she says that she saw Alexis Neiers, one of The Bling Ring, get released before her. She said:“The judge that I had at the time kept overruling [my release], even though they were overcrowded. She kept making me stay there. What they were doing was just punishing me, instead of trying to help me. They didn’t get it. It was all about being tough with me, and making me an example.” We don’t want to be the ones to say this, but we will: isn’t that what jail is about? When you’ve broken the law? Like, a lot? Sure, it’s supposed to be rehabilitative more than a true punishment, but Lindsay was lucky enough to skate on the DUI — which, you know, can kill people. She made the choice to violate her probation, and so off to jail she went.Lindsay doesn’t want to go to her AA meeting because there are “45 paparazzi” outside — there are maybe 4 paparazzi milling about. She says she wants to go, but she can’t. Amy — the director — asks her if she ever feels like a prisoner. “All the time.”At a lingerie shoot she agreed to be in for friends, Lindsay has a breakdown because the shoot is not what she expected. She bails. She also bailed on the flight to the Venice Film Festival, by the way. The director of The Canyons, Paul Shraeder, was not pleased, and called Lindsay out at their panel.“After looking at ten apartments, Lindsay has found one she likes.” Intertitles, stop judging! NYC real estate is a nightmare! Lindsay is upset because she feels like her broker is not giving her enough attention. Michael, more yes man than sober coach, feeds her fervor by insisting that she’s right, that her broker should be giving her more attention!Michael tells us, in a talking head, that Lindsay is trying to create stability for herself. So, of course, Lindsay requests to change hotel rooms, within the same hotel. Matt is off to make the switch, entering her hotel room which has turned into a Hoarders-esque situation that is truly something to behold. “This woman’s got sh** like you wouldn’t believe. It’s impressive,” Matt says. We think we love Matt.And that’s pretty much it. It was an anti-climactic end to the episode, but it was certainly telling. At the end of the day, Lindsay says one thing but means another. She’s a bundle of frustrating contradictions and she’s constantly getting in her own way, but honestly, she seems just so helplessly confused by it all that you want her to come out the other side. Hopefully at the end of Lindsay‘s 8-episode run we’ll be able to see that! Our fingers are still crossed.What did you think of Lindsay, HollywoodLifers? Are you rooting for her or are you just waiting for a hot mess? Be sure to vote and comment below with your thoughts!

	Lindsay Lohan's hopes of reinventing herself as an actress on the mend and a sober, calm and pulled together person are largely tied to the new series Lindsay.
	At least after one episode, the jury is still out.
	The 27-year-old was filmed for a new eight-part Lindsay reality series last year for Oprah Winfrey's OWN network, chronicling her life and experiences post-rehab.
	On many cases, that life still looks turbulent.

	She states her desire to live with integrity and be in control, yet seems awfully unsure of how to achieve that, despite moving back to her native New York.
	""Coming back to New York I needed a change, a fresh start, a clean slate and I needed to be close to my family,"" she revealed during the hour long show.
	""Life can be chaotic and it's keeping myself calm in the middle of that which I didn't do before and I'm learning to do,"" LiLo added ... but is she learning?
	""It's really stressful finding a place in New York,"" the actress, who recently spoke of a Mean Girls reunion for the show's 10-year anniversary, lamented.
	""The boards who have to approve you, they're like, 'Oh it's Lindsay Lohan. Oh will she be having late, loud nights? We don't want her in our building.'""
	""Or 'Oh great, we'll have her in the  building. Let's up the price!'""
	As she was filmed storming off the set of a photo shoot after growing flustered, the fragile star revealed that it was a case of too much too soon.
	Constantly flanked by her sober coach and a personal assistant, Lindsay was seen veering from being tearfully happy to agitated and angrily chastising others.
	""Do you ever feel like you're a prisoner?"" Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice asked, regarding the paparazzi attention. ""Yes, all the time,"" she replied.
	Fortunately, there is always family ... well, maybe fortunately.
	""It's comforting to be around my family and they are a huge part of my recovery,"" she concluded, with no mention of previous dramas with her parents.
	""There's so much love in all my family members... It really will be nice when there's no more talking and only positive things will be said and that day will come...""
	How soon, if at all, remains an open question.
Lindsay Lohan: Can she stay clean?

211	Lindsay Lohan‘s self-titled reality TV show on Oprah Winfrey‘s OWN channel depicted the troubled star as an ornery prima donna in its’ premiere Sunday, and we’ve got all the details for you right here on RadarOnline.com.On its’ first night, Lindsay — a documentary series about Lohan’s life after getting out of rehab — the actress was shown storming off the set of a lingerie shoot, ranting to her real estate agent, and forcing her personal assistant to get her a new hotel room after leaving her original one in shambles.“My intention is to just be me,” recovering alcoholic Lohan told Winfrey in starting her new TV journey.PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Been In RehabAnd was she ever!Viewers were treated to scenes of Lohan claiming to be in a better place and “excited to start this new chapter” — but then reverting to her old hard-to-work-with ways.Just 34 days out of rehab, Lohan was shown making a cameo in a film to promote a lingerie line — and immediately having issues with producer Jeremy Frommer.“This is not the way I would show off lingerie,” Lohan told Frommer after hearing what she had to do.PHOTOS: The Price Of Fame: The 10 Most Ridiculous Celebrity Appearance Fees“I thought this was a photo shoot that was going to be filmed,” Lohan told OWN’s cameras. “And then they added this weird dialogue. I don’t like being lied to.”When Frommer tried to get to the bottom of what was bugging Lohan, she said, “When we discussed this … I was the girl that had the love story. That was interesting to me. That’s why I wanted to do this.”Lohan’s personal assistant, Matt Harrell, told the cameras, “They wanted to change the script … that’s not what we agreed upon.”When Lohan told Frommer she’d rather be in London promoting her movie The Canyons, the producer got angry and blamed Lohan’s schedule for the problems.PHOTOS: Linsay Lohan Gets Police Escort In London“Listen to me!” Lohan then said, pointing at shocked Frommer. “Now I’m getting p***** off. I canceled my f***ing trip! Don’t put words in my mouth.”Lohan started to cry, then said, “This is not what I signed up for,” and stormed out of the makeup area.Frommer attempted to clear the air with the out-of-control star later, but Lohan said she felt uncomfortable with the shoot, and ultimately pulled out of it.PHOTOS: Hall Of Shame: The Lohan Family Mugshot AlbumAlso during the episode, viewers saw the drama of Lohan moving back to New York and looking for a new apartment in Soho.But when Lohan finally found a place she liked, the recovering party girl was convinced her real estate agent, Cash Bernard, wasn’t working hard enough to seal the deal.In a tense phone conversation with Bernard, Lohan said, “What EXACTLY is it going to take to get the keys?! I hear it in in the tone of your voice, how lackadaisical you are about it.”After finding out a $10 million liability policy had been put in her lease, Lohan went ballistic, shouting to Bernard over the phone, “They can’t just add that to the lease! How the hell can anyone have that?! I’m not Oprah. I can’t get that!”PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan At Chakana NightclubFollowing the apartment debacle on Sunday’s show, her assistant Harrell had to pick up the pieces.After living in a New York hotel for 36 days, antsy Lohan suddenly decided she had to get an entirely new room in the same hotel where she’d been staying.Harrell had to quickly transfer all of Lohan’s clothes and personal items into a new room before she came back from watching her sister, Ali Lohan, do a runway modeling job.“I was the lucky guy that got to switch everything over. This woman’s got s*** you couldn’t believe,” Harrell sighed as he cleaned the room, which looked like it belonged to a hoarder!PHOTOS: There Goes That Resolution! Lindsay Lohan Sports Thigh-Highs While Partying Into The Night In LondonWhile Harrell did all the dirty work, Lohan improbably told the cameras she remembered “being in this bubble where everything was done for me.. Now I’m figuring everything out for myself.”Watch the video on RadarOnline.comLindsay Lohan: “I Know That This Is My Last Shot”Since 2007, Lindsay Lohan has had two DUI convictions, a handful of probation violations and six stays in rehab. Now, the starlet says she has one last shot at doing what she loves to do. Watch as she explains why there’s “nothing left” in drinking and partying for her anymore and reveals what kind of life she wants for herself now.Then, the cameras switched back to Harrell, who was surprised to see Lohan’s hotel mini-bar was empty!Earlier in the episode, the assistant had sounded optimistic about a new life for the former Mean Girls‘ star, who is now better known for her arrests than her acting.“If she screws this up — she knows what’s at stake,” Harrell said.But Lohan — who also got help from sober coach Michael Cormier, visited her mother, Dina Lohan, and dodged the ever-present paparazzi on the Sunday reality show — apparently can’t help herself!

215	"Lindsay Lohan was born on July 2, 1986, the first child of Dina and Michael Lohan, who would go on to give the star three younger siblings, Michael Jr., Cody, and Aliana. Lohan’s parents had a stormy marriage, and continued to battle publicly and privately even after their 2007 divorce.Lohan’s career kicked off when she began modeling at just three years old, before doing dozens and dozens of commercials. Following a turn on the soap opera “Another World,” her big break came when she was cast in the dual lead roles for the 1998 remake of “The Parent Trap,” playing twins opposite Dennis Quaid. Lohan received high praise, and went on to star in a number of teen-friendly films, including “Freaky Friday,” “Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,” and “Mean Girls.”In 2004, Lohan released her first single, “Rumors,” and her debut album, “Speak,” which went all the way to number four on the Billboard 200 chart. But following several more films and another record, Lohan’s career started to derail in 2006 with personal and professional problems that led to a 30-day stint in rehab in early 2007. Just a few months later, the actress was arrested for DUI. She again entered treatment, was released after 45 days, and had a second DUI fewer than two weeks later, during which she was also caught possessing cocaine.After a guilty plea, Lohan was placed on three years probation, went to rehab for a third time, and while ordered to spend a day in jail, ultimately served just 84 minutes due to overcrowding. Lohan’s probation was extended in 2009 after she failed to complete required counseling, and her career continued to suffer due to sporadic projects that failed to find any success. In 2010, a judge determined Lohan had violated her probation, and ordered her to serve 90 days in jail, of which she only ended up behind bars for 14. She was also supposed to spend 90 days in rehab, but left after 23 days.After a failed drug test later that year, Lohan once again entered rehab, staying at the Betty Ford Center for three months. In early 2011, Lohan was arrested for allegedly stealing a necklace, and after pleading no contest, she was sentenced to 120 days in jail, but ended up doing 35 days of home detention instead. Months later, Lohan was again ordered to jail for a probation violation, but spent only five hours locked up.Lohan seemed on the brink of a comeback in 2012, with a Playboy spread and a well-received turn as “SNL” host. But a car accident on her way to filming the TV movie “Liz & Dick” ultimately led to charges of reckless driving and lying to police. She pleaded no contest, and was sentenced to 90 days in rehab. Upon her release in 2013, Lohan filmed a reality show for Oprah’s OWN network, documenting her attempts to rebuild her life. It aired in 2014, and Lohan revealed on the finale that she had suffered a miscarriage in the months before.With her last film, “The Canyons,” ripped by critics, Lohan set her sights on the stage, and made her West End debut in “Speed-the-plow” in the fall of 2014. She completed the run without incident. Lohan nevertheless remains a tabloid target, and is routinely romantically linked to various people, even though she hasn’t seriously dated anyone since Samantha Ronson.February 8th, 2018January 15th, 2018January 4th, 2018December 23rd, 2017November 3rd, 2017October 6th, 2017September 28th, 2017August 6th, 2017July 6th, 2017June 22nd, 2017April 14th, 2017March 19th, 2017March 5th, 2017March 1st, 2017February 20th, 2017« Previous

217	"The troubled star was seen struggling to keep her emotions in check during the first show which aired last night in the USALindsay Lohan's hopes of reinventing herself as sober, calm and together were hindered last night as viewers of her new docu-series saw her lose her cool in a series of angry outbursts.The 27-year-old actress was filmed for new eight part series Lindsay last summer as documentary makers from Oprah Winfrey's OWN network followed her experiences moving back to her native New York after a 90-day stint of court-ordered rehab.But while Lindsay was seen stating her desire to live with integrity and be in control of herself, the troubled star was seen struggling to  keep her emotions in check during the first show which aired last night in the USA.""Coming back to New York I needed a change, a fresh start, a clean slate and I needed to be close to my family,"" she revealed during the hour long documentary. ""Life can be chaotic and it's keeping myself calm in the middle of that which I didn't do before and I'm learning to do.""However as the camera followed Lindsay's efforts to find somewhere to live in SoHo, New York, she was seen getting increasingly worked up.""It's really stressful finding a place in New York,"" the Mean Girls actress admitted. ""The boards who have to approve you, they're like, 'Oh it's Lindsay Lohan. Oh will she be having late, loud nights? We don't want her in our building.' Or 'Oh great, we'll have her in the  building. Let's up the price!'""Later as she was filmed storming off the set of a photo shoot after growing agitated that the brief had been changed the fragile star revealed it was a case of too much too soon.She said: ""That was me trying to do something to feel like I'm on set... and I shouldn't have done that as I compromised myself and my sobriety and my sanity by being in that headspace by being stressed out.""Constantly flanked by her sober coach and a personal assistant, Lindsay was seen veering from being tearfully happy at the sight of her sister modelling at a runway show to angrily chastising her broker for being 'lazy' when it came to securing the home she so desperately desired to get settled.Her planned trip to an AA meeting was also thwarted by the 40-odd paparazzi camped outside her hotel. ""Do you ever feel like you're a prisoner?"" Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice was heard asking the actress during filming.""Yes, all the time,"" she replied.While paying a visit to her mother's Lindsay once again expressed her desire to escape the chaos of her former life and find some normality.""It's comforting to be around my family and they are a huge part of my recovery,"" she concluded, with no mention of previous dramas with her parents. ""There's so much love in all my family members... It really will be nice when there's no more talking and only positive things will be said and that day will come...""But as highlights of the next episode of the docu-series showed more clips of an irate Lindsay crying and losing her temper, she clearly has some way to go."

218	"""There's nothing left in having a drink for me,” Lindsay insists on her new show 27-year-old actress Lindsay Lohan was filmed for new eight part series Lindsay last summer as documentary makers from Oprah Winfrey's OWN network followed her experiences moving back to her native New York after a 90-day stint of court-ordered rehab.  After the first episode hit US screens at 10pm last night, here is what we learned. Eleven days out of rehab, one Oprah interview down and planning her move back to New York, Lindsay seemed pretty zen.“I’m in this really good place where I have this inner peace right now,” she declared cheerfully. “All the distractions and chaos that go on outside just in daily life in general don’t really affect me anymore.”""There's nothing left in having a drink for me,” Lindsay insists. “There's no party that I haven't gone to, there's no person that I haven't hung out with, there's no situation that I haven't been exposed to. Some of it was fun, some of it was really not, but I've had that. So I want to try another way for me…”When Li-lo said she was off to get her stuff from storage we envisaged a fairly extensive shoe collection, but zillions of boxes of junk, tat, Mean Girls’ t-shirts and some kind of sparkly mannequin? Ay Caramba!“I’m moving everything I’ve accumulated in eight or nine years in Los Angeles to New York…” she sighed while rifling half-heartedly through a few boxes.“So I still have to go to my mom’s, she still has stuff in storage,” she casually added no doubt prompting a wince of pain from her personal assistant.We’re pretty sure he’d like to go back and work for ex-employer Steven Tyler right now.At the start of the show Oprah Winfrey (who appeared very fleetingly) advised Lindsay not to go on her planned trip to Europe. So Lindsay didn’t go to Europe.Then Lindsay thought about going to Europe for the Venice Film Festival but ultimately decided not to go to Europe.Then at a photo shoot she’d agreed to do for a friend Lindsay felt she’d been lied to about the brief and regretted not going to Europe.“I want to be in London right now,” she told him tearfully. “I cancelled my f****** trip… I cancelled flying out. This is exactly not what I signed up for.”Cue a disgruntled Li-Lo pulling out the shoot.Oh and she didn’t go to Europe. As two smug members of the paparazzi were seen gleefully salivating over how much a snap of Lindsay would earn them, the lady herself was hiding indoors . “We’ve been stuck in the room all day because there’s like 40 paparazzi outside and I really don’t feel like dealing with them today,” she revealed.“I can’t go to the meeting I was supposed to go to as I don’t want them following me to an AA meeting as it’s just not cool for anyone else there.”“When somebody promises me something and then breaks that promise I lose all trust in them,” Lindsay revealed in an outburst about the broker who still hasn’t secured her a home. “It happened when I was a kid with my dad.”Cue an ear-bashing for said ‘lazy’ broker.“What exactly is it going to take to get me the keys?” she ranted down the phone as her people looked on despondently. “They want a 10 million dollar insurance policy? How the hell could anyone have that? I’m not Oprah!”The preview for week two gave glimpses of Lindsay in meltdown, yelling and crying plus getting a dressing down from Oprah.“The vultures are waiting to pick your bones,” the chat-host legend warns.Oh Lindsay, we really were rooting for you..."

219	"The 27-year-old 'Mean Girls' star apparently kept a diary during her rehab stint in 2013 and that would be the base of the book, reported Aceshowbiz. ""It's more or less an autobiography, but she had a minimal number of sample pages. There was initial interest, but everybody backed off. There was concern she wouldn't deliver,"" a source said. A representative for the publishing house however declined to comment. Lohan's publicist Tej Herring, meanwhile, said that ""there have been some conversations, but nothing official yet.""

        ""Lindsay"" was touted as a docuseries chronicling Lindsay Lohan's ""attempts to build a new life"" in New York City following her sixth stint in rehab. 
      
        But the premiere, which aired Sunday on Oprah Winfrey's OWN network, could just have easily been an episode of A&E's ""Hoarders"" or ""Intervention,"" or even Britney Spears' ""Chaotic"" (the word pops up a lot in ""Lindsay""). 
      
        Emmy-nominated director Amy Rice interspersed the shots with on-the-street interviews and the grim statistics of Lohan's career nosedive, from plummeting box-office numbers to her numerous arrests and stints in rehab. But according to the actress, her cross-country move meant a step on the latest road to redemption. ""Lindsay"" offers a revealing glimpse into the troubled star's everyday life — and a closet full of skeletons. Or at least necklaces.  
      
Buried aliveLindsay Lohan has a lot of stuff. Enough to fill a cavernous warehouse — where we found the actress, 11 days out of rehab, when the series began. With film crew in tow, she cherry-picked which items she planned to store at mother Dina Lohan's Long Island apartment in preparation for her move to the Big Apple. The cameras also captured the ""Liz & Dick"" star's nostalgia over the mementos she saved from her much-lampooned portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor in the Lifetime biopic. 

        But she also kept souvenirs from her glory days, like the ""Mean Girls"" ""Fetch"" T-shirt she brandished at her mom's place — now overrun with boxes of her daughter's possessions. Like ""fetch"" — the catchphrase that was ""never gonna happen"" — Lindsay's quest for an apartment seemed hopeless. By the end of the first episode, she had been living in hotels for more than a month — her clothes and jewelry strewn across nearly every inch of furniture and floor space, more like a flophouse squatter than a ritzy hotel guest. 
      Lindsay's+hotel+room+is+the+absolute+best+episode+of+#Hoarders
Bling ring Lohan would be spreading even more jewelry on the carpet if it weren't stolen by Alexis Neiers, one of the notorious ""bling ring"" thieves who targeted the actress and other Hollywood celebrities. ""Lindsay"" is saturated in irony, but perhaps the greatest of all — from the star's perspective — is the fact that Neiers occupied an adjacent jail cell but was released when she ""got put in."" 

        ""They kept making me stay there,"" she complained about the judge who vetoed her own early release. Whatever sympathy the LiLo had from viewers at the start of the show, it shrank noticeably when she whined, ""They were punishing me instead of trying to help me!"" 
      Seriously+Lindsay??+The+judge+was+punishing+you+by+putting+you+in+jail+and+should+have+helped+you?+Whaatt!You+broke+the+law!+#LindsayonOWN
Blame gameThe premiere didn't do any favors for Lohan's reputation for unreliable behavior. She ran out sobbing from a friend's film shoot, in which she was to cameo as an ""intellectual"" who ""gets absorbed into the world of beauty and lingerie.""

        The filmmaker had to scrap an entire day's work when she pulled out, but Lohan insisted, ""I'm not an actress turned model,"" adding, petulantly, ""My sister's the model in my family."" (Not that there's anything wrong with that. She did support Aliana during her first fashion show in another segment.) 
      
        She also canceled a London promotion for ""The Canyons"" (which, despite her friend gushing that ""it's gonna be a cult movie,"" made only $51,000) and the film's Venice Film Festival press junket — where the embittered director, Paul Schrader, told the press, ""I've been a hostage of my own choosing to a very talented but unpredictable actress."" 
      
        It's a Catch-22: Lohan's potential landlords are requiring an astronomical $10 million insurance policy, but she can't (or won't) work — or workout, or get an AA sponsor — because she doesn't have a ""sanctuary"" to call home and help clear her ""headspace.""
      
Lohan in cars, getting coffeeBut Lohan and her realtor, Cash Bernard (a name made for reality television), didn't give up. In fact, much of the hourlong program featured the actress, sipping Starbucks with her posse (which also included her PA and a ""sober coach"") and driving around the city. (Ten different shots involved Lohan entering, exiting or riding in a chauffeured SUV.) 

        And yet, though Lohan pointed to her dedication to her sobriety as the reason for backing out of her professional commitments, she skipped AA meetings because of the paparazzi hounding her. 
      
        ""Look at my watch,"" one of the insensitive photographers bragged to the documentary crew. ""Lindsay paid for it.""
      
        Oprah, as usual, said it best: ""The vultures are waiting to pick your bones,"" she warned Lohan in the previews for the rest of the season. Some highlights: The actress clashes with her assistant, bails on the docueries' filmmaker and causes her coach to question her sobriety. 
      
        ""This is exactly what everybody said was gonna happen, and I believed differently,"" said Oprah. ""I believed she was ready."" 
      
        But not everyone is losing faith. Many fans tweeted their support during their show — and plan to keep watching Lohan's story unfold.

224	"With: Lindsay LohanOWN has sought to surround “Lindsay” – its docu-series devoted to Lindsay Lohan – with a patina of seriousness and quality, from touting the involvement of director Amy Rice (“By The People: The Election of Barack Obama”) to preceding it with a showcase in which the channel’s namesake interviews Russell Brand about addiction. But seriously, who’s fooling whom? In the best Hollywood tradition, the Oprah Winfrey-Discovery network and the tabloid-plagued actress are using each other, the irony being that if Lohan stays on the straight and narrow, she’ll yield a show as boring as Sunday’s not-screened-in-advance premiere.Frankly, one appreciates Lohan’s efforts to stay clean and sober. But it shouldn’t come as a newsflash to anyone – starting with Oprah – that the dramatic needs of reality TV and straightening out her life are mutually exclusive.






The show picks up last August, right after Lohan has finished her sixth stint in rehab. While alcohol, she says, has been her drug of choice, it’s clear another kind of high comes from staying in the spotlight.The opening runs through Lohan’s spotted history of arrests and slip-ups, while incorporating the “backstage” portion of her Oprah interview, before filming the series began.

Film Review: 'The Widowed Witch'




Mostly, the show is filled with meta moments. There’s the spectacle, for example, of the cameras filming Lohan being photographed by the paparazzi staking out the hotel where she’s living (they become what amount to extras throughout); or her assistant, Matt Harrell, saying the actress knows the OWN project amounts to a last chance, and thus that she won’t screw things up.Still, it’s hard to see what screwing up would entail in this context, other than falling completely off the wagon, while Lohan’s sober coach, Michael Cormier, keeps a watchful eye on her.So what’s left? Lindsay talking to the camera, without makeup; Lindsay visiting her mom, Dina; Lindsay trying on hats; Lindsay looking for an apartment; Lindsay having a minor meltdown at a modeling shoot.At this rate, Linday watching paint dry is a pretty good subplot for episode three.Frankly, “Lindsay” says far more about OWN than it does about Lohan. Having already handed a fair amount of time over to Tyler Perry, the channel continues to drift farther away from the “Oprah” brand in pursuit of hits.That’s worked, to a point, but it also dispels the notion that Oprah’s magic touch would somewhat make broccoli TV palatable.“The vultures are waiting to pick your bones,” Oprah tells Lohan in the “this season on” tease, as if – in this context – her channel isn’t taking a taste. In that respect, “Lindsay” represents another form of addiction, and spinning things any other way is simply putting lipstick on it.TV Review: 'Lindsay'(Series; OWN, Sun.

226	"Lindsay on OWN – Season 1, Episode 1 recapBy Nicole YoungblutLast night was the anticipated premiere of Lindsay, directed by Amy Rice on OWN. Two days after exiting rehab at Cliffside Manor, Lindsay Lohan sits down with Oprah and discusses her new life path of sobriety.In the first episode, Lindsay cancelled her yoga and meditation retreat in Europe after Oprah cautioned against it.  Then, she moves back to New York from LA to be closer to family. Lindsay is working with her sober coach, Micheal Corimer, to integrate the tools needed to stay sober into daily life. She states family as a huge part of her recovery.The show portrays her daily life struggle of rebuilding her personal life, while dealing with addiction.  Adjusting to a move back to New York, finding an apartment, and arguing with brokers that try to take advantage of her by raising housing market prices on account of her celebrity.New York City with its fashion parties and nightlife has too many temptations for Lindsay’s recovery. Is it better than L.A.? Maybe. Her family is there, but it seems like she’s trading one hot bed of temptation for another.One day, Lindsay and her film crew could not leave her hotel room, because of the swarm of paparazzi outside.  Lindsay feels like a prisoner.  She has to worry about the added stress of paparazzi following her to an AA meeting, so she doesn’t want to go.Does this docuseries expose a relatable human side of Lindsay Lohan? Even with all of her fame and wealth, she still has some of the daily struggles of family problems, relocating to a new city and finding personal inner peace.Is New York City the best place for Lindsay’s recovery?  I’ll be watching Lindsay on OWN next Sunday to find out!_______________________Courtesy of OWN: Oprah Winfrey NetworkCurious to see how the show plays out, will def be watching.looking forward to watching it, looks and sounds interesting!!!I would be interested to hear, after the show has completed, Lindsay’s views

Viewers got their first look at Lindsay Lohan's new OWN docuseries, Lindsay, on Sunday night.The show, directed by the Emmy-nominated Amy Rice, took viewers through Lohan's move to New York following her release from rehab, her search for an apartment, her life in the media spotlight and a shoot she booked -- then backed out of -- for a lingerie line.PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan Through the YearsAfter incorporating parts of an interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired last year, the episode shows Lohan as she is 11 days out of rehab. She says she's found ""inner peace.""""All the distractions and the chaos that goes on … just in daily life in general, don't really affect me anymore,"" she says.The show also intersperses a timeline of Lohan's box-office and career successes with her various stints in rehab, court dates and charges for DUI, theft, reckless driving and other offenses. It also includes man-on-the-street interviews with various people commenting on Lohan, including one who said: ""I used to be a fan of her work. Not so much recently. She kind of fell off the deep end.""For her part, Lohan says she's starting a ""new chapter"" in her life. ""I know that this is my last shot at doing what I love to do. It does take getting to a really scary place and think you can do everything, but no you can't. And there is nothing left in having a drink for me. What's left in that feeling? Nothing. There is no party I haven't gone to, no person I haven't hung out with. There's no situation that I haven't been exposed to. There's nothing left in that for me to experience that I haven't already experienced.""Some of it was fun, some of it was really not, but I've had that. So maybe trying another way for me, which is living with integrity and living in control of my own self -- that's the life I want now.""Here's a rundown of what else viewers saw on Sunday night:The contents of Lohan's storage container.Lohan put all her belongings into storage while she was in rehab at Cliffside Malibu. Now that she's decided to move to New York, she must go through everything and have it shipped to her mother's house in Long Island. Among the contents are a black sequined-and-feathered gown that was just ""thrown into a box,"" as she put it; a cigarette holder that was a prop from a movie she shot; assorted clothing and furniture; memorabilia from the Lifetime movie Liz & Dick, in which she played Elizabeth Taylor; jewelry; and a Chinese fortune that reads, ""A long life is in store for you.""Lohan's search for an apartment -- and frustration with her real estate broker.Lohan looked at 10 apartments, but as she explains, the boards of all the buildings must approve any new resident, and she kept encountering one of two situations: ""It's 'We don’t want her in the building' or 'It's Lindsay, we'll up the price.' "" She eventually becomes frustrated with her real estate broker, Cash Bernard, after she's been living in a hotel for 36 days. ""I don't hear in your voice the urgency that maybe you don't recognize it and maybe you're not aware of it -- but that I feel and I have, and the stress that I have to get into a place,"" she tells him over the phone. She also becomes visibly annoyed when he tells her that a $10 million renter's liability policy is being required of her to sign a new lease in one building. ""Anyone can get that,"" he says. ""Not me,"" she snaps at him.PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian, Lindsay Lohan Among Famous Faces With Trout PoutsHer demands of her personal assistant.Matt Harrell, who has worked for everyone from Sean Astin to Steven Tyler to Prince, suddenly finds himself moving suitcases and suitcases full of Lohan's belongings when she decides on a whim that she wants to change hotel rooms. ""So I was the lucky guy that got to switch everything over,"" he says, adding: ""This woman's got s--t you wouldn't believe.""How she handles the paparazzi.Lohan is forced to skip an AA meeting and dinner plans with Michael Cormier, her sober coach, because of all the paparazzi camped outside her hotel. ""Being under a microscope and the lens of the media, it's difficult but … I'm so used to kind of living that way anyway that it doesn’t have that much of an effect on me,"" she says at one point. (Boasts one paparazzo to the camera: ""Look at my watch. Lindsay paid for it."") But at another point, she admits that she feels like a prisoner -- ""all the time."" ""We've been stuck in this room all day, actually, because there's been 40 paparazzi outside and I just really don't feel like dealing with them today,"" she says. ""I don't want them following me to an AA meeting. I feel like that's not cool for anyone else there.""The reason behind her decision to pull out of a short-film shoot.Lohan becomes visibly upset at a shoot for a lingerie line she'd agreed to take part in as a favor to some friends. She says she thought she was going to be part of a filmed photo shoot, but when she arrives on set, she's told she'll have dialogue and that the job is more than what she was told. ""I'm not an actress trying to model,"" she says of the setup explained to her, adding, ""I don't like being lied to,"" before pulling out of the shoot entirely.Why she skipped The Canyons premiere at the Venice Film Festival.GQ offered to pay her way to Italy if she made an appearance at its party. But after talking it over with Cormier, she decides she isn't at a point in her life where she is ready to travel overseas and resume that kind of work. Moreover, ""all [the media] are going to talk about is how my treatment was. if I were going to start another production in the next two weeks, at least I could talk about that too.""Her thoughts on her jail time.""The judge kept overruling me getting released even though [the jail was] overcrowded. They kept making me stay there. They were punishing me instead of trying to help me. They didn't get it, it was all about being the tough one with me and making an example. It wasn’t, 'How can we figure this out with this person?'""Her mom's confusion over ""Fetch.""Lohan also found several shirts with the word ""Fetch"" on them -- which, as anyone who's seen her 2004 hit Mean Girls knows, is a catchphrase from the movie. But her mother, Dina Lohan -- who, we find out, never visited her daughter during her most recent rehab stint -- has no idea what it means, and Lohan has to explain it to her.

228	"The build-up to “Lindsay” included a much-played clip in which Oprah Winfrey bluntly warns Lindsay Lohan to “cut the bull****."" The show, which debuted Sunday on Winfrey’s OWN channel, got off to a far milder start, with the daytime talk show legend telling the star-crossed former child star, “I want you to win.” Winfrey, the world’s supportive TV friend, clearly cares about Lohan, whose interrelated problems with family, alcohol and the law have overshadowed her acting talent. But while anyone with a heart is rooting for Lohan to turn her life around, it’s far from certain viewers will stick around to witness the BS that began to unfold during Sunday’s initial installment.Lohan says a lot of the right things to Winfrey and the cameras: She knows this is her “last shot.” She “feels different.” She’s finding “inner peace.”Her words, in the context of the show, offer the disturbing suggestion that Lohan is linking her public struggle for stability to the resurrection of her career nearly a decade after her peak in “Mean Girls.” It’s difficult to watch “Lindsay” without thinking she might be better off if nobody was watching.For all her talk about “inner peace,” there are plenty of signs of outer chaos as Lohan uses the paparazzi as an excuse to miss an AA meeting. She makes her assistant move her heap of clothes and junk from one hotel room to another because she’s feeling claustrophobic. She breaks down and walks off a shoot when she decides – not unreasonably – that a friend is taking advantage of her.""Lindsay"" is billed as an eight-part ""docu-series"" in an apparent bid to separate the program – and Winfrey – from the often-exploitative Reality TV genre. The show certainly isn't ""Keeping up with the Lohans"" – there aren’t signs of staging the action or manufacturing conflict.""Lindsay"" is less Reality TV than reality check TV, even if most folks in recovery aren’t fortunate enough to have a sobriety coach, drivers and assistants. Still, “Lindsay” succeeds in capturing the sadness, confusion and fragility of Lohan’s post-rehab life. She’s striving to emerge from the too-high pile of troubled former child stars  – a mound of misery that includes Michael Jackson, the most talented and most tragic of them all.Amanda Bynes, who experienced unfortunate public breakdown, recently tweeted to let her fans know she’s okay and in school. Hopefully, that’s last we’ll hear from Bynes for a while as she gets her life together. Lohan, who, like Bynes, is 27, can’t keep away from the public eye: She’s set to appear on “Two Broke Girls” April 14, and is slated to start filming a movie next month. On Thursday, she promoted “Lindsay” on “The Tonight Show,” seeming in good spirits as she told Jimmy Fallon she takes comfort in knowing Winfrey is always just a call away. As for her many problems, Lohan told Fallon, “That’s the past.”The past may not be as distant as Lohan would like. The cameras began following her just six months ago, days after she finished her latest rehab stint.Previews suggest that Winfrey’s tough talk comes in the next episode. But if Lohan’s going to “win,” she’s needs to take control of her life – whether or not Oprah or the rest of us are watching. Jere Hester is founding director of the award-winning, multi-media NYCity News Service at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism.

229	The narrative of the actress’ new show is set on the debut episode: Who’s the real enemy here?OWNThe much-anticipated OWN series starring Lindsay Lohan, titled simply “Lindsay,” already sets the season’s storyline on Sunday’s premiere episode: Who’s the biggest threat to Lohan? The outside world or the actress herself?Director Amy Rice followed the “Mean Girls” actress as she decided to relocate from Los Angeles to New York City. The actress felt that a change of scenery and being closer to her family would give her stability as she tries to stay sober. At one point, Lohan acknowledged that the next few months are important ones.“It’s my last shot,” the actress said of her career.See video: Lindsay Lohan Gets Doused in the Face by Jimmy FallonIn setting up the series, it shared Oprah Winfrey‘s pre-interview with the star ahead of the taping of her August interview on “Oprah’s Next Chapter.” Winfrey asked the question she poses to all her guests: What do you want from this interview?“Just to be me, be honest and open,” Lohan answered and Winfrey promised she’d call the actress out if she felt she wasn’t sticking to that path.The truth is probably the hardest thing to discern on the premiere episode. We hear what Lohan wants, but we’re unsure what happens off-camera and just how much she participates in situations where she feels others have wronged her.Also read: Lindsay Lohan to Guest Star on CBS’s ‘2 Broke Girls’There are plenty of examples of this on the episode. She promised to be in London to do press for her movie, “The Canyons,” but pulled out because she’s worried about how the pressure will affect her sobriety and that the press will really only want to ask her about her recent stint in rehab. In turn, director Paul Schrader told reporters that he felt like he “was held hostage” by the actress during the shooting of the film, clearly disappointed she was skipping out on its promotion.Yet, there are some real challenges to being Lindsay Lohan. The paparazzi are clearly out of control. They stood outside her hotel and followed her to events. One boldly held up his watch to OWN’s cameras and said, “Lindsay paid for it.”At one point, she’s unable to attend her AA meeting because the paparazzi would follow her there and she’s worried about the other people at the meeting and their privacy. When Rice asked if she ever felt like a she’s a prisoner, Lohan answered, “Yes, all the time.”Also read: Is Oprah Winfrey Exploiting Lindsay Lohan?She also goes for more than a month in New York City unable to find an apartment. Lohan said that finding the place is the easy part, but then the building’s board finds out who she is and doesn’t want her as a neighbor or they raise the rent. At one point, she’s very close to signing a lease when a last-minute clause requiring her to purchase a $10 million insurance policy gets added – something her realtor said is a standard amount though Lohan argues that she isn’t your standard renter. Truth.At other times, it’s clear Lohan may not know what she needs. She wants stability, yet she orders her personal assistant to switch her hotel room and move her belongings (which are strewn all over her hotel room like an episode of “Hoarders”).The show shoots only her second visit with her mother since leaving rehab. Why has she only seen her mother once since rehab if her family is such a force for stability? And, her father? Well, he hasn’t quite been her best protector either and has yet to appear during Lohan’s first month in NYC.See video: Oprah Winfrey Tells Lindsay Lohan to ‘Cut the Bulls–t’ in First Look at OWN SeriesShe’s a living example of contradictions. Lohan does come off as very courteous to others, greeting her drivers, the hotel staff who open the door for her, etc., though at one point she decided to change her clothes during a realtor appointment and literally goes shopping for new duds while the realtor stands outside on the sidewalk.It remains to be seen if Lohan can herself begin to decipher during the course of the season ahead the difference between when others are gunning for her and when she’s holding the gun.“Lindsay” airs Sundays at 10/9c on OWN.

	 Lindsay Lohan reads from her Betty Ford Center diary with mom Dina Lohan in a scene from her OWN docu-series, “Lindsay.""      Photo Credit: OWN     Of all the Lindsay Lohans we've seen over the years, from child star to adult addict, the one we saw Sunday night at least added something new to the list: A human being. A troubled, messy, fraught one, to be sure.Above all, troubled. But at least human.Oprah Winfrey, whose name is on the network, asked her at the outset Sunday night what Lohan wanted out of this eight-part ""docu-series,"" which began taping just four days after her release from a Malibu rehab facility last summer -- her sixth such stay over the years.
Lohan at war with Fallon on 'Tonight'
        Watch Lindsay Lohan battle host Jimmy Fallon in an epic game of ""Water War"" -- just the like card game ""War,"" except better (and wetter) -- on the March 6 ""Tonight Show.""
""Just to be honest, and open. Just me.""Lohan has been demonized for so long that it's been easy to lose sight of who that ""me"" is, exactly. But this fascinating new documentary, ""Lindsay,"" produced by Amy Rice, attempted to at least to offer some sort of framework.It began with Lohan literally packing up her life in Los Angeles, lost amid a thousand boxes. ""I need a fresh start, a clean start,"" she says. ""Life can be chaotic. But it's about keeping myself calm in the middle of that, which is what I'm learning to do.""And then came the chaos: Hunting for apartments in Manhattan, returning to her family home in North Merrick, limo rides to who-knows-where-or-why, and a constant swirl of handlers, helpers, and hangers-on. A thrum of stress and anxiety seemed to crowd her in every scene: An argument over some business arrangement, or over a lease, followed by a quick cut to her counselor who says, ""She's trying to create security in an environment that's not very secure.""Get the latest on celebs, TV and more.By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.No kidding.Lohan's been given a lot of shots over the years, but this time it's Oprah who's orchestrating this ""Extreme Home Makeover."" If this strange, frazzled, chaotic, utterly absorbing OWN series accomplishes anything over the next seven weeks, it would -- and hopefully will -- give her a shot at recapturing her humanity, and dignity.Gay is the television critic.

233	"On the premiere episode of Lindsay, the docuseries about Lindsay Lohan's struggle to stay sober and sane fresh out of rehab, Linds moves from Los Angeles to New York City in order to be closer to her family and hopefully reboot her career. She's got her work cut out for her. ""I used to like her,"" is the general consensus from strangers interviewed on the street. Yeah, we all used to. Remember The Parent Trap? Mean Girls? And then the DUIs, thefts, more DUIs, car crashes, lying to the police, and solitary confinement? More what Lindsay is known for now. But coming out of rehab for the sixth (that's not a typo) time, Lindsay feels that this could be her last chance to get back some respect. Well, maybe not respect. But something? A paycheck, maybe?The show starts off with Lindsay apartment hunting -- which is probably the single most stressful undertaking a human being can attempt if the apartment hunting is being done in New York City. Lindsay doesn't have it any better than your average schlub -- in fact, she may have it worse, given her reputation. For who really wants Lindsay as a neighbor? And when her broker breaks the news that the owner of the apartment she settles on wants a $10 million insurance policy -- which she is sure no one will give her -- well, let's just say Lindsay's post-rehab serenity immediately flies out the window. ""Who has that?"" she snaps at the broker. ""I'm not Oprah!""That wasn't Lindsay's only meltdown of the evening. There was her decision not to fly to the Venice Film Festival for the launch of her movie The Canyons. She very rightly concludes that the party atmosphere of a film festival isn't where she should be when she's trying to avoid champagne -- but that doesn't stop the film's director, Paul Schrader, from slagging her off at a press event.""I've been held hostage to a talented but unpredictable actress who said she'd be here today but isn't,"" he grouses. Sheesh, Paul, maybe don't hire Lindsay Lohan next time if it was predictability you wanted.We also get a scene of Lindsay's famous temper when she quits a lingerie shoot rather than take on some dialogue she wasn't prepared for. ""This isn't what I signed up for!"" she hollers, before storming off set and refusing to shoot anything.But behind the diva antics are some real issues -- and we get one real clue where all of this is coming from when Lindsay says in an off-guarded moment, ""I hate when someone makes a promise and breaks that promise. It makes me lose all trust in them. Just like when I was a kid with my dad.""A-ha! And for a moment you feel deeply, truly sorry for Lindsay.But then she spontaneously makes her hapless assistant move all of her things out of her hotel room and into another -- for no particular reason.I look forward to Lindsay turning some of that venom on the person who really deserves it -- her father.Did you watch the show? What did you think about Lindsay's behavior?What Are People Saying About Lindsay?Some are loyal fans...and some know her only from sensationalized tabloid stories. Find out what people are saying about actress Lindsay Lohan and her highly anticipated docuseries. Then, tweet your thoughts using #LindsayOnOWN.

Troubled actress Lindsay Lohan is reportedly set to sign a USD one million deal with HarperCollins to publish a memoir which is based on a diary she wrote during her rehab stint.	The 27-year-old 'Mean Girls' star apparently kept a diary during her rehab stint in 2013 and that would be the base of the book, reported Aceshowbiz.	""It's more or less an autobiography, but she had a minimal number of sample pages. There was initial interest, but everybody backed off. There was concern she wouldn't deliver,"" a source said.	A representative for the publishing house however declined to comment.	Lohan's publicist Tej Herring, meanwhile, said that ""there have been some conversations, but nothing official yet.

235	"11:02: In sum, we need more Oprah. We know there's more Lindsay complaining, Lindsay angst and Lindsay anger. OWN's voice of reason needs to make another appearance, badly. 11:00: To come this season on ""Lindsay"": more problems with shoots. An appearance from her dad, Michael Lohan, and problems with her assistant, Michael. Lindsay on a pole. Lindsay at a doctor's office or hospital(?). Oprah getting angry.""The vultures are waiting to pick your bones if you're not ready,"" Winfrey tells Lindsay. Ruh roh.  10:58: Lindsay is stressed again. She can't get the keys to her new apartment. They want a $10 million dollar insurance policy added to the lease. ""How the hell could anyone have that?"" she tells her broker. ""I'm not Oprah."" She's now been living in a hotel for 36 days. She requests a new room. She hates living in a hotel. It brings her back to a ""crazy"" time in her life, when she was also living in a hotel. She doesn't approve of much lately, except for her sister's walk in a fashion show. 10:48: Lindsay's shooting a short film to promote ... lingerie! And she doesn't like the script. It's not what she expected. It's all very confusing. The models are waiting. She pulls out of the shoot. ""It just wasn't the right timing,"" she says. Compromising her sobriety, apparently. 10:38: Michael, Lindsay's ""sober coach"" thinks it's a bad idea for her to travel, even when business calls. She also isn't too keen on the idea. So she misses at trip to the Venice Film Festival for the premiere of her movie ""Canyons."" She's not settled in a routine yet. They're stuck in a room all day because there's paparazzi outside. She's missing meetings because the photographers would follow her. She feels like a prisoner ""all the time."" Yet she thinks back to the time when a judge wouldn't let her out of actual jail (to make an example of her, Lohan supposes), and she was placed in solitary confinement. The hotel room is probably better.10:33: Lindsay explains the problems with finding an apartment when you're Lindsay Lohan. No one wants Lindsay Lohan in their building, and if they do, they bump up the price, she says. :( :( 10:29: Back at Mama Lohan's house in New York, Lindsay sorts through her belongings. She's moving back in until she finds something more permanent. Mama Lohan looks a bit addled. Lindsay hugs her brother, Cody. They ""have a special bond,"" she says. ""We have so much love in each one of us,"" Lindsay continues. ""It really will be nice when that day comes when there's no more talking and there's only positive things being said, and that will come."" 10:25: Matt, Lindsay's personal assistant, sounds like he could have a show of his own, having assisted Shaun White, Steven Tyler, Sean Astin ... nevermind, Lindsay would probably deliver enough material. 10:18: August 2013. Being back in New York is good for Lindsay, we learn. She's going shopping, trying on hats. Laughing, lighting up a cigarette. 10:11: So far Oprah has given Lohan fair warning: We're both here to get the real you, meaning honest Lindsay, not lying Lindsay. Lohan tells Winfrey she's an addict, specifically an alcohol addict. With the actress just four days out of rehab, Winfrey thinks it's a bad idea for her to go on a trip to Europe for yoga. Lohan thinks better of it and decides to stay in the states. We're reminded that this ""docu-series"" is being directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice. We get a short history of Lindsay, from bright-eyed star of ""The Parent Trap"" to beleaguered actress-addict. 10 p.m.: ""Lindsay.""Will this prove better than Lindsay Lohan's performance in the Lifetime movie ""Liz & Dick?"" And by better, meaning worse, meaning better? Anyhow, this is quite a jarring transition from tonight's premiere of Neil deGrasse-Tyson's ""Cosmos."" A lot of star-gazing, minus the profundity? Whatever the case, whether car-crash TV or an enlightening character study, here's a running chronicle of the events in ""Lindsay,"" a new reality show on OWN, presented by Oprah Winfrey. A whole hour of Lohan, doing what she does. And Oprah, calling her on nonsense, at least once.

no thanks
Not watching
Yep, Lindsay, is a royal eff-up in many ways. But… to her credit,  in front of the world on Oprah she openly admitted being a grand screw up.  Now, she is being brave enough to go public with taking the next step in her recovery and we all get to watch her struggle. She admitted she was an addict. Struggling addicts like Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston and Philip Seymour Hoffman are proof how hard it is to change your life.
Good luck Lindsay! Haters like the below poster named ""Mumra"" who posted just below are so unfortunate.

What time does Lindsay Lohan break her anonymity (again) tonight? Is she coming out an example of recovery? All Good, I want to see it.
I think she's fake, and rude ! It's sad!

won't watch. SHE LIES. EVERY WORD OUT OF HER MOUTH IS A LIE. OPRAH GOT PLAYED.
Why does hollywierd lie to these child stars?  You are so great, blah, blah…. And those that realize that they aren't so great end up in rehab or jail or sometimes both.
it's a bun ch of edited bullshit. they'll make her look abd then they'll redeem her in the end. I'd watch it if I believed that there was an iota of unscripted truth to any of it. But i doubt it. wonder whose paying her her new place? oprah?
She looks to be laughing smugly AT the photog in this pic. She doesn't appear to be a genuinely nice person inside.
The show reminded me of Whitney Houston, when Whitney did the reality show Being Bobby Brown. All the show did was show Whitney’s drug addiction behavior, and was when so many people believed, myself included, it was a matter of time before she’d killed herself with the drugs. It wasn't but a few years later when she did the two-part Oprah interview, and then was dead just three years later. This Lindsay show has way too many similarities, and the fact that Oprah did this is heart breaking.All it focuses on is her getting back to acting. Work isn't going to help her at all. If she doesn't get mental and psychological help and true spirituality, she is going to be dead in a few years, just like Whitney. If human beings don't have a sound mental state they will not live a long or contented life.

She told Extra TV: ""I love that I can call Oprah on the phone, and be like, 'Oprah, can we talk right now?' and she calls me within two minutes. I have to trick her into leaving voicemails, so I can just have Oprah's voicemails ... she's the coolest person ever.""Lindsay, 27, has also filmed a docu-series for Oprah's OWN network which she is keen to stress isn't a reality show, and she says she had no control over what made the final cut. She added: ""I did it because it's not a reality show, it's pretty raw. Obviously it's TV, so things will be edited in certain ways to get ratings, which I can't control, but I do know that my intentions going into it were really pure and really honest.

I have a really strong bond with her where I can call her for advice and she has become someone I can learn from in life.""Lindsay gave an interview to Oprah right after leaving rehab last August and has filmed an eight-part reality show for her TV channel, OWN.However, the 'Mean Girls' star hasn't seen any of the footage, which includes Oprah telling her to ""cut the bulls**t"".She explained: ""I have seen nothing ... it is really interesting as I kept hearing my name [on trailers] and I get really uncomfortable with it.""It is a television show so they want ratings - they picked the first two months after I got back to New York after I had been in treatment.""Oprah, 60, has recently been accused of exploiting Lindsay by signing her up for a reality show, but the actress says the drama seen in the show isn't as it seems.She added: ""I became really spiritual over this past year and I have been trying to find peace and serenity in my life.

Updated: February 12, 2018 @ 2:53 pmMEXICO CITY — Cartel kingpin Nazario Moreno Gonzalez played dead for more than three years, putting on one of the greatest performances in drug-trafficking history.The Mexican government had delivered him the perfect alibi: The head of the vicious cartel based in the western state of Michoacan had been killed in a shootout with federal police, they announced in December 2010.Not only did Moreno change the name of his organization while operating in the shadows, he became more powerful. He expanded from cooking and trafficking methamphetamines to extorting and intimidating everyone across the mineral- and agriculture-rich state, including families and the giant lime, avocado and mining industries.""He was the biggest beneficiary of his anonymity,"" said Alfredo Castillo, the federal commissioner who was sent in January to take back control of the violent state. ""It kept him playing the game.""The game ended early Sunday when Mexican soldiers and marines confronted Moreno in Timbuscatio, a town in the remote mountains. Officials said the troops fired to respond to ""aggression"" as they tried to arrest him.Authorities now had something that was missing the first time: his body.Tomas Zeron, head of the criminal investigation unit for the federal Attorney General's Office, said Moreno's identity had been confirmed by fingerprints.Michoacan residents had long said they had seen Moreno, known as the ""The Craziest One."" They said he carried a Bible and wore priest-like robes as he directed the gunmen of the pseudo-religious cartel he built using a mish-mash of evangelical Protestantism and symbols lifted from history.Support journalism that makes a difference.

243	A fan of Miley Cyrus was arrested last week in Omaha, Nebraska, after he crept into her dressing room and left her a note. Tucker Salvensen, 18, was detained by police on March 6 on suspicion of misdemeanour criminal trespassing after he walked into a restricted area backstage at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha. The teenager, who was allegedly caught on camera committing the crime, messaged Miley on Twitter claiming he'd left a note in her dressing room with his phone number and Twitter handle attached.

244	" Miley Cyrus had a serious creeper moment when a teenage boy-fan snuck into her backstage dressing room. It all went down at her recent Omaha, Nebraska show.

According to a police report, 18-year-old Tucker Salvensen was arrested after he went into the CenturyLink Center and snuck backstage, into the singer's dressing room. What really gave him away was the arena's surveillance video AND the tweet that he posted bragging about the incident.

""@MileyCyrus I snuck in your dressing room today in Omaha there's a note in there for you!!!"" he posted along with a photo of Miley's dressing room.

He was arrested the next day on suspicion of misdemeanor criminal trespassing, and had to miss her concert. ""@MileyCyrus I got arrested and missed the show because I came backstage yesterday when they were setting up #heartbroken,"" he tweeted after his arrest.

As for that ""note"" he left Miley in her room, well according to cops it said, ""I snuck back here I need to meet you. You have helped me so much your music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got broke ... we went through the same thing @ the same time.""

""Miley I love you!!! Please let me meet you,"" he ended it along with his phone number and Twitter name.

Tucker says he was tricked by a truck driver who gave him a VIP pass. He thought it granted him access to the whole building and he had no intention to harm her.

Obsessed Smiler or not...we can't help but wonder, what's with ""fans"" these days? Taylor Swift just had to get a restraining order against a man who was stalking her and threatening her family and so did Selena Gomez.

Miley Cyrus's private backstage area was compromised this week by an overzealous fan.Reports say that the fan, 18-year-old Tucker Salvesen, gained access to a restricted area of the Century Link Center in Omaha, Nebraska.On the night before Cyrus's Thursday (March 6) concert for her current 'Bangerz Tour', Salvesen reportedly received a VIP pass from a driver apart of the tour entourage, allowing him to enter backstage areas without incident.The fan then tracked Cyrus down to her dressing room where, according to a police report, he left a message that read:""I snuck back here I need to meet you. You have helped me so much your music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got brokeâ€¦""We went through the same thing @ (sic) the same timeâ€¦ Miley I love you!!! Please let me meet you.""Salvesen left his Twitter handle and phone number in the note, and was later taken into custody by Omaha police on suspicion of misdemeanor criminal trespassing.This is not the first time a fan has gone to great lengths in order to meet Cyrus.Last year,  a man was arrested for breaking into her California home, and was later given a restraining order.PREVIOUS ARTICLENEXT ARTICLE

253	"Miley CyrusA fan of Miley Cyrus was arrested last week in Omaha, Nebraska, after he crept into her dressing room and left her a note. A Miley Cyrus fan was arrested last week after he allegedly crept into her dressing room in Nebraska. Tucker Salvensen, 18, was detained by police on March 6 on suspicion of misdemeanour criminal trespassing after he walked into a restricted area backstage at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha. The teenager, who was allegedly caught on camera committing the crime, messaged Miley on Twitter claiming he'd left a note in her dressing room with his phone number and Twitter handle attached.According to the police report, Tucker's note to Miley, 21, read: ''I snuck back here I need to meet you. You have helped me so much your music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got broke ... we went through the same thing @ the same time ... Miley I love you!!! Please let me meet you. (sic)''However, Tucker reportedly told law enforcement officers after his arrest that he'd obtained a VIP pass from a truck driver on the tour and thought the ticket gave him access to the entire building. He claims he walked past a number of CenturyLink Center employees on his way to the dressing room and no one stopped to question him, according to KETV NewsWatch 7. CenturyLink Center bosses told police that the VIP passes only allow access to certain areas of the building and do not include the restricted areas where Miley's dressing room was located. Meanwhile, Tucker missed the concert in Omaha due to his arrest, but has already purchased tickets for another show next month.A Miley Cyrus fan was arrested last week after he allegedly crept into her dressing room in Nebraska.

258	"Miley Cyrus was born Destiny Hope Cyrus on November 23, 1992 to country singer Billy Ray Cyrus and wife Tish Cyrus. She earned her nickname, which she later made her legal name, after everyone would call her “Smiley.” The Cyrus family includes younger siblings Braison and Noah, older siblings Brandi and Trace, whom Billy Ray adopted from Tish’ previous relationship, along with a half-brother, Christopher, who was born to Billy Ray’s ex the same year as Cyrus. Country icon Dolly Parton is Cyrus’ godmother.Partially inspired by her father, Cyrus developed an interest in singing and acting early on. Following the debut of “Hannah Montana” in 2006, in which Cyrus played a pop star living a double life, she became one of the Disney Channel’s biggest successes. In 2008, Cyrus scored her first Billboard Top 10 hit with the song “See You Again.” She then slowly began experimenting with a more racy image, as seen on a controversial “Vanity Fair” cover with her father, and in her 2009 Teen Choice Awards performance, during which she pole danced.Following others hits like “7 Things,” “The Climb,” and “Party in the USA,” Cyrus debuted a new sound with her third studio album, “Can’t Be Tamed,” which was released in 2010, the same year she starred in “The Last Song.” The star continued to cause controversy after a leaked video showed her getting high. By the end of 2011, Cyrus was completely separated from the Disney brand.No longer with the Mouse House-approved Hollywood Records, Cyrus signed with RCA and released her “Bangerz” album in 2013, with the hits “We Can’t Stop” and “Wrecking Ball.” At the MTV VMAs that year, she and Robin Thicke caused a huge firestorm with a sexually-suggestive performance, and Cyrus continued to push boundaries with nude photo shoots, outlandish concerts, and an outspoken love for marijuana.Cyrus, however, spent part of 2014 sidelined with serious health woes. She is expected to work on new music in 2015, which she rung in with new boyfriend Patrick Schwarzenegger. He is Cyrus’ first relationship since she and “Last Song” co-star Liam Hemsworth ended their engagement in 2013.February 3rd, 2018January 28th, 2018January 25th, 2018January 15th, 2018January 13th, 2018January 5th, 2018January 2nd, 2018December 30th, 2017December 28th, 2017December 22nd, 2017December 17th, 2017December 14th, 2017December 5th, 2017December 4th, 2017November 29th, 2017« Previous

259	"An overzealous teenage boy was arrested on March 6 after he ended up in Miley Cyrus‘ dressing room backstage at a Nebraska concert and left the twerking pop singer a note, RadarOnline.com is reporting.According to the police report, security cameras showed Tucker Salvensen, 18, walking in restricted areas backstage at the CenturyLink Center the day before the concert.Salvensen basically incriminated himself, tweeting a photo of Cyrus’ dressing room and telling the singer he left her a note.

261	"It was almost an ""Oh My!"" moment in Omaha for Miley Cyrus. A fan, 18, snuck into the superstar's dressing room a day prior to her Bangerz Tour arriving in the Nebraska city.That's scarier than any of the cray cray stuff that takes place while Miley is on the stage, entertaining her Smilers.In all seriousness, the fan, named Tucker Salvesen, gained access to a restricted area of the Century Link Center on Wednesday, March 5. He said he received a pass from a truck driver on the tour, according to local news channel KETV reports.He left a note, begging the singer to meet with him and followed up that old-fashioned transmission with a digital one – he then tweeted to Cyrus, telling her to look for his note and even showed a picture of her dressing room door.According to authorities, Salvesen pledged his love for Cyrus and said that he found the answers to help cure his broken heart in her music and expressed empathy over the fact that they both went through breakups. That sounds somewhat sweet and innocuous, but sneaking in and leaving the note was an act of trespass.The note read as follows, according to reports.""I snuck back here I need to meet you. You have helped me so much your music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got broke ... we went through the same thing @ the same time ... Miley I love you!!! Please let me meet you.""The teen was detained on the day of the concert at the venue and cited on suspicion of trespassing, according to Yahoo!While he didn't sneak into Miley's quarters while she was on site, the fact that he was able to bypass security and gain entry is somewhat frightening. Granted, it was a day in advance, so restrictions may have been lax as opposed to day of, but still.What if he camped out all night waiting for her? Suppose he snuck up on her or left something threatening? You just never know and Cyrus' safety could have been compromised.Subscribe to our newsletter"	Entertainment

You have helped me so much your music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got broke ... we went through the same thing @ the same time ... Miley I love you!!!

That means it, too, could face a public backlash if his administration fails in a country that since 2011 has already risen up in massive protests against two presidents.Two generals close to el-Sissi said the military was well aware of the difficulty in repairing an economy in need of reform even before the 2011 fall of longtime autocrat Hosni Mubark. The two and other government officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.El-Sissi is seen as virtually certain to win, given the wave of public fervor for the military chief since he ousted Egypt's first freely elected president, Islamist Mohammed Morsi.Support journalism that makes a difference.

266	"And the most controversial season of The Bachelor has come to a close.On Monday night, Juan Pablo Galavis' polarizing run as the star of the ABC reality hit ended in quite the dramatic fashion: he didn't propose to Nikki or Clare, a first for the franchise since Brad Womack's first-go-around.But that doesn't mean he ended the two-hour finale alone, as he still wanted to be with one of the ladies. ""I have a ring here in my pocket and I'm not going to use it,"" he told Nikki, the pediatric nurse. ""I'm not 100 percent sure I want to propose to you, but at the same time I'm 100 percent sure I don't want to let you go.""Her response to being offered the final rose, but not an engagement ring? ""Absolutely.""NEWS: Was Juan Pablo ""the worst Bachelor"" ever? Producers thought so!And during the After the Rose ceremony, Nikki and Juan Pablo confirmed that they are still in a relationship, but things were tense as it was revealed that JP has yet to tell Nikki he loves her and Chris Harrison was unable to get him to say it during the awkward hour-long special.But that wasn't the episode's most shocking moment as Clare and Juan Pablo's relationship came to an explosive end, with the Venezuelan Bachelor actually saying, ""I'm glad I didn't pick her,"" after he told her she wasn't The One.And we're surprised Clare even stuck around for the final rose ceremony, as the Venezuelan Bachelor said something to her that ""no woman wants to hear"" that the cameras didn't happen to catch. While Clare wouldn't repeat what he said, she described it as ""offensive"" and ""insulting."" He later than admitted he didn't know her that well and basically said he just liked hooking up with her.But JP was able to convince Clare that he saw a future with her, one that even included children. And Clare was sucked right back in.PHOTOS: Whatever happened to these Bachelor stars?And Clare was mad as hell when Juan Pablo said goodbye to her at the final rose ceremony, calling him out for his ""awful"" behavior.""I saved this moment for the man of my dreams, I thought that as you, I thought I knew what kind of man you were,"" she said, before doling out this doozy: ""I would never want my children having a father like you."" (Sorry, Camila!)One of her parting remarks? ""Don't tell me you loved f--king me,"" she said in a talking head. (We wish she had a mic to drop at the end of that.)And during the After the Rose ceremony, Clare refused to see JP, saying, ""I don't wanna sit here on this couch and get fed anymore BS.""What did you think of The Bachelor finale? Were you surprised by Juan Pablo's pick...and his behavior? Sound off in the comments!PHOTOS: Bachelor and Bachelorette Couples Status Check: Who's Still Together?"	Entertainment
267	"Warning: Major spoilers ahead! If you haven&apos;t seen the March 10 finale of The Bachelor, avert your eyes now.Happily ever after doesn&apos;t look all that happy for Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis and his chosen lady, Nikki Ferrell. The two were reunited in public for the first time since filming the finale on Monday&apos;s After the Final Rose special, and things got pretty awkward pretty quickly. Let&apos;s recap!The ATFR special kicks off with Bachelor host Chris Harrison introducing Juan Pablo&apos;s runner-up, hairstylist Clare Crawley, who is as angry now as she was when Juan Pablo sent her packing in St. Lucia. Clare admits she should have left after the so-called helicopter incident in the finale, but says she ""trusted that there was a man here that wanted what [she] wanted.""

				PHOTOS: Meet Juan Pablo's bachelorettes			
Not so much anymore, though. Clare is done with Juan Pablo&apos;s excuses and explanations — so much so that she declines to sit down with him in front of the live studio audience. ""I don’t want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more BS,"" she explains, adding that she said all she needed to say in St. Lucia.On that note, it&apos;s time to bring out Juan Pablo! The Venezuelan-born Bachelor is unapologetic about giving Clare the boot, telling Chris Harrison he stands by his choice. ""I made the decision that was best for me,"" he says, ""and it is what it is."" Chris gives Juan Pablo a bit of a hard time about his treatment of Clare in the helicopter, but Juan Pablo refuses to take the bait, saying only that he has ""nothing bad"" to say about her, regardless of what she says about him.

				PHOTOS: Bachelor proposals, promise rings, and breakups			
Maybe Nikki will be more talkative? Chris puts Juan Pablo&apos;s chosen lady in the hot seat next, and though she insists she&apos;s ""very happy"" with the Bachelor, she admits he has yet to tell her he loves her. ""He hasn&apos;t ever said those words to you?"" Chris asks her. ""Does that worry you?""Nikki insists it doesn&apos;t, but Chris doesn&apos;t seem convinced. Juan Pablo apparently has a ""big surprise"" planned, though — something he promised an ""ABC executive"" while in St. Lucia.So is this ""big surprise"" a ring? An ""I love you""? None of the above, actually. In fact, Juan Pablo says there is no surprise, and even goes so far as to declare that he and Nikki are ""done with this show"" for good. ""We are so done,"" he says. 

				PHOTOS: Failed reality TV romances			
Asked by Chris how he feels about Nikki, Juan Pablo avoids the L-word, saying only, ""We feel great,"" which prompts Chris to ask again, ""So you love her?""""I&apos;m not going to answer that question. People don&apos;t understand that this is real life…We are happy we had the opportunity,"" he says. ""It&apos;s been tough…It hasn&apos;t been easy. What I&apos;m feeling with Nikki is fantastic.""Fantastic might be an overstatement, but Nikki backs him up. ""I just feel like, time will tell,"" she says. ""This is a real relationship to us.""Tell Us: Do you think Juan Pablo and Nikki will go the distance?

The finale of The Bachelor was just like the entire season: messy, unpredictable and all about Juan Pablo.
The episode began with each of the girls meeting Juan Pablo's family in St. Lucia. Clare is up first and has an interesting conversation with his mom. When Clare asks her if there's anything she should know, Juan Pablo's mom eventually says, ""He is sometimes very rude."" Clare then brings up their disagreement from Vietnam and somehow finds comfort in his mom's reaction to it.
Nikki is next. Having already spent some brief time with Juan Pablo's parents, daughter Camila, and Camila's mom, this time she sits down with his cousin Rodolfo. It's then that Nikki also hears what are potential red flags straight from Rodolfo. ""Juan Pablo ... sometimes when things are getting rough, he walks away [from] the relationship,"" he tells her. ""So how can you deal with that?"" ""I think a relationship with no fighting, [has] no passion ... so I feel like we would fight well,"" she says. 
The Bachelor: Where are they now?
Both girls have their final one-on-one dates. For Clare, it's a romantic helicopter ride. But when they step off the plane, Clare says Juan Pablo made some hurtful, sexual, insulting remarks (that the cameras weren't able to capture.) Clare explains he said something along the lines of, ""I don't know you that well, but I love hooking up with you."" Later in her hotel room, she tries to get Juan Pablo to clarify and as per usual his party line is, ""It's OK."" But Clare finally gets him to say what she wants to hear, that it's more than just the physical with her. ""Tonight I know that he wants me here,"" she says.
Nikki's final date with Juan Pablo begins with a catamaran ride. But, again, he brings up some insecurities Nikki has about their relationship. Later that night, Nikki is still concerned that she's going to lose Juan Pablo. After giving him a photo and a letter expressing her feelings for him, Juan Pablo says goodbye for the final time before she finds out if she's the one.  
The moment of truth finally comes. Clare steps off the boat first, but it's not the outcome she's hoping for. ""You are an unbelievable, amazing woman,"" he tells her. ""I wish the Earth sucked me today because this is the hardest decision ever. I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along...I got to find who I think is best for me and I have to say goodbye to you.""
Is Juan Pablo the worst Bachelor ever? And does it even matter?
But Clare doesn't let it end like that, and instead gives him a piece of her mind.  
""This entire time I've stuck around because I believed in you and the other night on our last date...I needed that reassurance and I gave you the opportunity right then because I was scared to death,"" she says. ""And for you to sit there and tell me that you could see yourself in Sacramento...I  saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you and I thought I knew what kind of man you were. I lost respect for you. What you just made me go through I would never want my children having a father like you.""
""I'm glad I didn't pick her,"" Juan Pablo mumbles after Clare walks away. 
Shortly thereafter, Nikki arrives. ""Just know I love so many things about you,"" Juan Pablo tells her. ""I always have a good time with you, especially at your hometown. I listened to your dad and what he said to me. 'Juan Pablo, if you're going to propose to my daughter you have to be 100 percent sure.'...And that made me think a lot. I have a ring here in my pocket and I'm not going to use it. I'm not 100 percent sure I want to propose to you, but at the same time I'm 100 percent sure I don't want to let you go.""
For the first time since Brad Womack rejected both ladies in the Season 11 finale, there is no proposal. How does Nikki react? ""Absolutely,"" she says when he asks her if she'll accept his final rose.
Did TVGuide.com users agree with Juan Pablo's pick? Not quite. 56 percent of you thought Juan Pablo should choose neither woman! Nikki came in second with 27 percent and Clare last with 17 percent.
What did you think of The Bachelor finale?

269	Whether you’ve seen angry rants about someone named “Juan Pablo” blowing up your Twitter feed or you’ve been roped into a “Bachelor” finale party on Monday night and haven’t seen a single episode, never fear — here’s a quick primer for everyone who is clueless about ABC’s hit reality show. Don’t be ashamed for wondering. It’s natural.“The Bachelor”:It’s one of those shows that everyone skewers, yet many of those very same people can’t stop watching. The finale airs Monday night from 8 to 11 p.m. on ABC. (Yes, three hours.) This is the network’s 18th season of its find-a-soulmate show and it remains a fixture in pop culture, even though ratings aren’t what they used to be. (Seriously — 18 seasons.) So far, two relationships have actually worked out long-term; one was Sean and Catherine, who married about a month ago. (Sister show “The Bachelorette” has had nine seasons, with two weddings and one engagement that still appears to be on. Not bad odds!)The Bachelor:Juan Pablo Galavis, 32, single dad to a sweet four-year-old daughter. Unfortunately: Also the reason this season has been pretty much a disaster, even turning die-hard viewers away. He’s been pretty sleazy, hooking up with more women than is usually acceptable even for a show that is exclusively about hooking up with as many women as possible as a means of finding a soulmate. Two contestants have dramatically quit, and he drove another to tears after a late-night rendezvous in the ocean that he tried to pretend didn’t happen the next day. (And off-camera, there were those anti-gay comments that went viral.) Viewers have not been happy, and the tabloids are filled with stories about how even the show’s producers think Juan Pablo has been the “worst Bachelor ever.”The finalists:And yet, there are two women still vying for his love. Or at least a giant diamond ring. Every finale, one of the tackiest scenes is when “Bachelor”-approved jeweler Neil Lane strolls out with a ginormous case of bling, while the Bachelor contemplates which one is the shiniest and also which of the two women he should propose to after knowing them for a few weeks.Anyway, the contenders are Clare Crawley, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki Ferrell, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City. They do not get along. (Meanwhile, Clare is the one who took that swim in the ocean with Juan Pablo that caused so much controversy — but obviously he wasn’t too upset about it.)The actual finale:Buckle up, because this is a three-hour “journey,” to use one of the show’s favorite words. First, there’s the two-hour show where Juan Pablo will spend a lot of time gazing over the ocean (the finale taped in St. Lucia) and decide which woman he wants to marry, or at least pretend to marry for the purposes of this program. And after an agonizingly long process, both women — decked out in evening dresses — will stroll out to meet Juan Pablo, who will be standing in a forest or something, where he’ll either propose or dump them. It will be magical.Then, the real fireworks start at 10 p.m. with the “After the Final Rose” special. The actual “Bachelor” was filmed months ago, and now everyone (Juan Pablo, the finalists, other rejected contestants) joins together on live television to rehash the season and find out what everyone’s been up to. Translation: Are Juan Pablo and the winner actually still together? Chris Harrison will ask completely invasive questions. It will be awkward, in the most glorious way possible.“The Bachelorette”:Another fun fact about the “After the Final Rose” special: That’s where we learn the identity of next season’s “Bachelorette,” almost always a reject from the previous “Bachelor” season. Rumors are that lawyer Andi Dorfman — the final three contender who stormed off and dumped Juan Pablo in a “shocking” twist a couple weeks ago — will get the honor, and have 25 eligible men competing for her.

271	"One of the most controversial seasons of ""The Bachelor"" came to an end on Monday with Juan Pablo Galavis giving the final rose to Nikki Ferrell.But unlike the previous seasons, a proposal wasn't forthcoming as Galavis said he wasn't sure whether he wanted to marry Ferrell.""I have a ring here in my pocket and I'm not going to use it,"" he told Ferrell. ""I'm not 100 percent sure that I want to propose you, but at the same time, I'm 100 percent sure that I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot. So, Nikki, will you accept my final rose?""Although Ferrell accepted the rose, she seemed to have been expecting a proposal. On various occasions Ferrell had professed her love for Galavis, but he has never returned the sentiment.Is marriage on the cards for Ferrell and Galavis? Only time will tell.Meanwhile, Clare Crawley left with a heavy heart saying Galavis was not the man she was expecting.When the single dad approached Crawley and said that he would have to send her home, she was livid and said that she stuck around because she believed in him.""I lost respect for you ... I thought I knew what kind of man you were. But what you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you,"" Crawley said before walking away.And Galavis' response? ""Whew, I'm glad I didn't pick her.""Referring to an off-camera moment the couple had, Clare said that she gave Galavis another chance to come closer when he said he doesn't know her at all. But it ended badly when he took her on a helicopter date and insulted her.An insider told Wetpaint that ""Clare asked Juan Pablo, ""Just tell me you love me,"" knowing that Galavis may be hesitant to declare his love on camera. And he said, ""I really loved f—ing you.""Back in the studio live after the final rose segment, both Galavis and Ferrell looked awkward and refused to speak about their relationship.This was unlike the previous seasons when the couple expressed their relief at being able to flaunt their relationship after three months of hiding.Ferrell was also not wearing an engagement ring, indicating that their relationship had not proceeded further.The situation became even more awkward when ""The Bachelor"" host Chris Harrison asked Galavis if he loved Ferrell.""I'm not going to answer that question,"" Galavis said. ""People don't understand this is real life. We're very happy and we are so done with the show.""""So….you're not gonna tell us you love her?"" a confused Harrison asks. ""This is what this show is about. We're on this journey with you. This is your time to shine. You can express your feelings.""But the couple remained evasive and explained that although they have made plans for the future, they would not divulge the details.The show ended with Harrison announcing Andi Dorfman as the next Bachelorette.The new season of ""The Bachelorette"" will premiere on 19 May."	Entertainment
272	"Thank God our love affair with Juan Pablo ends tonight. He will go down in infamy as the worst Bachelor/person to ever exist on this earth, and I am so thoroughly excited for Nikki to break up with him and do a tell-all Us Magazine interview revealing his weirdest, most disgusting habits. I'll bet he sucks on his own toes. Anyway, this is the grand finale, through deconstructed quotes.""The controversy centering around Juan Pablo has been unlike anything we have ever seen before on The Bachelor.""Who said it: Chris Harrison
Why he said it: What Chris means here is there was controversy surrounding Juan Pablo's comments on homosexuality and the mentally handicapped, on top of the controversy caused by his sad, stupid self.""Today i'm gonna keep an eye on Claire to see how she interacts and how she fits into my family.""Who said it: Juan Pablo to the cameras
Why he said it: You know when awful guys know a girl is not for them but are too driven by their dick and sleep with them anyway and then start to resent them, when really it's them resenting themselves? This is what Juan Pablo's relationship with Clare is like.""I love love love family.""Who said it: Clare-bear :(
Why she said it: Notice how there is no possessive pronoun before the word ""family"" here and it is just ""family."" Clare just loves family the way kids love snacks and sprinklers and when their dads spin them around. :(""You got your ears pierced?"" *feigns surprise* I love that!""

Who said it: Claire talking to Camila :\
Why she said it: Because she has no clue how to talk to kids I don't think.

""He's hyperactive. Super hyperactive.""

Who said it: JP's mom to Clare
Why she said it: Great question. This is the kind of thing you say about a a fifth grader-- to their new babysitter, not to somebody who might end up marrying your son.
""What do you feel about your communication about Juan Pablo?"" - Juan Pablo's mom""I love it."" - ClaireWhy this happened: Wish I could explain this but instead I'll just choke-laugh it out over here.""I could 1000% see myself as a part of Juan Pablo's family forever.""Who said it: Who do you think :( (Clare)
Why she said it: Because homegirl is s0o0o clueless it's beginning to get sad :( Notice how I've been sad facing all over the place :( :(""Latinos are passion as hell.""Who said it: That guy in Juan Pablo's family. Either his cousin or his brother or his best friend or both.
Why he said it: It's true, latinos are ""passion as hell."" Juan Pablo, however, is not.""I could not appreciate everything I am experiencing this much if he wasn't next to me.""
Who said it: Clare
Why she said it: This is just a depressing quote and I'm gonna move on right now.""Maybe he's not the man that he thought he was. I am so confused right now and I really don't know what to do next.""Who said it: CLARE
Why she said it: Juan Pablo said something nasty to Clare when there were no cameras-- something along the lines of ""I don't even know you that well but I really like f%&#ing you"" I'm going to guess-- and instead of not realizing how sleazy it is Clare STANDS UP FOR HERSELF and realizes that something isn't right.""So that's why you didn't give me a kiss? Okay.""Who said it: JP, smugly, to Clare when she invites him over the night before the decision and she decides not to kiss him at the door
Why he said it: Cuz he's a f$*#ing dick.""I have much more to offer a relationship than just [physical attraction.]""Who said it: Clare, who is suddenly not a robot!!!
Why she said it: A lightbulb went off?""Honestly do I see myself with you? Yeah, I could see myself with you, sure.""Who said it: JP to Clare, as unconvincingly as it sounds.
Why he said it: See two above^""It was painful to watch. I could hear the collective sigh in here as she was starting to give in.""Who said it: Sean, The Bachelor from last season who is at the live show tonight. Sean seems mad cool guys, I'm pissed I didn't watch his season.
Why he said it: Cuz he's a real cool dude, apparently""Every day I want something to happen that makes me feel better about that person.""Who said it: The indecisive idiot that is Juan Pablo
Why he said it: Well, the two girls he was really into dumped him, and now he's left with two girls he's not psyched on. So hopefully some love potion can drop from the sky for him so he can make some sort of decision. Yeesh.""It has to be me. He can't have what he has with me with anyone else.""Who said it: Nikki
Why she said it: Sometimes I wonder if Nikki just wants to beat Clare, not marry Juan Pablo.""Like I know my dad would be proud that I've opened myself up.""Who said it: Clare, as she walks toward JP :(
Why she said it: Alsakjdal;ksjdal;ksjalkdjs""When you came out of the limo with the belly- I thought look at her...""
Who said it: JP
Why he said it: Ohhh right. I had forgotten how Clare was the one who was wearing a fake baby bump on the first episode. *Cringes*""I wish the earth sucked me today because this is the hardest decision ever.""Who said it: Juan Pablo the baby
Why he said it: Because he is a hyperactive baby who can't make a decision to save his life""This entire time I stuck around because I believed in you.""Who said it: CLAREEEEEEEE

273	It may have taken me the entire season to figure out that I really hated Juan Pablo, but also to realize who Clare Crawley looks like.Clare Crawley looks like…But I finally figured it out.

274	"And with one final ""ess OK,"" Juan Pablo's season of The Bachelor has come to an end. The 32-year-old Venezuelan soccer player — who managed to get in trouble every step of the way — chose to give his last rose to Nikki Ferrell, 23, from Kansas City, MO, after a twisty finale that had all but indicated the he would choose Clare. Juan Pablo had almost scared Clare off completely by telling her something disrespectful and ""sexual"" while the audio wasn't hooked up. He reassured her the next day that he really liked her and wanted kids with her in the oddly specific time period of one year and two months. Then he sent her home. To everyone's delight, she did not go quietly into that sunny beach. ""What you just made me go through, I would never want my kids to have a father like you,"" she said. Once she had walked out of earshot, Juan Pablo muttered, ""Wow, I'm glad I didn't pick her."" Cue the entire audience's boos.Nikki seemed overjoyed to get the final rose, though Juan Pablo wouldn't say he was in love with her, nor would he give her the ring in his pocket. Even at the after show, Juan Pablo still refused to say he was in love with Nikki. I'm curious what you think of the episode — vote and sound off below.

275	"TrendingAs we’ve seen many times before, Juan Pablo Galavis does not like to lose fights, so after he sent Clare Crawley home and she dissed him, he decided to return the favor by getting in one last nasty comment as she left. Talk about egotistical!It’s hard enough to lose any competition, but when it’s a competition like The Bachelor where your heart is on the line, losing can be devastating.[hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″]






[hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]It’s been so clear throughout the season, and especially during the March 10 finale, just how much Juan Pablo meant to Clare. So to see him diss her after sending her home just seemed wrong.Clare may have given him some ammo when she said she would never want someone like him to be the father of her children, but he had just turned her down on live television so from where we’re standing, she had the right to make that comment.But instead of being chivalrous and keeping quiet during the After the Final Rose special, Juan Pablo just had to diss Clare. “I’m glad I didn’t pick her,” he blurted out for all of the world to hear. Unbelievable!This whole exchange, including Clare’s diss, was shocking. But Clare admitted that she had a gut feeling that Juan Pablo wasn’t the one, and that’s why she called him into her room to talk the night before the ceremony.Though we don’t know for sure what was said during their infamous helicopter ride, we do know it really rubbed Clare the wrong way. From that moment, we really think she knew that Juan Pablo was not the man for her.What did YOU think of the show, HollywoodLifers? Do you think it was cruel of Juan Pablo to diss Clare? Let us know!— India Irving"	Entertainment
276	"TrendingWe’re sure everyone from Clare Crawley to Chris Harrison would have enjoyed telling off Juan Pablo Galavis during The Bachelor‘s After the Final Rose special on March 10. In the end, it was Bachelor alum Catherine Giudici who slammed Juan Pablo — and we could be happier about her bold diss!Juan Pablo was tight-lipped to the point of being disrespectful during the After the Final Rose special, refusing to open up about his feelings for Nikki or any of their plans for the future. Whenever Chris asked him a question, Juan Pablo replied by saying that the world should respect his and Nikki’s privacy now that the show is over.






[hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″][hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]The most infuriating part about all of this was that Juan Pablo knew exactly what he was signing up for when he agreed to be the next Bachelor. Chris said as much, but since he was the host he had to hold back a bit. Catherine, however, did not!She and her husband, fellow Bachelor alum Sean Lowe, were in attendance for the show and they seemed just as disgusted by Juan’s bad behavior as the rest of us!Catherine told Juan he was dissing The Bachelor and the show’s entire process, not to mention Nikki, by not proposing to her and revealing his true feelings during After the Final Rose. “Don’t slap the hand that fed you,” she tells Juan Pablo. Of course, this phrase was lost on Juan Pablo, but thankfully Chris made sure he got the message.Sean, ever the gentleman, just couldn’t understand how Juan Pablo could humiliate the woman who won his heart by refusing to profess his love for her on the show. Sean tells Juan Pablo that he fell madly in love with Catherine when they were on The Bachelor, and once he knew she was the one, he didn’t hold back.“The moment I knew, I could not wait to tell her that,” Sean says. How sweet! Now that’s the kind of Bachelor we like to see. Juan Pablo could definitely take a few pointers from Sean!So HollywoodLifers, are YOU glad Catherine and Sean told Juan Pablo off?

277	"Blake Lively Lost 61 Pounds of Baby Weight & Reveals the Results In a New Photo!Gigi Hadid Slams Body Shamers & Weight Critics: 'Learn More Empathy for Others''Peter Rabbit' Filmmakers Apologize Over That Very Controversial SceneA Burglar Tried to Rob Joe Jonas, But...SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU DON’T WANT TO KNOW THE RESULTS!The eighteenth season of The Bachelor has just wrapped up and Juan Pablo Galavis has given out his final rose!His final two women were hairstylist Clare Crawley and nurse Nikki Ferrell in a season full of controversy with Juan Pablo‘s anti-gay comments and the recent use of the word retard on Twitter.In case you didn’t know, Juan Pablo‘s journey started as a contestant on the previous season of The Bachelorette, on which he was sent home by Desiree Hartsock in the early rounds of the show.Click inside to find out who received the final rose on The Bachelor finale…After dumping her at the final rose ceremony, Clare told Juan Pablo that she “would never want my children having a father like you.” He had told her the last night he had seen her that he could see himself living in Sacramento with her and having children together. She felt disrespected that he would say those things if he wasn’t planning on choosing her. Once Clare walked away, Juan Pablo said to himself “I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”When Nikki came to the rose ceremony, Juan Pablo told her that he does not want to let her go, but that he is not ready to propose. He asked her to accept his final rose, and she accepted.I’m disappointed in Nikki, she wanted the stars and she settled for a pebble. She liked him way more than he liked her. This guy is to self absorbed, if he cared he would have gotten to know the girls on a personal level rather than a physical one. The guy can’t make a commitment because he doesn’t really know what he wants.@KC Native: I don’t understand what everyones (almost everyone)problem is!!Everybody DOES NOT fall in love in 4 months.Most of the time…. Love does take time.I’m all in for you Jaun Pablo.Take ur time,enjoy it and be sure….there are other people involved and he is having respect for them.Divorce especially with children is a TERRIBLE thing!!!I don’t understand what everyone’s (almost everyone) problem is!!EVERYBODY does not fall in Love in 4 months.Most of the time…. Love does take time.I’m all in for you Jaun Pablo and Nikki.Take your time,enjoy it and let that moment happen when it’s suppose to.There are other people involved and he is having respect for them.DIVORCE especially with children is a terrible thing!!  Surely you don’t want him to say he’s “In Love” when he’s not yet.You all would have a field day with that and you would like him even less.So you can’t have it both ways!@Joni James:  I do understand that most people, especially those who have fallen in love before, in 4 months. The problem is being in love with someone but they don’t reciprocate to the same level. Nikki stated SHE was in love with Juan Pablo, if she had come out and said she really cared for him but agreed she wasn’t sure that she was actually in love yet then I could understand. But when one person declares they love another, and the other simply states your special but I don’t know that I love you means they are in different stages. Its extremely risky for the one who has such strong feelings. I do hope Nikki doesn’t get her heart broken by putting it out there but not having Juan put his out there to.I think Juan Pablo was the most real bachelor they have had, and I think Chris Harrison was rude and inappropriate in the way he talked to Juan Pablo and the comments  he made afterwards.  The ridiculous way Chris kept intimating something was wrong with Juan because he didn’t fall in love in three or four months is ludicrous, as is borne out by all the “successes” The Bachelor has had leading to marriage.  Frankly, I found Harrison so distasteful, especially the “shower” comment, that right now I’m considering finding a replacement for the show.Juan Pablo must have insulted Chris’s manhood for him to make such an ass out of himself.  Maybe The Bachelor should clean house.Juan Pablo publicly embarrassed Nikki and she played it off like it wasn’t a big deal. If a man cannot claim his love for you in front of others, there is no hope in the relationship. Her fake smiles and laughs said it all. Nikki was trying so hard to make it seem like everything was fine, but any woman knows that it definitely is not. God help her and God help Juan Pablo and his narcissism. Nikki is someone to truly pray for if she sticks by this man’ side. No relationship is perfect, but this “relationship” is a big sham.Wow, talking about turning the tables….Clare turned out to be strong and respected for the way she handled herself in the end, and Nikki turned out to be completely blind when it comes to this guy.  He told Clare he wanted to f**k her, then turns around and gives Nikki the final rose a day later.  There were so many red flags, and she’s in La La Land.  He’s been  photographed (and very chummy with) other women in the last few weeks, but she seems oblivious.  Ha ha on her for being such a moron.@Charlene wisniewski:   Maybe you should just stop watching the show, since you obviously take it so seriously.   Alot of it is made up!!! Surprise!!Worst ABC Bachelor Juan Pablo !! it so disappointing for viewers to see such disgusting disrespect to women by this so call most eligible bachelor.  He just playing with the network to get free trips and finally say I like you a lot !,, wow… That is crazy… More crazy and disappointing is spineless Nikki.  Excepts thus crazy I like you and excuse about her dad. Wow and. She is educated wow!!! Dumb as a door nail,,,I do think Nikki saw this more as a competition with Clare than the fact she was giving up her self respect to win the affection of a player. I do agree that this show is staged and the fact is most people can’t fall in love in this type of situation where one partner holds all the cards in the game. I could never go on this show unless I just wanted publicity. I realize that guys I have dated were dating other women but the ironic part was when I started to also date around it would piss the other guy off and they saw it more like a competition rather than truly finding someone to love. I only watched this show because a fellow Kansas citian was in it, I won’t be watching it again. Love isn’t found on a TV show, its found living a life and being involved.Wow.  Nicki is going to settle for this?? He’s a player and has no intentions of marrying ANYBODY. I would have shoved that rose up his a**!Ok to all those people saying juan Pablo did the right thing by not proposing and being honest, thats not why 95% of america hates him! He doesnt have to love nikki, no one is forcing him to love her. Its the fact that he won’t admit that he doesn’t love her but rather talk in circles. He wants everything to be private yet you signed up for a show on primetime…What a genius! His language barrier defense was so overplayed. In one episode he said ” I’m, How you say, Happy? like please! He wasn’t in this for the right reasons and it showed!Congratulations! Juan Pablo found a girl dumber and more shallow than himself. Nikki is a fool and too ditsy to know it. She WON, she WON, she WON! Psssst…..Nikki…JP is 1) a man, 2) an athlete 3) a player, 4) a total BSer. You are the flavor of the month and it wont last much longer than that. JP loves HIMSELF, period! Clare is the true winner and I hope she is the next Bachelorette!Get a grip people.  You guys do realize he has been divorced before and has a child.  He does not have to get married yet, let him be.  And why the hostility over him not telling her he loves her.  So what if she said she loves him.  Listen in every relationship one person loves the other more then the other loves them.  So right now Niki loves him, ok.  Why does he have to say it if he is not there yet.  Everyone either wanted him to say he loves her which would have been a lie, or tell her that he does not love her and that would have been really mean.  He did not lie, he did not hurt Nikki’s feelings so chill out.  Most things are not a fairy tale and I am glad that this guy showed us that.I think Nikki is a beautiful young woman. She’s educated and smart but the way Juan  Pablo treats her and she just lets him get away with it is not to smart. He doesn’t know what he wants and he’s not going to commit to anyone bc he’s a player and he doesn’t think about how he treats woman bc he’s so self absorbed. I think the best thing Nikki could do is WAKE UP and run as fast as she can. I think there is someone out there that would have respect for her and treat her like a lady not just a notch in his belt. Juan Pablo will use her but not commit to her.@Jenna: yes it’s true he’s been divorced and has a child but he knew this going into this…… If he was not ready to fall in love and find a woman who could possible be his wife he should of stayed home and not involve a woman in his life. I think Nikki deserve better than what he willing to give which is notting.   Just saying@KC Native: I couldn’t agree with you more she needs to wake up.@KC Native: True,True,True@Blythe:  I like what you had to say I hope Nikki doesn’t get hurt but I think she’s already feeling the pain. I don’t think Juan Pablo can stop thinking about his self long enough to consider someone else and there feelingsit doesn’t matter who he picked because it won’t last anyway.@…: and u people complaining about Juan aren’t taking the show seriously? Please.I think Juan Pablo is sincere in someway with Nikki. He introduced her to his daughter, that was the giveaway that she was the one he was interested in. The reality of falling in love in four months is crazy. Fondnesss, not complete love. Trust and respect are earned. Nikki is young and still in fairytale stage of life. Primce charming syndrome and probably in love with thought of being in love or lust. She is also a model on the side besides nursing. Great publicity. I think he wants to leave the player side open for him. So if he declared he LOVES Nikki, his HONESTY slogan would not work if he still wants to persue other comtestants he may want to play with.@Mary:   He’s never been married.@Ugonna Wosu:   As for “you people,”  Chris was NOT the problem, JP was.  Duh.No. Chris was the problem. He wad unprofessional. And as for Clare, she said that he said “I enjoy f—ing you”, not “I want to sleep with you”. That implies that she did sleep with him. I read that she went to his room, so if that’s true and if she did sleep with him, then how could she expect anything else? I’m not saying what he supposedly said is ok, but you can’t expect respect when you gave the whole cow for free instead of just the milk.This beady eyes uneducated self-centre rude disrespectful to women looser who is stil live in his mum Dad apartment with his daughter is a big ass looser… I would not date him even if he beg me with not just one but 2 dozen rosed.I dislike Juan Pablo but he is very misunderstood. He clearly did not understand the game of The Bachelor and was quite honest with Nikki, who obviously accepted he does not love her in the same way she “loves” him. How can she? She’s known him on a TV show for 2 months and then secretly, in two different cities, for another 2. This is nowhere near what love entails. It could not be and all the other Bachelors are lying if they say they “loved” their choice so soon in the show. One day you are confused about who to choose and then 2 days later you are 100% sure (Sean)? Really? I found Juan Pablo totally realistic. yes, he an arse, and a bad “Bachelor” – but thats because he didn’t give the fans and Harrison the happy ending they wanted and watched for.@KC Native:  Ya think??? She talked about “winning,” and “I don’t want to lose this.”  She showed her nasty side with Clare, and I think she wanted to win out over her.  I never liked Nikki and her awful hair and clothes… she was phony and unemotional.  She always gave everyone the answers they wanted to hear.  Last night, she looked  like a robot.  Maybe she gets what she deserves.I couldn’t stand this Bachelor, but at least he didn’t fake love or propose for the sake of a reality show.  Let’s see what happens now that they have time to be in a real relationship.  I suspect Nikki will figure him out very quickly, and JP will forever be a dumb Romeo.@Ugonna Wosu:   Because it’s a very vulgar thing to say, that’s why.  I’m sure Nikki slept with him, too, maybe Andi.  Chris was not the problem, JP was very difficult from the beginning.@Pawnee: And unfortunately, Clare used her prissy faced looks and body to entice him, and then cried foul when he decided she wasn’t it for him.@Duh: no, if she indeed slept with him, I don’t know where she would get off finding it vulgar. She sold herself short, and shouldn’t be surprised. Regardless of whether or not the other girls “did it too”, that doesn’t matter, imo.@Maria: exactly. And she was so offended, yet she was looking forward to winning the show. lol. The only reason she “stood up for herself” is cause she got dumped. Am I really supposed to applaud that? I also think its ridiculous to insist he declare his love for someone he doesn’t know.@What an arrogant C unt:   FYI: The “c” word is vulgar in the U.S., just like his comments to Clare…and learn how to spell.@Maria:   ALL of the women did, dummy.  You sound sexist.@Ugonna Wosu:   It’s VERY vulgar to say that to a woman…maybe you just have low self esteem.@Ugonna Wosu:   She stood up for herself, because he lead her on, and she said that.  Nikki is boring and phony, and looked like an idiot sitting with him last night.  Good for Clare.  Gee, he’s such a catch.@MMM: no, she was waiting to win the Bachelor and get the guy up until then. Sorry.@Yuck:  not when she put herself in that position. And now you’re trying to talk about me? Really? Its not like I called you on being an idiot who can’t understand the concept of giving away the cow. I didn’t, until now that you insulted me. lol. Oh well.Interesting that we were promised a surprise from JP last night; suddenly, no surprise.  Clearly, Juan Pablo was furious about the way he’s been depicted (the “honesty” of it all!!) and whatever his surprise was going to be, he reneged on it which infuriated Harrison. But what did the show expect from a proud South American?  The producers of the show should have known better than to chose him in the first place.Gotta give them credit, no matter what.   How many people have stood up at the end professed this love and they are now engaged and going to be happy forever.  Only to find out forever maybe lasts a few months, once the camera’s and lights are off and gone so is that love.  These two are real in a way, they don’t know where it will go but they want to take it to the next level on there own in there own way.  Good luck looking forward to see what happens.   Also as far as Clare she was pushing everything I thought she got was she deserved.     Do I like the new bachelorette,   time will tell,  Juan Pablo you gave them what they wanted HIGH RATINGS.You know the tabloids are gonna be watching him and her like hawks on their prey. Everyone is going to want to see if being “honest” was the real reason he was so quiet about the relationship. I do applaud Claire for sticking up for herself, the others that he rejected didn’t go off on him and tell them what they thought of him. They were still star struck with his latin good looks and charm. At least Claire saw him for who he was. He probably didn’t pick her because she didn’t sleep with him the night before. He obviously was attracted to her from the beginning. Sadly I think Nikki was so into the “competition” part that she let it blind her to the truth. Even after the fantasy dates all of them had red flags being thrown in their face, only Andi had the guts to say it to his face before she heard his narcissistic choice.This is ridiculous. The only class people in this show have been Juan Pablo and Nikki. Claire was a playing bitch from the beginning and showed that at the end. Juan may be self absorbed but keeps to his guns and believes what he thinks and says. Finally someone who can say this show is ridiculous as how can go out with 27 people in 10 weeks and fall in love. How many of the previous couples are still together?
He is doing what is best for him and his daughter, and I think that Nikki understands this and will work with this, after all that is her profession.
The idiot of the show was the host, trying to put words into  Juan s mouth, when Juan was trying to keep his private life to himself. Yes he did agree to be on the show and I totally agree that this commitment ended on the last show, so, if you did not see it, let them be as it is obvious that they are in love and this is a personal thing.This had to be one of the most arrogant bachelors I have ever watched. This guy was ugly no figure dressed ugly when taking them out, even when he went to meet their parents. Man were these your for real dumb blondes all of them even if they weren’t blond. How could they fall for such anu ugly moron.Clare at the end had enough smarts to walk away. had they all been smart they would have all walked away right at the start. Whya are women so stupid to go on these programs & be so humiliated, not very many of them were even decent to look at. I guess it is a proven factor there aren’t many decent & good looking men around when they let fools like him make them look like complete idiots.I couldn’t stand watching this b@stard on the Bachelor.
Why isn’t he doing DWTS? That’s coz he’s a complete jerk!
Isn’t he sign a contract with ABC? with free trips.. Free meals.. FREE EVRYTHING!!
Nobody like this little close-eyed Idiot.
It’s time to sink back to your mamacita and papa apartment you moron!!!
Wang Piglo Worst bachelor ever!!!!!!@Clare: Wow!!… I’m astounded by the accuracy of the insight people are expressing about these relationships … there must be something extra special about the coverage over there in the states. Australia’s franchise doesn’t have a ‘proposal’ event at the end of the show… why would you? You’re chasing 25 members of the opposite sex – on camera only – if you’re lucky for 2 maybe 3 one on one dates… get real.
Chris Harrison is an arse, show some respect, not to burst your bubble Sean… if you chase the limelight, get married on camera, show up at every other televised Bachelor event, of course it wont end anytime soon… trust me we’ll tire of you. Seems to be a distinct lack of empathy and respect for diversity of character in people and an astonishing desire to judge on the word of some seemingly very insecure individuals."	Entertainment
278	"“The Bachelor” premiered on March, 25, 2002 on ABC, with the premise of 25 women competing for the heart of one man. Hosted by Chris Harrison, the show has The Bachelor go on a series of dates with groups of women, as well as on individual dates, all in the hope of finding a wife. The elimination process consists of a rose ceremony, in which roses are handed out to the women who The Bachelor chooses to keep on the show. Those who don’t receives flowers at each week’s “rose ceremony” are sent home. At the end of each season, “The Bachelor” must choose between two women, with the expectation that he’ll propose to one of them.The contestants live in “Villa De La Vina,” a mansion in Agoura Hills, California, for the first two weeks of filming. The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.  The first “Bachelor” was Alex Michel. At the end of the first season, Michel had to chose between Amanda Marsh and Trista Rehn, better known now as Trista Sutter. Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.” The series has featured a slew of hunky and memorable Bachelors over the years including, Andrew Firestone, Lorenzo Borghese, Charlie O’Connell, Bob Guiney, Brad Womack, Jason Mesnick, Jake Pavelka, Sean Lowe, Juan Pablo Galavis and Ben Higgins. It has has also spawned three spin-off series on ABC. “The Bachelorette” debuted in January 2003 with Rehn as its inaugural star. “Bachelor Pad,” where previous contestants competed for a cash prize of $250,000, debuted on August 9, 2010. And “Bachelor in Paradise,” which also features previous contestants from both “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in an exotic locale, first aired on August 4, 2014.Though “The Bachelor” has earned a reputation for not having the relationships work out, there have been a few high-profile weddings during its run. Rehn, Mesnick, Hebert, and Lowe have all had weddings specials air on ABC.February 5th, 2018January 29th, 2018January 22nd, 2018January 15th, 2018January 8th, 2018January 2nd, 2018January 1st, 2018January 1st, 2018September 7th, 2017August 31st, 2017August 25th, 2017August 25th, 2017June 15th, 2017May 15th, 2017March 28th, 2017« Previous

          18View  commentsTV’s most controversial Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis finally picks his girl - but refuses to propose, saying nothing more romantic than: ‘I like you a lot.’Juan Pablo handed his final rose to beautiful Nikki Ferrell, telling her, ‘I don’t want to let you go’ but also admitting: ‘I’m not 100 per cent sure that I want to propose to you.’And now, four months later, the 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Missouri has admitted her beau has STILL not told her he loves her - with Juan Pablo squirming in his seat as he repeatedly refused to say the L-word when put on the spot during the live after-show interview.'I have a ring here in my pocket... but I’m not gonna use it': The shock finale of ABC's The Bachelor on Monday night saw Nikki Ferrell chosen by Juan Pablo Galavis... but not to be his wife Sealed with a kiss: Unfortunately for Nikki, that was all she was getting ‘I like you a lot. Will you accept my final rose?’ Nikki didn't get quite the proposal she was hoping for, with Juan Pablo only offering a rose at the conclusion of the journey to find loveThe finale to the reality TV show sealed its place as the most controversial season yet, with the former professional football player easily being the most hated Bachelor to date.Host Chris Harrison admitted: ‘Twelve years I’ve been doing this - this is a Bachelor first, easily.‘The controversy surrounding Juan Pablo is unlike anything we’ve seen on this show before.’Perhaps the most amazing part was that he got either girl to stick around to accept a rose, having left BOTH of the final two contestants in tears on their final dates because of his behaviour.Back in the box: While Juan Pablo went through the motions in choosing a dazzling Neil Lane diamond engagement ring, he opted not to present it to either woman With this ring... Nikki seemed to understand why her beau chose not to present her with the ring, however, she admitted during the After The Final Rose show that he still wasn't able to tell her he loves her, which hurt moreNikki wept as she said goodbye having 
confessed her love - with the handsome Bachelor leaving her in 
uncomfortable silence as he merely said: ‘Thank you.’But rejected finalist Clare Crawley, 32, was even more devastated as he took their one private moment on their final date to tell her he ‘loved f***ing’ her on an earlier date.He won her over by hinting at marriage and children, getting her to stay on until the end - only to be rejected.A let down? The pretty pediatric nurse beamed from ear to ear at 'winning' the competition, though she walked away without the reciprocation of love that she - and everyone else - had anticipated 'I can’t imagine spending my life without you': Nikki put her heart on the line once more, to which Juan Pablo in return offered nothing stronger than a 'thank you'She then managed to get her own ‘closure’, pushing him away when he went in for a hug - and getting to angrily speak her mind.‘I’ve lost respect for you,’ the 
hairdresser from Sacramento, California told him, adding that he was 
‘not the man I thought you were’.‘What
 you just made me go through - I would never want my children having a 
father like you,’ she told him, getting cheers from the audience 
watching in the studio.‘I’ve lost respect for you': Runner-up Clare Crawley didn't mince her words as she confronted Juan Pablo with a few home truths about his behaviour towards her after she was unceremoniously dumped  'That is not a man': The jilted beauty told the Bachelor it was 'easy to just kiss and show your feelings' before adding that he is 'not the man I thought you were' Letting
 it all out: The 32-year-old was in floods of tears as she addressed the
 cameras after giving Juan Pablo a much-needed piece of her mind She later added: ‘It’s easy to just 
kiss and show your feelings. But don’t tell me you loved f***ing me - 
don’t tell me that. That is not a man.’Neither
 girl could have been caught by complete surprise, however, with Juan 
Pablo cementing his behaviour with the women throughout the season.And
 even his family seemed keen to warn the girls off when they met them, 
telling them both that Juan Pablo is rude, selfish and even possibly 
boring as he spends all his time at home watching TV.But their warnings did not put either of the love-blind woman. Opening up: Juan Pablo read Nikki's love letter out aloud, before leaving her reeling at his reaction Heartbroken: The 26-year-old was left devastated when her 'boyfriend' responded to her declaration of love on their final date night together with yet another non-committal 'thank you''I feel like we have something special': After he left, the blonde broke down in tears and began questioning whether or not their was a future for their relationship after all ‘I
 could one thousand per cent see myself a part of Juan Pablo’s family 
forever,’ Clare said after meeting his nearest and dearest - especially 
after seeing him with his daughter, Camila.‘How adorable was Juan Pablo with his
 daughter? So hot,’ she said excitedly. ‘I feel like it makes him that 
much sexier. It melted my heart because she loves him to death.’Nikki,
 meanwhile, said: ‘After today with Juan Pablo’s family, I am more 
confidant that this is the guy for me and, you know, in a few days he’s 
going to be down on one knee.‘It’s going to be so awesome. I want that so bad.’Tough decision? The former pro football player looked deep in thought as he pondered over the final rose The calm before the storm: Clare was full of expectation as host Chris Harrison accompanied her to the picturesque setting of what she had hoped would be her wedding proposal Initially on her final date - a helicopter ride across beautiful scenery in Saint Lucia - Clare said she was ‘on cloud nine’.But
 that soon changed when they had a private moment with no cameras or 
microphones - and Juan Pablo said things that left her in tears.‘Juan
 Pablo leaned over and whispered something to me,’ Clare recalled. ‘But 
what I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what 
came out of his mouth. And I’m just... shocked.’Fighting back tears, she said: ‘I 
don't have words for it, how I feel right now. He chose to tell me 
something that no woman wants to hear. That he really doesn't know me 
and some sexual thing I don't want to repeat. A lot to think about: Both Nikki (left) and Clare appeared pensive as they made their way by boat to their tropical destination, where their Prince Charming awaited them ‘The controversy surrounding Juan Pablo is unlike anything we’ve seen on this show before': The 32-year-old has been dubbed the most hated bachelor in the history of the show following his season full of obnoxious and often baffling behaviour  ‘It was insulting, it was offensive and it just made me feel awful.‘I’m not just an object. Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he’s not the man I thought he was.’She added: ‘He chooses not to say something romantic, but that he loved hooking up with me.‘What he said and the words he used - I can’t even repeat it.‘I’ve
 been down this road before. I’ve been in these sorts of relationships 
where they don’t see more than that, they don’t want more than that. I 
didn’t come here for just a hook up.’'He's not the man I thought he was': It was during Juan Pablo's last date with Clare that he shocked her by whispering to her that he 'loved f***ing' her Unforgivable? The hairdresser was in tears following her boyfriend's startling behaviour, crying on her bed before he arrived at her hotel suite for their final few moments of alone time together Amazingly, even this was not enough 
to put her off - with Juan Pablo winning her around again with sweet 
talk, even telling her: ‘I know if I end up with you we’re going to have
 a baby in like a year and two months. I just know it.’‘I
 can definitely imagine my future with Juan Pablo,’ Clare once again 
insisted. ‘I know that we have something special. I don’t want a rose - I
 want forever.’While 
Nikki’s last date didn't contain as much drama, it still ended in tears 
as her 'boyfriend' repeatedly refused to reassure her about his 
feelings.‘I’m crazy 
about Juan Pablo, he’s one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met in 
my life,’ insisted Nikki, who wore a black bikini for their boating date
 and got repeated kisses on her bare shoulder. No remorse: The Bachelor didn't seem to understand the effect his words had on the clearly upset object of his affections, but he still somehow managed to wiggle out of the situation and once again win favour with her Caving in: After confronting him about his sexually explicit comment during their date, the blonde was once again won over by her beau's suave response as he assured her he didn't mean any harm and could absolutely see a future with her‘But the one thing missing about our fairytale is hearing how he feels about me.‘Until he says “I love you” I don’t know if he does or not. I’m trying not to stress about it - but it’s definitely on my mind.’She even gave him a present with an 
inscription saying she loved him - sentiments he refused to respond in 
kind - still, she insisted: ‘I feel like we have something special and I
 just don’t see him having that with someone else.’‘Wow - both women in tears on their final date with Juan Pablo,’ host Chris Harrison said.Dream date: Nikki enjoyed a picture-perfect final day with her lover, spent frolicking on a beach ‘Until he says “I love you” I don’t know if he does or not': Even on their final date, the 26-year-old was fretting that her man didn't feel the same way about her as she felt about him, though she didn't get the answers she was looking for At
 the final rose presentation, as Nikki stepped up after Clare had 
already been rejected, she seemed certain she would be walking away as a
 wife-to-be.Wearing a 
beautiful blue figure-hugging floor-length dress, she said: ‘I think 
today will end up being one of the best days of my life. I can’t wait to
 tell my mum, “Mum, I’m engaged!”’As
 they stood hand-in-hand, Nikki told Juan Pablo: ‘I can’t imagine 
spending my life without you. I don’t want it to stop. I love you’ - 
once again getting nothing stronger than a ‘thank you’ in return.Looking
 uncomfortable, Juan Pablo then told her: ‘Just know that I love so many
 things about you. That’s the reason I want you to be here.’Falling on deaf ears: On several occasions, Juan Pablo's parents - his mother in particular - attempted to warn both girls that their son wasn't such a great catch Bonding with the in-laws: Neither woman wanted to hear a bad word about their possible future husband, with each in tern professing their love for him while speaking with his mother Happy families? Both women won over Juan Pablo's family with their sincerity during their meeting - though is certainly wasn't reciprocated by the closed-off bachelor He added: ‘It’s been a perfect time 
every time I’ve been with you - especially going to your home town and 
listening to your daddy. That made me think a lot.‘When
 he said to me, “Juan Pablo, if you’re going to propose to my daughter 
you have to be 100 per cent sure’. And that made me think a lot.‘""I hope the guy that comes to ask for my daughter’s, for proposal, he’s 100 per cent sure.""‘And honestly I have a ring here in my pocket... but I’m not gonna use it.What
 went wrong? Clare had a great first meeting with Juan Pablo's daughter,
 Camila, instantly bonding with the blonde-haired youngster A friend and an ally: Clare shared a sweet 
moment with her possible future father-in-law, who told her he 
considered her to be his daughter, which made her cry with happiness 
having lost her own father previously  A new mom for Camila? Juan Pablo shares a deep and special bond with his only child, who was excited to meet both women vying for her father's heart ‘I’m not 100 per cent sure that I 
want to propose to you. But, at the same time, I’m 100 per cent sure 
that I don’t want to let you go.‘I like you a lot - a LOT - so Nikki will you accept my final rose?’After she smiled and said yes, they kissed - and then he repeatedly told her, ‘Don’t get cranky’.At
 the live after-show interviews, Chris Harrison repeatedly pressed Juan 
Pablo as to whether he did in fact love Nikki - and he repeatedly dodged
 answering the question.'I don’t want a rose - I want forever': By the time the day of the big proposal arrived, Clare was upbeat and back on track planning her future with the single father, before he broke her heart ‘Wow - both women in tears on their final date': Host Chris Harrison seemed as shocked and surprised by the turn of events as everyone else as he fronted the live studio audience ‘I feel fantastic about this woman,’ he 
said once, later saying: ‘I feel great. I show her how I feel about her.
 We’re starting our life together.’When asked most directly if he loved her, he got irritated and said: ‘I’m not going to answer that question.’Nikki insisted they’ve been ‘really happy’, and, asked if she thinks he loves her, replied: ‘I don’t know. I hope so.’'I don't know what I would do if I were Nikki': Newlyweds and Bachelor success story Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici couldn't contain their confusion at the situation, with Sean saying he didn't understand why Juan Pablo couldn't utter the L-word Seeing
 a different side to him: Even contestant Sharleen Joynt, who was a 
frontrunner before she opted to leave the show, was shocked at Juan 
Pablo's offensive behaviour with Clare and his inability to say 'I love 
you' or propose to NikkiClare,
 meanwhile, refused the usual chance to confront the man who turned her 
down, saying she felt her words to him at the time had been enough.‘That was my closure - that was all that I needed,’ she said.‘I don’t want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more B.S.’While
 Chris said he was all too happy for this season to come to an end, 
viewers can get ready for more fun to come, as Andi Dorfman, who 
famously ditched Juan Pablo after calling him out for his appalling 
behaviour, was announced as the new Bachelorette.Beyond awkward! When the 'happy couple' returned to the stage during the After The Final Rose show, Juan Pablo avoided answering any questions as to whether or not be was in love with Nikki ‘Twelve years I’ve been doing this - this is a Bachelor first': Chris didn't quite know how to respond to the situation as Juan Pablo threw everything the show had done for him back in his face  Better luck next time!

281	"Before we begin, rose lovers, let’s take a moment to think about what we’ve learned this season. First, be careful what you wish for — because you just might get a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot who can’t open his mouth without offending someone (or saying, “it’s okay”). Second, we should probably all just accept the fact that jerky Bachelors make for better TV. I mean, is there anyone out there who can name ONE interesting thing that happened on, say, Travis Stork’s or Andy Baldwin’s season without resorting to Google? If you can, I applaud you. (I am also a little afraid of you.) So let’s just embrace the bad behavior — after all, we do love it so — and bring Juan Pablo’s “adventure” to a close.¿Dónde está la primera “lady”? Clare is here in her bright fuschia dress, bearing an unruly bouquet of flowers and a nervous smile. Camila rejects Clare’s outstretched hand and instead slaps it hard in what’s either a playful “gimme five” or an angry “back off, Stepmom Barbie!” gesture. When Clare tells Juan Pabs’ mom Nelly that she’s in love with her son, Mama responds with the impassive stare of a sphinx — though she’s honest when Clare asks if Juan Pablo has any problematic personality traits. “He’s hyperactive… He sometimes is very rude,” Nelly continues, telling Clare that Juan Pabs has made her cry with his “honesty, and he say the things a little bit rude.” Clare is determined to hear “my son is a good communicator who shares his feelings freely” instead of “my son has brought me to tears with his nasty personality.” (Side note: Enough with the picture-in-picture feed from the Tealight Candle Thunderdome, Team Bachelor! We get it — you’re liiiiiiive!)Cousin Rodolfo then asks Clare if she’s in love with Juan Pablo, and upon hearing her answer (yes, duh) he informs her that the Bachelor is the type of guy who will “walk away” when things “get rough” in a relationship. But Clare, her eye firmly on her Latino prize, gushes that if Juan Pablo proposes, it’ll be “the best day of my life.” (I mean, she’s practically “begging for it,” right Rodolfo?) At the very least, she’d get a fantastic father-in-law; Juan Pablo’s dad Saul receives Clare with great warmth and assures her that even if she doesn’t get the final rose, she’ll “be always in my mind.” Ours too, papa. (Or, at least until After the Final Rose is over.)Nikki wins the Thunderdome audience applause-o-meter, but to be fair both “ladies” receive pretty tepid reactions.Now, though, it’s time to make mental space for Nikki, who arrives with an identical flower bouquet and a hot pink halter-top maxi dress. And guess what? Within seconds she’s already complaining. The island is “beautiful,” she tells Nelly, “but it’s hot.” Then she starts yammering on about how “life-changing” it’s been to make out with Juan Pablo in various international settings, while Camila — who’s perched on daddy’s lap — studiously avoids acknowledging Nikki’s existence. Saul wastes no time telling the nurse that his son “is not an easy guy,” that Juan Pabs is always focused on what he wants, and that he thinks he’s always right. No worries, says Nikki, she’s “ready for it.”NEXT: Juan Pablo talks dirty to Clare, and she does NOT love it

283	"TrendingBoth Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley looked absolutely beautiful when they met Juan Pablo Galavis for that final rose — after he took them home to meet his family. So, who did he choose? And who totally dissed him after getting sent home?We know you can’t wait to hear who he picks, but first, let us fill you in on what you missed on The Bachelor finale.Meeting the parents is apparently just as awkward for the Bachelor and his leading ladies as it is for normal couples, huh? [hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″][hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]






When Juan Pablo brought home Nikki and Clare to get to meet his parents, brother, cousin and of course, his daughter Camila, it was just about as awkward as you’d imagine. Clare was of course eager as could be to meet his parents — she totally told his mom everything and more, and they really clicked. She explained how great of a listener he was (what?) and that he was always honest even if it was something she didn’t want to hear — this led to Juan Pablo’s mom agreeing with what we’ve all been thinking: he can be “very rude!” She even said that he’s made her cry before!As for Nikki, she dove right in too. She wanted to know if his mom thought he was ready. Of course, the answer was that she was “pretty sure” — probably not exactly the answer that she was looking for now that it’s down to the final two. She also sat down with Juan Pablo’s cousin for an awkward conversation about fighting, Juan Pablo’s attitude, and how she’ll deal with it. She said she thought they would “fight well” together. Whatever that means!For his last date with Clare, he takes her away in a helicopter ride — and when they landed there was no cameras or lights, and Clare was, of course excited for a moment alone with him so he could whisper some sweet nothings in her ear. Instead though, he told her that that he didn’t know her at all as well as “some sexual thing” that she couldn’t even repeat. Naturally, she was heartbroken.However, she called him out on it and told him that if there were doubts, it needed to be open because to her it’s much more than physical and she’s much more than a hook up. After he spent some time begging her for a kiss, she finally told him she needed to know where his head was at, and he said all the right things — that he could see a future with her. He even played “No Better Lovers” by Josh Krajcik, which they danced to together earlier in the season. Of course, Clare said they can dance to it at their wedding.After all that awkwardness, we almost forgot he had to take out Nikki. Right away, she was explaining to the cameras that she too wanted to know how he felt. But, of course he said it was gonna be “okay.” It was clear that she really “wanted forever” as she put it, as she even framed a picture of them along with a super sweet card. After he left, she wasn’t happy — she sat and balled her eyes out.






I don’t think I’ve ever been so heartbroken before in my life. The moment that JP said “I have to say goodbye to you” to Clare, my heart seriously broke. After he told her, he went in for a hug — and she put her hands up — and the crowd applauded. Good for her! She called him out on saying that she could see himself with her in Sacramento, having kids with her, etc., and said that she “believed in us.”“I saved this moment for the man of my dreams, I thought that as you, I thought I knew what kind of man you were,” she said before COMPLETELY slamming him, saying “I would never want my children having a father like you.” Juan Pablo proved right there it wasn’t a match when he said, “I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”It got even more intense when Clare said to the cameras, “Don’t tell me you loved f–king me.” Ouch!Next up was Nikki, who had no idea what just went down. However, she told Juan Pablo how much she loved him and he answered by telling her that there are many things that he loves about her. He also brought up the fact that Nikki’s father told him to be 100% sure if he was going to purpose!“I’m not 100% sure that I want to propose to you but I’m 100% sure that I don’t want to let you go,” he told her, adding, “I like you a lot. So Nikki, will you except my final rose?”Of course she did, but he still never said “I love you!”So, are they still together– tune in to After the Final Rose to see!

285	"The Bachelor's Season 18 is finally done, and winner Nikki Ferrell got no engagement ring, no ""I love you"" and no commitment to move in together any time soon. Fans were disappointed, Chris Harrison was pissed, and Sean Lowe seemed incredulous. Now Bachelor viewers everywhere are asking: Was Juan Pablo Galavis really on the show to fall in love and find a wife?During the ""After The Final Rose"" show, Nikki admitted that Juan Pablo has never told her he loves her. She smiled and said she loves Juan Pablo, but he hasn't gotten close to those three words she so desperately longs to hear.Chris Harrison, Sean Lowe and his wife Catherine Giudici were shocked. Juan Pablo tried to explain that living through the show publicly has been trying for both him and Nikki. He said he and Nikki want to start their relationship over in private. Sean tried to explain to him that a private life is no longer possible. But Juan Pablo didn't want to hear it.The hardest moments to watch on The Bachelor 2014 finale were the last ones where Nikki expressed her huge love for Juan Pablo and he didn't reciprocate.


Nikki Ferrell looked exquisite - and very nervous - as she approached Juan Pablo for the final rose ceremony on Season 18 of 'The Bachelor'.


""I want to hear all the things he hasn't been able to say to me,"" Nikki told the viewers. ""I want Juan Pablo to tell me he loves me.""""I love so many things about you,"" Juan Pablo told her. ""I love how much you care about other people. I love your honesty so much. So much. ... It's been a perfect time every time I'm with you.""But then he recalled when Nikki's father told him he wanted Juan Pablo to be 100-percent sure if he was going to propose to his daughter. ""Honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket,"" he told her.


Nikki Ferrell received the final rose but not an engagement ring on the Season 18 finale of 'The Bachelor'.


Nikki's eyes suddenly lit up when he talked about a ring. But the glimmer soon faded. ""I'm not going to use [the ring],"" Juan Pablo continued. ""I'm not 100-percent sure I want to propose to you. But at the same time I'm 100-percent sure that I don't want to let you go.""""I like you a lot. A lot,"" he said. ""Nikki, will you accept my final rose?""Nikki said absolutely, but she looked heartbroken and defeated. We wished she said no. We really did. Because at the end of the day Juan Pablo didn't say ""I love you.""


Andi showed her tough side while dumping Juan Pablo on 'The Bachelor.'


This is far from the first time that Juan Pablo has hurt or offended. Andi dumped Juan Pablo after a nightmare Fantasy Suite date in one of the most dramatic Bachelor exits we've ever seen.Heartbroken and fuming, Andi tried to explain to Juan Pablo that he wasn't getting it. She felt hurt and stupid after spending an evening with him and taking time off from her high-powered career as an assistant district attorney.Andi slammed Juan Pablo saying she “can’t stand"" being with him. After laying in bed awake next to him as he slept, Andi realized Juan Pablo couldn't care less about her thoughts on religion or politics, she said. “It’s important for me to be with a guy who loves me more than he loves himself.”Andi's complaint about Juan Pablo is nothing new. All season, everyone but Nikki, Clare and Renee has called out the Bachelor being stupid, shallow, insensitive, hurtful and fake. But was it all sour grapes?


L - R: Andi, Renee and Sharleen sat in the front row during the 'Women Tell All' episode, and they didn't mince words. 


That's what Bachelor host Chris Harrison was trying to figure out on the ""Women Tell All"" episode. ""Clearly, Juan Pablo [is] an attractive man,"" Harrison told the contestants. ""Why wasn't that enough?""Andi was the first to respond, saying: ""At the end of the day,"" she said. ""Those looks can fade, and you need something more than that."" Sharleen, the opera singer who dumped Juan Pablo before Andi did, was surprisingly sweet when talking about Juan Pablo on the ""Women Tell All"". But even she admitted that the Bachelor has two personalities. When asked if it was wrong to blame Clare for hooking up in the ocean at 4:00 a.m., she said: ""I think he had a case of buyer's remorse. He didn't man up the way he should have."" Between his chiseled abs and adorable stories about his daughter Juan Pablo often seemed like he was too good to be true. So what do you think?

	                    Whew. The worst — and most bizarre — season of ""The Bachelor"" is finally over.After a rocky season filled with tears, anger and controversial comments, Bachelor Juan Pablo did not get down on one knee to propose to a lucky bride-to-be in Saint Lucia. Instead, he offered the last woman standing, Nikki Ferrell, just a rose.“I can’t imagine spending my life without you,” Nikki, 26, told Juan Pablo, clearly expecting a diamond ring. “I love you.”“I can see you as a good stepmom for Camilla,” Juan Pablo, 32, said. “It’s been a perfect time every time I’m with you.” Then it got awkward.“I have a ring here in my pocket and I’m not going to use it,” he said. “I’m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you, but at the same time, I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t want to let you go. I like you a lot. So, Nikki, will you accept my final rose?”   “Absolutely,” Nikki said.Really?Runner-up Clare Crawley’s departure was just as uncomfortable.“I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along,” Juan Pablo told Clare. “But I have to follow what I think is best for me. I’ll have to say goodbye to you.”Clare is livid.“This entire time I’ve stuck around because I believed in you,” she said, fighting back tears. “I needed that reassurance [on our date last night] and I gave you that opportunity right then.”Clare was alluding to an off-camera moment during the pair’s last date, when Juan Pablo told Clare he barely knew her at all. “He told me that he really doesn’t know me and then said some sexual thing,” Clare said the night before. “It was insulting and it made me feel awful.  The words he used…I can’t even repeat it.”Clare cited Sharleen Joynt and Andi Dorfman, two women who exited the show as soon as they weren’t feeling the relationship.“You had every opportunity like those other girls did to tell me how you felt,” she said. “I lose respect for you. I would never want my children having a father like you.” Ouch. Even more ouch? Juan Pablo’s comment under his breath when Clare ran away in tears.“I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”The show got even more bizarre during the live “After the Final Rose” special after the taped finale.  Juan Pablo and Nikki made their first appearance in public together, and while most “Bachelor” couples gush about finally being able to appear together after three months of hiding, profess their love repeatedly and show off engagement rings, the mood was quite awkward and emotionless.“So you love her?” host Chris Harrison asked. “I’m not going to answer that question,” Juan Pablo said. “People don’t understand this is real life. We’re very happy and we are so done with the show.”“So….you’re not gonna tell us you love her?” Chris asked, obviously baffled. “This is what this show is about.  We’re on this journey with you. This is your time to shine. You can express your feelings.”Chris polled former “Bachelor” alums in the audience, newlyweds Catherine and Sean Lowe, who tried to explain to Juan Pablo that he signed up for a reality show and the spotlight is part of the deal.“Don’t bite the hand that fed you,” Catherine said, to loud applause from the studio audience.“This is a real relationship to us,” Nikki said. “We’re taking it very seriously. He has a daughter, he doesn’t just have himself to think about.”“Sorry the show didn’t end up like you guys wanted it to,” Juan Pablo said, to boos from the audience.   “This is so awkward,” Chris said laughing, as he tried one more time to get just a bit of information from the couple by asking them their plans for the future.“We have our plans,” Juan Pablo said. “It’s something we want to keep private.”“Bachelor” fans breathed a collective sigh of relief when the show cut to a commercial break and Chris was able to announce the new Bachelorette — Atlanta assistant district attorney and fan-favorite — Andi. The new season of “The Bachelorette” premiers May 19.   Ron White's UGLY splitMeet JLaw's MUCH older beauBourdain: I'd poison TrumpEx reveals truth about PrattRowling RIPPED over TrumpCarrie's shocking autopsy results'Bachelor' twins shockHow Drew recoveredThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

290	"TrendingClare Crowley has had enough of Juan Pablo Galavis. After he sent her home during the season 18 finale of The Bachelor, she realized he wasn’t at all who she wanted. So, when Chris Harrison asked if she wanted to see him, she flat out said no.We’ve got to say — go Clare! When Chris Harrison asked if she wanted to bring out Juan Pablo, she admitted that she had thought about that.[hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″][hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]



Take Our Poll“Looking back and thinking about that day in St. Lucia, that day was pivotal for me, because I had never been able to stand up for myself to a man before,” she explained. “I think so many women can relate to that where you want to have hope, and you give it chance after chance, and it was so liberating to be able to stand there and say, ‘this is exactly how I feel’ and ‘it’s not okay.’ To be able to stand there, to be able to say every word and how I felt, and get it all out there that day in St. Lucia — that was my closure. That was all I needed, and that enough was closer for me. I don’t wanna sit here on this couch and get fed anymore BS.”






So, Chris asked if there was anything she wanted him to say or ask.“You know what, ‘no.’ I’ve moved on, I’ve moved forward,” she explained. “Watching it back, is closure for me and it’s all the answers that I needed. He’s plain and simple not the man that I thought he was, and it’s so disappointing because I had such high hope for it.”After he completely broke her art by not only choosing Nikki Ferrell, but by leading her on and really offending her, it’s not surprising that she didn’t want to. What do you think, HollywoodLifers? Should she have sat down and talked with him again? Let us know!— Emily LongerettaFollow @EmilyLongeretta"	Entertainment

The color perfectly complimented her beautiful blonde locks, which she wore half-back and away from her face. And although the dress was fitted, it still managed to look flowing, which is a credit to the 26-year-old winner’s rocking bod and extremely long, graceful legs.Even though Juan Pablo didn’t propose to Nikki in the end of the show, she still won him over more than any of the other ladies — which is not surprising, considering how stunning she is! This dress, classic and elegant, was the perfect choice for Nikki’s final rose ceremony, and it certainly made for beautiful TV.Despite her loss tonight, Clare Crawley‘s finale look is still worth mentioning. She wore an ornate, floor-length turquoise gown that was both beautiful and flattering.The one-shoulder draped extravaganza also featured a slit, though not quite as high as Nikki’s! It showed off Clare’s petite frame as well, thanks to a thick rhinestone band around her waist.Although she didn’t end up with the final rose, Clare still looked beautiful and she can go home proud as the final runner-up to Juan Pablo’s corazon.Whose dress was your favorite, HollywoodLifers — Clare’s or Nikki’s?

297	"Juan Pablo Galavis appears in an interview with OTRC.com on Jan. 7, 2014. / 'The Bachelor' season 18 finalists Clare and Nikki appear in publicity photos. The finale airs on March 10 at 8 p.m. ET. (ABC / Rick Rowell)The wait is over -- ""The Bachelor"" season 18 finale, which aired on Monday, March 10, showed who Juan Pablo Galavis chose from among two finalists.So was it Clare or Nikki? Did he propose?Spoiler alert!Galavis ended up picking Nikki over Clare but did NOT propose to her. Check out 5 highlights from the two-hour episode (also check out PHOTOS).1. The women meet Juan Pablo's familyThe finale was set in beautiful St. Lucia, the scene of a past episode. Clare and Nikki each got a chance to meet Galavis' parents and cousin Rodolfo. The women seem enamored by watching Galavis interact with his daughter. Clare gushes to his family about how she can't wait to be a mother and wants four children.""I could 1,000 percent see myself a part of Juan Pablo's family forever,"" she later says.As for Nikki, she says she's nervous because she knows Galavis' family is really important to him. She had met his parents and daughter in a previous episode.Nikki rattles off all the places they've visited during the season. Galavis' daughter seems bored.Galavis loves to talk about how honest he is. Honestly must run in his family -- key words Galavis' mother used to describe him include ""hyperactive -- super hyperactive"" and sometimes ""very rude.""""He's not an easy guy,"" Galavis' dad says about his son, while speaking to Nikki. ""I'm telling you because he's vocalized in what he wants. He's always very specific in what he wants. He thinks he [knows] the truth in everything.""""Juan Pablo ... I mean I love the guy -- he's a really great guy -- but sometimes, when things are getting rough, he'll walk away from the relationship,"" Rodolfo tells Nikki.I feel like we would fight well together,"" Nikki jokes.2. WHAT did Juan Pablo Galavis tell Clare?Galavis goes on a final date with each of the contestants. Clare says that during theirs, while they were in a helicopter, he told her something off-camera ""that no woman wants to hear.""""[He said] that he really doesn't know me and some sexual thing I don't even want to repeat,"" she said. ""It was insulting. It was offensive and it just made me feel awful.""""I'm not just an object,"" she added. ""Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he's not the man that I thought he was.""Clare, who, by the way, is the contestant Galavis famously frolicked with in the ocean during a past date (nothing more than PG-13 was shown on TV), later confronts Galavis about it. They start a very serious conversation, during which he stroked her leg, and she tells him she wants their relationship to be more than just physical. He tells her they have more than just a physical attraction. ""I like what I have seen during the entire adventure,"" he says.""'Am I ready?' is my question,"" Galavis said. ""'Do I know the person?'""Clare's anger over his past offensive remarks appears to melt away. She is already daydreaming about that ring. (Heck, she's practically daydreaming about hanging out at the jewelry store, picking out bridal necklaces, after dropping off the ring to be resized because that's what happens a LOT when men pick out rings.)""That's what I want to hear,"" she says. ""That's the kind of stuff I want to hear. I wanna hear about more than like, 'I like kissing you, I like kissing you.' I know it gets tough after this. I know it's gonna be hard after this. If I am gonna be with somebody, I want them to know that they want to be with me.""Got all that? Who said relationships are complicated?3. Love letterNikki, by contrast, seems far less dramatic than Clare, and a lot more pensive and possibly naive.""I'm in love with this guy,"" she says. ""I want forever with him.""He reads a mushy handwritten letter she wrote to him (flashback: ""The Babysitter's Club,"" Kristy), makes out with her a bit more and then leaves. She sits on a coach, crying.FYI to single women: Alpha-males LOVE love letters.*4. Clare finally stands up for herself because ...Seriously, Clare is so over the mysterious offensive comment and is ready to get engaged. Babies. She's probably ready for babies. She stands in front of Galavis in a one-shoulder teal gown on a beach, holding his hand, waiting.""I wish ... I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along,"" he says. ""... I have to say goodbye to you.""Uh oh.Then she lets him have it.""I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you and I thought I knew what kind of man you were,"" she says.Galavis graciously offers to tell her the precise moment he decided not to choose her. She finally stands up for herself and declines.""Doesn't matter to me,"" she says. ""I lost respect for you. I'll tell you what. I thought I knew what kind of man you were. What you just made me go though ... I would never want my children having a father like you.""After she walks away, Galavis says: ""Whew. I'm glad I didn't pick her.""5. Thanks DAD!!!Host Chris Harrison, who is standing in front of a live studio audience partially populated by former ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette"" couples as well as current eliminated contestants, reveals that Galavis DID pick out a diamond engagement ring. It was designed by Neil Lane, which follows ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette"" tradition. Will Nikki get it?Dressed in a cobalt blue gown with a thigh-high slit, she walks up to Galavis.""I can't wait to tell my mom, like, 'Mom, I'm engaged,"" she is heard narrating.To Galavis, she says he is an amazing person and that she has waited a long time for this ""once-of-a-lifetime"" moment and that she cannot imagine spending her life without him.""I love you,"" she says.""Whew,"" he says. ""Just know that I love so many things about you.""Uh oh.Galavis told her that when her father told him (in a previous episode) that he should only propose to Nikki if he was absolutely sure about it, that made him ""think a lot.""""And honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket and I'm not gonna use it,"" Galavis says, twisting the knife he just stabbed in Nikki's heart. 'Uh uh. I'm not 100 percent sure that I wanna propose to you. At the same time, I'm 100 percent sure that I just don't wanna let you go.""Then, the final blow.""I like you a lot,"" he continues. ""A lot.""And he gives her a consolation prize -- hint -- she's got a collection of them.Galavis gave Nikki a rose.""Nikki will you accept my final rose?"" he asks.She nods. ""Absolutely.""Ignoring the naked, chilly feeling on her ring finger, she makes out with him a bit while clutching the rose. Think she'll keep it in a flower press with the words ""Worst consolation prize ever"" scrawled on it?   ""The Bachelor: After The Final Rose"" Clare declined invitation to confront Juan Pablo Galavis   During the live ""After The Final Rose"" segment, which aired after the finale, Harrison offered Clare the chance to confront Galavis about his rejection of her, in front of the eager studio audience.   ""Looking back and thinking about that day in St. Lucia, that day was pivotal for me because I had never been able to stand up for myself to a man before and I think so many women can relate to that, where you want to have hope, you give it chance after chance,"" she says.   Clare says that moment gave her closure.   ""I don't want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more B.S.,"" she says.   That's too bad, because it would have made for entertaining TV, Clare. Juan Pablo Galavis talks about rejecting Clare   ""To me, it was very hard to say to people and honestly, at the end of the day, I made the decision that I thought was good for me,"" he says. ""It is what it is.""   Regarding Clare, he says: ""We had rollercoasters and we lived through out and it worked out the way it worked out.""   He refused to reveal what he told Clare during their date, which she found offensive.   ""People have private conversations,"" he says. ""From my mouth, nothing is gonna come out. It's something that is personal.""   ""I have nothing bad to talk about Clare,"" he adds. ""She was great -- she was there for a reason.""""The Bachelor: After The Final Rose""Clare declined invitation to confront Juan Pablo Galavis   During the live ""After The Final Rose"" segment, which aired after the finale, Harrison offered Clare the chance to confront Galavis about his rejection of her, in front of the eager studio audience.

""Has he told you he loves you?"" he asks.   ""Not exactly,"" she replies. ""I know that he does. I've never told someone I love them first so it's been a struggle. If he wasn't invested in this relationship and making this work, he wouldn't be with me.""   ""I'm not gonna force it,"" she adds. ""It's on his time and I'm happy in a relationship and I know he is too, so I feel like that should matter more than anything.""Juan Pablo Galavis humiliates his non-fiancee on national television   Galavis then joins her on the couch.

""So I'm very honest to her and I keep things to ourselves and I show her how I feel about her and she's happy with that.""   Nikki remains silent, smiling politely as Galavis drones on about how it's been ""tough"" and then scolds Harrison for interrupting him earlier in the show.   Sean Lowe, the star of season 17 of ""The Bachelor"" who recently wed Catherine Giudici, who won, offers his opinion on the whole situation.   ""When I'm in love, I want that person to know it,"" he says (brags?), adding: ""To each their own.""How long is Nikki going to remain in a relationship with Juan Pablo Galavis?   When asked this by Harrison, Nikki replies: ""As long as it feels right, I'll give it that length of time. Once it doesn't feel right, I think I' m gonna be out. But it feels right.""""We have plans,"" Galavis adds. ""Now we're gonna figure it out in our private life.""Also on ""The Bachelor: After The Final Rose,"" the new star of the upcoming season of ""The Bachelorette"" was revealed.

298	"If tonight’s Twitter reaction is any indication, Juan Pablo Galavis has effectively sealed his fate as The Bachelor‘s most despised contestant ever.We had to do our own background research to provide you the background, so here goes: Galavis had previously drawn outrage for comments about a potential gay Bachelor being “too hard to watch” because homosexuals tend to be “more pervert.”Since then, his tenure with the show has been marred by battles with executive producers over those comments, and his general on-air behavior. But his actions in tonight’s finale took home the prize for odiousness, according to the internet.Apparently Galavis’ selection between the top two choices to receive a proposal for marriage (What even is this show?) ended in an incredibly awkward fashion: One girl went home in tears, while the winner was given a non-proposal, told he “liked” her, and offered a rose as consolation of some sort.Flash forward to the live, in-studio conversation between Galavis, the winner Nikki Ferrell, and host Chris Harrison. Galavis accused his host of repeatedly interrupting him, while refusing to go anywhere near saying he “loves” Ferrell, even though the 26-year-old woman has said multiple times that she has fallen “in love” with him. The audience boos, previous Bachelors chime in to rebuke Galavis — the whole thing is bizarre, even from an outsider perspective.If you need any further proof of how much this man is now despised, just look at the tweets here.

301	"Nikki Ferrell, pediatric nurse from Kansas City's Children's Mercy Hospital, won the final rose on ABC's ""The Bachelor,"" but didn't get a ring or even an ""I love you"" from star Juan Pablo Galavis.Ferrell outplayed a cast of other women on the long-running reality show, competing for the heart of Galavis. He chose Ferrell over rival finalist Clare Crawley, who had strong words for him after being rejected in the final rose ceremony.On the reunion show after the telecast, Ferrell said she was relieved that the show was over. She said she's still in a relationship with Galavis, something they've struggled to keep secret.She also revealed that while she loves him, he's never told her that he loves her back. He also declined a multiple opportunities to tell Nikki that he loved her during the reunion show.Ferrell said that Juan Pablo's actions speak louder than words.""If he wasn't invested in the relationship, he wouldn't be with me,"" she said.During their home visit to Kansas City, Galavis and Ferrell visited Oklahoma Joe's BBQ and a bar at Kansas City's Power and Light District.Ferrell and Galavis didn't reveal what their next plans were or whether they planned to continue to live in separate cities. Galavis said he wanted to keep the future details of their relationship private.Ferrell's friends gathered at a home in Westwood, Kan., to watch the finale.""It's very strange,"" said friend Carol McGinness. ""At the beginning of this before she went, a group of got together and gave her some advice and just kind of celebrated this journey she was going on, and so finally getting to the end and being able to have open conversations with her and talk about it and be excited with her in a whole different way is really exciting.""Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on purchases made through our links to retailer sites."

304	"Warning: Massive Bachelor season 18 spoilers ahead! If you haven&apos;t yet seen the March 10 season finale of Juan Pablo Galavis&apos; season of the Bachelor, don&apos;t continue reading!In what will surely be one of the most contested, debated Bachelor seasons ever — so many tears! — season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis gave out his final rose to one, er, lucky lady. In the end, the polarizing 32-year-old Venezuelan-born hunk&apos;s final choice was between hairstylist Clare Crawley and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell. So which ""lucky"" lady got the final rose? Let&apos;s recap!

				PHOTOS: Juan Pablo's bachelorettes			
The action begins in St. Lucia, with both Clare, 32, and Nikki, 26, meeting Juan Pablo&apos;s straight-talking family. Clare&apos;s up first, and she wastes no time before telling Juan Pablo&apos;s mom, Nelly, that she&apos;s in love with her son. Nelly, in turn, answers honestly when Clare asks if Juan Pablo has any ticks she should know about. ""He&apos;s hyperactive,"" she replies. ""He sometimes is very rude."" Juan Pablo&apos;s cousin Rodolfo has some harsh truths for Clare, too, telling her that the man she&apos;s in love with is the kind of guy who will walk away when things ""get rough."" None of this changes Clare&apos;s feelings, though; she maintains that it&apos;ll be ""the best day of [her] life"" if Juan Pablo proposes.Nikki gets more of the same from Juan Pablo&apos;s family. ""He&apos;s not an easy guy,"" Juan Pablo&apos;s father warns her. ""It&apos;s always about what he wants."" To drive the point home, Nelly tells Nikki that the fantasies she has of their life together — game nights and family beach trips — are just that. ""You feel he is the kind of guy you want?"" Nelly asks. ""You&apos;re sure?"" Nikki insists she is, but it&apos;s kind of hard to believe, given that even Juan Pablo&apos;s family doesn&apos;t seem to like him all that much.

Moving on to the final one-on-one dates! Clare&apos;s up first again, and she happily joins Juan Pablo on a helicopter ride over St. Lucia. Somewhere between takeoff and landing, though, the ""happily"" part goes away. Once on solid ground again, Clare reveals Juan Pablo whispered something in her ear that she can&apos;t bear to even repeat. ""What I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth, and I&apos;m shocked, she says. ""He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. That he doesn&apos;t know me and some sexual thing I don&apos;t want to repeat. It was insulting and it was offensive…Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he&apos;s not the man I thought he was.""ABC
Later that night, in her hotel room, she confronts Juan Pablo about what he said to her. He deflects any blame from himself and tries to gloss over the situation by saying that he&apos;s just struggling with the decision he has to make between her and Nikki. He also assures Clare that she&apos;s special to him, and even goes so far as to say that if they end up together, they&apos;ll have a baby in no time. ""Now it&apos;s like I know it&apos;s definitely a lot more than physical attraction between us,"" she says in a confessional, apparently satisfied with his explanation. ""Tonight, I know that he wants me here.""

Ah, but what about tomorrow? Nikki&apos;s final one-on-one date is up next, and she and Juan Pablo can&apos;t keep their hands off each other. There&apos;s a lot of making out — but what Nikki really wants is for Juan Pablo to tell her he loves her. ""I&apos;m in love with this guy,"" she gushes. ""I want forever with him. I do!""The question, of course, is whether he wants the same thing with her. Fortunately, she doesn&apos;t have to wait long to find out. After a brief commercial break, the camera zooms in on Juan Pablo at the final rose ceremony, where he&apos;s waiting to meet Clare. He feeds her some platitudes about how ""unbelievable"" and ""amazing"" she is, and then cuts to the chase: ""I wish the earth sucked me today, because this is the hardest decision."" Clare is heartbroken — but more than that, she&apos;s angry, and she rejects Juan Pablo&apos;s goodbye hug. ""I&apos;ve saved this moment for the man of my dreams, and I thought that was you,"" she says bitterly. ""What you just made me go through — I would never want my children having a father like you.""

Juan Pablo&apos;s response? ""Whoo! I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t pick her.""So how does he feel about the woman he did pick? Lukewarm, apparently. Though he ""chooses"" Nikki at the final rose ceremony, he&apos;s not quite ready to tell her he loves her. ""I love how much you care about other people,"" he begins. ""I love your honesty, so much…I can see you as a good stepmom for Camila."" That said, he&apos;s not ready to see her as a good wife for himself. ""I have a ring in my pocket, but I&apos;m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you,"" he confesses. ""But I&apos;m 100 percent sure I don&apos;t want to let you go. I like you a lot. A lot."" Good enough! ""Nikki, will you accept my final rose?"" he asks. ""Absolutely,"" she replies.End scene! Tell Us: What&apos;d you think of the finale?

	                        Juan Pablo Galavis, star of the 18th edition of ""The Bachelor"" airing Mondays on ABC. 
	                        
	                        	 (The Associated Press)
	                        
	                    It's no secret there's been a ton of negativity surrounding this season of  “The Bachelor.” But while fans, celebrity and otherwise, have shared their distaste for Season 18 star Juan Pablo, it's also been one of the most talked-about seasons in the series' 14-year history. Which begs the question: Does a detested Bachelor actually make for a more successful season?  When host  Chris Harrison announced on The Bachelorette’s “After the Final Rose” special in August that Juan Pablo was the franchise's newest star, the immediate reaction was mixed. Fans seemed excited to finally have a minority Bachelor, but Juan Pablo was also viewed by some as a questionable choice.Unlike past seasons that starred a previously rejected contestant, viewers knew very little about Juan Pablo. Eliminated in Week 6 on “The Bachelorette” without having had a one-on-one date, all we really knew was that Juan Pablo was a former professional soccer player from Venezuela with a 4-year-old daughter. How would he interact with women one-on-one on camera? How would he handle himself in interviews? How was he with his daughter? The only thing anyone knew with relative certainty: Juan Pablo was sexy, which, to be fair, is a very important characteristic when choosing the lead.  ""You have to go with how you feel at the time and the information you have at the time, and, for us, Juan Pablo was easily the best choice at the time,"" Harrison tells TVGuide.com  Heading into the January season premiere, ABC played up Juan Pablo's Latin background with its ""Juan-uary"" promos. The network even announced three Sunday specials, culminating in a three-year ratings high for the show's premiere. But then came controversy. Just before the third episode, Juan Pablo infamously said in an interview  that he didn't think the show should have a gay or bisexual star because gay people were ""more pervert."" The soundbite made headlines everywhere, and angry viewers and non-fans alike tweeted their disgust. Juan Pablo posted an apology, but the dust never really settled.  A couple weeks later, viewers were talking about Juan Pablo's late-night swim with Clare, which Juan Pablo later used to shame her. (He claimed he regretted the seemingly innocent rendezvous.) Towards the end of the season, another oddity occurred: Contestants left the show because they couldn't see a future with Juan Pablo. Whereas during most seasons the rejected women cried hysterically upon their eliminations, some of this season's ladies were honest in their lack of interest. Notably, opera singer Sharleen exited just before hometown dates saying, ""There's a little voice in my head telling me that this is not right...The idea of proposal doesn't seem like something that is possible for me.""  During fantasy suite week, Andi  also left the show on her own accord, telling Juan Pablo that he had no respect for her, was immature, and couldn't care less about getting to know her. But, as is often the case, the supposed backlash against Juan Pablo actually translated to more buzz about the show.   ""I've done more interviews — random ones from Sports Radio to The New York Times — about this season and the controversy surrounding him, including the remarks off-camera,"" Harrison says. And perhaps even more telling, at the ""Women Tell All"" special, for the first time the fights weren't between the girls, but with the star.  But has Juan Pablo actually hurt the franchise? Consider last season's star Sean Lowe, who was arguably the most liked Bachelor to date and who eventually married his winning contestant Catherine  on an ABC special. But Sean's season had the lowest-rated premiere in the show's history and his finale garnered 10 million viewers, just a smidge ahead of Ben Flajnik’s  Season 16 finale, but less than Seasons 13, 14 and 15. (It's worth noting that, after an initial spike generated from Juan Pablo's insensitive comments, viewership has been steadily dropping. Perhaps the Olympics or the return of “The Voice” are to blame, or maybe viewers lost interest around the same time Sharleen and Andi did.)So, is Juan Pablo truly a ""bad"" Bachelor? ""I don't know how you answer that,"" Harrison says. ""Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven't that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor. ... People want to follow Juan Pablo because he's unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions. Sean's decisions were cut and dry whereas Juan Pablo you're leaving scratching your head. So, a season like this draws you to discuss.  ""We need you to love the Bachelor or hate the Bachelor because we need you to have an opinion,"" Harrison continues. ""Apathy is what kills us, when you just don't care what happens. With Sean, there weren't any negatives and it was just a matter of who the lucky lady was going to be. With Juan Pablo, it's how are we going to land this plane with no landing gear and the pilot is passed out? I like the fact that there are both ends of the spectrum here. All I hope for is for you to have an opinion about Juan Pablo. Some people love him and will defend him, but then there are those who can't stand him and he gets on their last nerve.""  Despite the way his missteps have created buzz, Harrison insists that the producers didn't cast Juan Pablo to be a lightning rod. ""We didn't go into Juan Pablo's season thinking this guy is going to be really controversial on- and off-camera,"" Harrison says. ""We thought he'd be the Latin version of Sean. [We thought,] he's a good family man looking for love, and turns out he's not in the way Sean was.""  So, looking back, would Harrison have done it differently? ""I have no regrets about him being the Bachelor,"" Harrison says. ""It's a very different season, and, in my opinion, not a bad season. He's not a bad guy. When you have a very specific Bachelor with a different culture, a somewhat different language, yes it's going to narrow down the field and the women who will fall for this guy. But I think it's been very interesting. I can't even explain what a different journey this was for me and our fans. We're on a roller coaster and we're all just hanging on for dear life and have no idea what's coming next.""

306	"“The Bachelor” premiered on March, 25, 2002 on ABC, with the premise of 25 women competing for the heart of one man. Hosted by Chris Harrison, the show has The Bachelor go on a series of dates with groups of women, as well as on individual dates, all in the hope of finding a wife. The elimination process consists of a rose ceremony, in which roses are handed out to the women who The Bachelor chooses to keep on the show. Those who don’t receives flowers at each week’s “rose ceremony” are sent home. At the end of each season, “The Bachelor” must choose between two women, with the expectation that he’ll propose to one of them.The contestants live in “Villa De La Vina,” a mansion in Agoura Hills, California, for the first two weeks of filming. The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.  The first “Bachelor” was Alex Michel. At the end of the first season, Michel had to chose between Amanda Marsh and Trista Rehn, better known now as Trista Sutter. Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.” The series has featured a slew of hunky and memorable Bachelors over the years including, Andrew Firestone, Lorenzo Borghese, Charlie O’Connell, Bob Guiney, Brad Womack, Jason Mesnick, Jake Pavelka, Sean Lowe, Juan Pablo Galavis and Ben Higgins. It has has also spawned three spin-off series on ABC. “The Bachelorette” debuted in January 2003 with Rehn as its inaugural star. “Bachelor Pad,” where previous contestants competed for a cash prize of $250,000, debuted on August 9, 2010. And “Bachelor in Paradise,” which also features previous contestants from both “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in an exotic locale, first aired on August 4, 2014.Though “The Bachelor” has earned a reputation for not having the relationships work out, there have been a few high-profile weddings during its run. Rehn, Mesnick, Hebert, and Lowe have all had weddings specials air on ABC.February 5th, 2018January 29th, 2018January 22nd, 2018January 15th, 2018January 8th, 2018January 2nd, 2018January 1st, 2018January 1st, 2018September 7th, 2017August 31st, 2017August 25th, 2017August 25th, 2017June 15th, 2017May 15th, 2017March 28th, 2017« Previous

Take Our PollSee, now you know what I mean when I say “ouch!”






Of course we haven’t see Juan Pablo actually hook up with any of the girls, they have had overnight dates and Clare was alone with him in the ocean that night!Juan Pablo has been dissed repeatedly during his run as the Bachelor — by people on the show! After Andi Dorfman went off on him after the over night dates, she took to Instagram to actually mock him wiping something off her face.Then she captioned it with, “ees ok,” mocking his accent.So, it’s no secret that he’s not a favorite. “The reason he was so interested in being the Bachelor was to make money and become more famous,” an insider told the magazine. “He’s always actively looking for money and work.”What do you think about the diss HollywoodLifers? Do you think it could be true or that one of the girls is just making things up? Let us know!— Emily Longeretta"	Entertainment

“I love it, we had a disagreement, but we communicated and he made sure to say, ‘this is how i feel’ even if it’s not what you want to hear,” Clare explained — which is true. We know, since he never holds back!

312	 Reviews Juan Pablo Galavis, Nikki Ferrell, The Bachelor 2 Comments March 10, 2014Just in case you were wondering if there was anything worse than watching Monday night’s “Bachelor” finale, there was: The “After the Final Rose” special. We listened to Chris Harrison try every trick in the book to get information on this season of the show from Juan Pablo Galavis, and was met with a rude, arrogant, entitled guy who refused to play any part of the game.So where is what Juan Pablo did. He refused to say that he loved Nikki Ferrell on-camera, he didn’t really want to be there, and he didn’t want to even say where he was going to live or what he was going to do with her.Why was he so upset? Here’s our feeling on it: He said two weeks ago that his plans changed drastically, and our theory on that is that he was probably going to be on “Dancing with the Stars,” and ABC at the last minute decided that they didn’t want him on the show. (We can only imagine why.) If this theory is right, he’s probably annoyed at the network and wanted to take it out on the network by not being anywhere close to the same guy that he was at the start of the show. He really did, to quote Catherine Giudici during this segment of the show, want to bite the hand that felt them. We don’t exactly think that “The Bachelor” is the land of all that is good and holy and that people are always on the show for love, but we do certainly think that more often than not, they are at least open and accepting of what the duties are. We felt for Chris Harrison, and it’s not often that we feel for him.This whole hour was a complete disaster, and ironically, we would have so much more sympathy for Juan Pablo if he was a guy who went through the experience, and realized after the fact while watching it that he doesn’t like the concept of fame and what has happened to him. Instead, he came across as a guy who was bitter that he didn’t get what he wanted from it, who said homophobic comments that he blamed on “culture,” and rather than actually raising good points about the parts of the “Bachelor” process that are clearly wrong and staged, looked like the biggest villain of all. We’re all relieved that this is now over, and we can move on. Hey look, Andi Dorfman’s the new “Bachelorette”! Let’s talk about her instead! Grade: F-, or something worse. We’d give it a G, if we could.If you do want to get some more news on this finale, we’ve got updates all for you in the sidebar to the right. They’ll only be there until tomorrow, so get to reading! Also, sign up for our CarterMatt Newsletter if you want to get more of these updates via email.Photo: ABCI agree Cheryl picked. Juan Pablo was just annoyed at explaining again and again that he doesn’t wish to say I love you and propose until he is certain. That is realistic and more respectful to Nikki’s feelings and the whole process of falling in love than others who fake it until they break it in the past.You guys are all stupid. How many times has the bachelor said I love you, proposed and then broke up two weeks later…let’s keep it real people…. Back to Top	Entertainment

			Trending:		Juan Pablo Galavis, the former pro soccer player described by Entertainment Weekly as a “shallow, narrow-minded hunk of man meat,” brought a merciful end to perhaps the most controversial season in the history of “The Bachelor” Monday night when he made his choice between two remaining women.And the final rose went to …Nikki Ferrell, the 26-year-old nurse from Kansas City, Mo.But hold on: Because J Pab isn’t yet completely sure that marriage is in the cards, he decided not to get down on bended knee and fork over the big rock in St. Lucia. Perhaps that will come later.Nikki told El Bachelor how much she loved him and he replied by thanking her and telling her that there are many things that he loves about her.He then recalled how her father told him to be 100 percent sure before issuing a proposal.“I’m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you, but at the same time, I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t want to let you go,” he told her, adding, “I like you a lot. A lot. So Nikki, will you except my final rose?”She nodded and said, “Absolutely.”His decision left Clare Crawley, 32, the sensitive hairstylist from Sacramento, out in the cold — and very, very bitter.After breaking the bad news to Clare (“I have to say goodbye to you”), he moved in for a hug, but she fended him off — a move that drew cheers from the in-studio crowd watching a feed of the finale.“I saved this moment for the man of my dreams,” she said. “I thought that was you. And I thought I knew what kind of man you were.” Then she drove in the final dagger, hissing, “I lost respect for you. … What you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you.” More cheers.After Clare stormed off, El Bachelor breathed a sigh of relief: “Hooo. I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”Classy guy.Earlier in the episode, Clare admitted that she was “falling in love” and said she could envision herself as part of J Pab’s family “forever.”Or not.Actually, there were bad signs for Clare during her final date with J Pab. On a helicopter ride, with the cameras off, she said he told her something “insulting and offensive” that made her feel like an “object.” It was a “sexual thing,” she added. (Apparently about how he enjoyed hooking up with her).Also on Monday, we learned who will be our next “Bachelorette.” During the “After the Rose” special, it was announced that Andi Dorfman, the 26-year-old district attorney from Atlanta will be handing out the roses. She became a fan favorite after she told off J Pab and left the show.Dorfman made the final 3, but decided to leave after her overnight date in St. Lucia, where J Pab told her she made it to this stage by “default.” Like we said, classy guy.Juan Pablo was deemed by many fans to be the “worst” Bachelor ever. During the turbulent season, he stirred controversy by making intolerant remarks about gay people, and he was occasionally rude and dismissive toward some of the women. Many fans considered himself too blunt, too complacent, too arrogant, and worst of all, too boring.During Monday’s finale, even some members of El Bachelor’s family raised red flags about him. His brother, for one, spoke of how he tends to walk away from relationships when things get “rough.”But how do you feel? Do you think J Pab and Nikki have what it takes to form a lasting partnership? And do you believe she’d be a good mother to his young daughter, Camila? Or is there “doom” written all over this thing?Contact Chuck Barney at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.ChuckBarney, or Twitter.com/chuckbarneyMorning Report in your inbox!"	Entertainment

	Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley head to St. Lucia where Juan Pablo Galavis crowns one of them the The Bachelor Season 18 winner.
	Will he actually propose? The Bachelor spoilers have long indicated that Juan Pablo doesn't ask his final female to marry him, and even more spoilers than that indicate that Juan Pablo and his lady haven't even survived through the After the Final Rose ceremony.
	Are the spoilers correct? Let's watch The Bachelor finale and find out...





Juan Pablo and Nikki: Will It Last?


Start Gallery





	Chris Harrison enters the live studio full of people eager to watch The Bachelor finale live. He calls it ""one of the most dramatic and surprising"" finales ever. Just like every other finale. Minus 5.
	""The controversy around Juan Pablo is unlike anything we've ever seen before."" Oh, REEEEEAAAALLLLLY, Chris Harrison. Really. 
	Juan Pablo's entire family has been flown to St. Lucia where Nikki and Clare will meet them all. His sister even flew in from Venezuela. 
	Clare's going to meet the parents first. Juan Pablo says his physical attraction to Clare is ""on fire."" Vomit. Minus 2.
	The only redeeming thing about Juan Pablo at this point is his relationship with his daughter. The only thing.
	His family finds out that Clare's mother is Mexican and everyone in her family speaks Spanish except for her. She loses points in their eyes with that. She totally does.
	Juan Pablo's mom sits down with Clare and Clare tells the Mama that she feels love for Juan Pablo. Then Mama says ""ask me anything"" like she's on Reddit. 
	Clare asks about his personality and Mama says he's hyperactive. That's...not personality? Minus 2.
	Ohhh, there we go.
	""He sometimes is very rude."" TRUE STORY, MAMA. True story. Clare is EXCITED to learn that she's been RIGHT about him being RUDE. What kind of bizarro world does this woman live in?
	Rodolfo, the cousin with the braces, says that sometimes Juan Pablo walks away in relationships when things get rough. Can Clare keep holding on if Juan Pablo is walking away? 
	Rodolfo and Juan Pablo chat and Rodolfo tells Juan Pablo that Clare is basically ""begging"" for an engagement and babies. 
	Awww, Juan Pablo's dad tells Clare that he would love any children she brought to their family and that if Juan Pablo chooses her, she'll have a dad. It's pretty sweet. Plus 10.
	Chris reminds us that this will be the most controversial finale in history and then asks how many people think Juan Pablo chooses Clare. About 5 people cheer.
	And now it's Nikki's turn to meet Juan Pablo's family again.
	There he goes with Camila and his niece again! It's adorable! Why didn't ABC just give him a show hanging out with his daughter?? Plus 8.
	Nikki's nervous to meet Juan Pablo's family again because this time she'll be hanging out with them. 
	Papa talks to Nikki first and she says that Camila has made Juan Pablo who he is today. She wants a relationship with both Juan Pablo and Camila and Papa says it won't be easy. Juan Pablo isn't an easy guy. He's ""focalized"" on what he wants.
	""He think he knew the truth of everything."" Papa gets more points for speaking the REAL truth. Plus 12.
	In her conversation with Mama, Nikki says ""love"" approximately 8 times in 2 minutes. Mama tells Nikki that Juan Pablo is a simple guy, happy to stay home and watch TV on the weekends. 
	Nikki talks to Rodolfo and tells him that she's in love with Juan Pablo. He's asking the tough questions, which explains why he's here. He wants to know, again, how Nikki would deal with Juan Pablo walking away or fighting. 
	""I think we would fight well,"" she says. 
	It's time for the final dates before Juan Pablo makes his decision. He doesn't know what he's going to do, so he starts by taking Clare on a date. 
	She comes running across a field toward him and they take a helicopter ride to see St. Lucia from the air. Or they would do that if they could ever stop kissing. 
	She's ""on cloud 9."" BAAARF. Minus 10. Juan Pablo says she's ""sexy, she's cute, she kisses...hot...aye aye aye..."" Baaaaaarrrrrf. Minus 12.
	As the helicopter is landing, Juan Pablo leans over with no cameras or other people around and whispers in Clare's ear something that she says ""no woman wants to hear."" 
	He says that he really doesn't know her and then says something ""sexual"" that she ""really doesn't even want to repeat."" It's offensive and insulting and she's ""not just an object."" 
	He said ""I feel like we don't know each other."" And that he loved hooking up with her, but not in those words. She won't repeat the words he used. 
	She won't kiss him when he walks into her apartment and instead just asks him to sit. Plus 7
	She's so awkward when she says ""I want to talk to you"" like she's trying to smile and NOT be mad when she apparently really should be mad. It's weird.
	He says that he didn't mean ""I don't know you at all."" What he MEANT was that he doesn't know her enough. He doesn't know either of them enough.
	He says there are parts of her he likes and probably parts of her he doesn't like because he doesn't know those parts yet. She doesn't take that well, but he kind of has a point. He turns the tables and says there are probably lots of things she doesn't know about him and won't like either.
	Clare's ready to walk if Juan Pablo is only in it with her for their chemistry. 
	He tells her that the best thing she ever did was instill the ""no kissing"" rule that lasted from Los Angeles to South Korea, so approximately one week. Minus 3.
	Juan Pablo lists the things he does like about Clare and then tells her he has spent a week thinking about whether or not he can actually propose to either of them because it's about more than just him.
	He smooth talks his way back into her heart. She goes ahead and talks about marriage. Minus 15.
	Now it's time for Nikki's final date. Will Juan Pablo whisper sweet inappropriate nothings in her ear? 
	She walks up in a bikini ready to hop on a boat with Juan Pablo for the day. She's looking for openness and sharing and probably isn't going to get it. She'll get ""honesty"" though.
	Nikki tells Juan Pablo that he's guarded and he says ""no, I'm not guarded."" Minus 8. No one would blame him if he was.
	""What's going to happen when you don't have private islands anymore,"" Nikki asks. ""I'll have a bed and a TV,"" he replies. Oh, okay then.
	She really, really wants him to tell her that he loves her. Until he tells her he loves her, she won't be able to settle down for this date. He doesn't do much to reassure her other than telling her it's going to be okay. But she ""wants forever with him."" 
	She gives him a picture of the two of them and a sweet, heartfelt letter. He kisses her on the forehead and then says he'll see her tomorrow.
	OUCH. Minus 18.
	After he leaves she sits down on her couch and has a good cry. 
	The day has come when Juan Pablo has to make his final choice. The girls are getting dressed in their finest and Juan Pablo looks dapper in a navy suit.
	Oh, look. Posed shots of the women on balconies looking out over the ocean! Minus 2.
	Both women are certain Juan Pablo is going to propose to them. Clare closes her eyes as she rides on a boat and gets her perfectly curled hair completely windblown. 
	""It has to be me!"" they both say! But it can only be one of them.
	Clare gets off her boat first and Chris Harrison escorts her to see Juan Pablo. She says there were times she wanted to bolt and times that scared her to death. But she's standing there right now because they have something special and she believes in him.
	Juan Pablo remembers the first time he saw Clare, when she got out of the limo with the fake belly and says she's there because he wanted her to be there. She's ""unbelievable...such an amazing woman.""
	Then he says ""I wish the earth sucked me today."" (Not gonna lie. I laughed at that.)
	He sends her home as gently as he can and goes in for a hug but she puts her hands up and stops him. She tells him that she gave him an out two nights ago and he didn't take it. 
	""You had every opportunity to tell me how you feel,"" she says. ""Do you know how I feel?"" he replies. ""Do you know when I made my decision?""
	""I don't care."" And then she says she'd never want a man like him to be the father of her children and walks away.
	""I'm glad I didn't pick her"" he says, after she's out of earshot. OMG! Minus 75. (But we're all glad you didn't pick her, too.)
	Now Juan Pablo waits for Nikki with his Neil Lane diamond engagement ring. (It's gorgeous.) She treks across the sand in her high heels and Chris Harrison escorts her in. 
	She's excited for the possibility that she's getting engaged, last night's tears a distant memory.
	Nikki starts by thanking him for the experiences, but she should really be thanking ABC. She wants him to be a part of her life and wants to be a part of his. Nikki can't imagine spending her life without him.
	""Nikki, I love so many things about you..."" NOT THE SAME, JUAN PABLO. Minus 25
	He recalls a conversation with her dad and says he isn't 100% sure that he wants to propose but he is 100% sure that he doesn't want to let her go.
	He gives her a rose instead of a ring. 
	That's a respectable move coming from just about anyone other than Juan Pablo. 
	And now it's time for the After the Final Rose live chat. 
	""Why was 'I like you a lot' enough for Nikki,"" Chris Harrison asks. Hopefully we'll find out at some point in the next hour.
	First we have to talk to Clare. Watching everything back for the first time was hard and brought back the sting of the day Juan Pablo sent her home. 
	Clare is a compulsive lip-licker and I would really like to hand her a tube of Chapstick while also knowing what lipstick she's wearing that it doesn't wipe off with all the lip-licking she does when she's nervous. minus 2
	She admits she should have left after he offended her in the helicopter in St. Lucia but she trusted that this was the real deal. 
	Chris asks if she'd like to confront Juan Pablo and she talks about how laying all of her emotions on the line when she left in St. Lucia was all the closure she needed. She doesn't want to sit on the couch and get fed ""anymore BS."" Plus 48.
	Kelly leans over to whisper something to Sharleen. What did she say!?!?
	Juan Pablo finally makes his way out and Chris asks him about Clare. He just says he made the decision he had to make for himself. 
	Chris asks him if he has any regrets about the way things went down on the show and Juan Pablo starts rambling on about how many hours he spent on the show for it to be boiled down to 20 hours of programming and he enjoyed getting to know the women.
	Chris tries to steer him back to the topic and Juan Pablo goes ""can I talk?"" 
	My eyes just did this: O_O 
	When Chris asks him about the helicopter, Juan Pablo says he won't say anything bad about Clare and that what happened in the helicopter stays in the helicopter. He also doesn't know why he should have any regrets. 
	Juan Pablo leaves the stage and Nikki comes out to sit with Chris. Her hair is looking great. Apparently she and Juan Pablo are still dating and she's still in love with him. But she still doesn't know if he's in love with her. Minus 10.
	She's not going to force him to say ""I love you."" According to her, they're both happy in their relationship.
	Juan Pablo joins Nikki on the stage and she immediately cozies up to him. They've kept their relationship secret for 4 months and now they can go out in public. 
	Chris asks Juan Pablo if he has a big surprise for the night and Juan Pablo says that he doesn't. He talked to the executives and no, he doesn't have any surprises. 
	Chris presses him about the love issue and says she told the world she loves Juan Pablo but he won't say it back. And he won't. He refuses to publicly profess his love.
	I can't decide if I like that he won't buckle to Chris Harrison's pressure or don't like it.
	Sean gives him the side-eye. 
	Juan Pablo is heated. HEATED. He keeps getting interrupted and doesn't like it and keeps shutting Chris down. There might be flames bursting out of both of their ears right now. 
	Chris asks Sean to speak about his experience. Sean was okay giving up his privacy in a way that Juan Pablo isn't comfortable. Sean couldn't wait to tell Catherine he loved her, but acknowledges that different people work in different ways. Plus 2? I think?
	Chris is just hung up on being able to say that Nikki and Juan Pablo are in love. Nikki says this is a real relationship and they're taking it very seriously. Juan Pablo says time will tell for the two of them.
	Finally, they acknowledge that the end result is what matters and they're happy. Two weeks ago their plans changed so now they're starting their future together in a public relationship. Chris keeps pressing Juan Pablo on what the plans are but Juan Pablo won't tell him. Minus 4
	Catherine says this show is about love and tells Juan Pablo not to slap the hand that fed him. Chris tries to host-splain it to Juan Pablo and again pushes the love issue. He says he'd never seen the show before and Sharleen leans over to whisper into Kat's ear.
	Chris congratulates them and then tells us it's time to meet the new Bachelorette.
ANDI DORFMAN!
	She believes she's going to find the love of her life on a reality dating show! Minus 12.
	Chris makes fun of Juan Pablo by asking Andi if she knows this is going to be on television and giving her a pass to express her emotions on this journey. 
	And with that another season of The Bachelor is done! Finally!

	Worst. Bachelor. Ever?
	It all came down to this on ABC's The Bachelor Season 18 Episode 11, the epic season finale, followed of course by the After the Final Rose special.
	We came into this evening with just two women remaining on this ""journey."" Would Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley become the future Mrs. Juan Pablo Galavis?
	That was the question on everyone's mind heading into the final rose ceremony when, as predicted, Juan Pablo chose one woman and rejected the other.
	So who won the final rose? Did he propose? And are they even together?
	Turns out The Bachelor spoilers were pretty spot on here in 2014.
	Not only was the longtime speculation regarding the winner accurate, so were the details surrounding this weird season and how the aftermath played out.
	So who won and who lost (and/or dodged a bullet)? Read on ...
	Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo Galavis left St. Lucia as a couple!
	That's right, she got the rose, but El Bachelor didn't propose.
	Clare Crawley got the heave ho, and Nikki won. But that's it.
	And yet a lot was revealed on the season finale. Namely:

	As for whether Juan and Nikki have any sort of future, that we will have to wait beyond the standard After the Final Rose special filler to truly find out.
	They have no plans, really, to do anything. But stay tuned.
	It's been rumored that Galavis was ""hurt"" after getting dumped by Andi Dorfman and ""doesn't necessarily find his soul mate"" with Clare or Nikki.
	It's also rumored that Juan Pablo went on the show as a giant self-promotional campaign but never had any real engagement or marriage aspirations.
	Think that's true, based on what we just saw play out tonight? Did he lead them on this whole time? Or was he just not feeling these final two? What do you think?
	Also, Andi Dorfman is your new Bachelorette. She's so hot.
	What do you think of the season finale? Was the non-proposal a letdown? Is Juan Pabs the worst Bachelor in history? Share your comments and votes below:

320	It has been an explosive and dramatic season of “The Bachelor.” Juan Pablo narrowed it down to two women – Nikki and Clare – but on Monday only one will remain. Who will Juan Pablo choose to be with? Will Juan Pablo propose? And did he truly come on the show to find love?Meet The ParentsThe season finale of “The Bachelor” kicked off in St. Lucia with Clare meeting Juan Pablo’s family for the first time … and it set off a couple of red flags. At the beginning of their meeting things seemed to be going smoothly with Clare talking about kids and how she can’t wait to be a mother. But it went south when Juan Pablo’s mother told Clare that her son often comes off as rude when he’s being “honest.”Clare brushed off the warning and told his mother that she’s “definitely falling in love with him.” But Juan Pablo’s cousin, Rodolfo, also seemed to be hinting that there could be trouble for the pair down the line.After Clare met Juan Pablo’s family it was Nikki’s turn. Nikki initially met Juan Pablo’s parents and his daughter Camila while in Miami, but their meeting was brief and no one had the opportunity to really grill each other. But just like Clare’s meeting, Juan Pablo’s family seemed to only have warnings for Nikki.“He’s not an easy guy,” Juan Pablo’s dad tried telling Nikki. “It’s always very specific in what he wants.”“He’s the kind of guy you want?” his mom asked her. And when Nikki said yes and asked if Juan Pablo was ready for all of this, all his mother could reply was that she was “pretty sure.”Clare’s Final DateClare has one final date with Juan Pablo before the rose ceremony and she’s ready to make it count. But events occur that leave her struggling with what to do next.Going on a helicopter ride over the ocean, Juan Pablo and Clare are able to have a rare moment together without any cameras or microphones. And while Clare was hoping that he would use that time to whisper some “sweet, kind and loving words,” the exact opposite allegedly came out.“It was just something that he said in that moment to me,” Clare explained to the cameras after the fact. “I almost don’t have words for it, how I feel right now. He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. That he really doesn’t know me, and some sexual thing I don’t want to repeat. It was insulting, offensive and it just made me feel awful.”Clare continued that although she can’t repeat it, Juan Pablo said something along the lines of that he didn’t really know her but loved hooking up with her. His offensive comments left her wondering if all they had was a physical relationship, and desperate for answers before she could move any further.Later that night Clare had the opportunity to explain how she felt to Juan Pablo, and ask him how he truly feels. And while Juan Pablo beat around the bush, he did tell Clare that she’s “special” to him and that he feels “great” about her.Clare drank the punch he was spewing and somehow got out of their conversation that there is more than just a physical attraction between them. “Tonight I know that he wants me here,” she told the cameras.Nikki’s Final DateFor his final date with Nikki, Juan Pablo takes the pediatric nurse on a private yacht for some fun in the sun. Showing up in a bikini, Nikki is set on having Juan Pablo confess his feelings to her. But when Juan Pablo asks if she has any concerns, she doesn’t bring it up.After their romantic date, Juan Pablo visits her at the room. And once again Nikki is desperate to hear that he loves her. But those words never come – even when Nikki gives him a photo and letter. In the letter Nikki thanks him for the once in a lifetime experience, telling him that she can’t wait to see what the future brings them and that she loves him. And all Juan Pablo can do is thank her and kiss her cheek and forehead before leaving … leading her to cry after he closes the door.Juan Pablo’s Decision With ClareThe camera shows a ring in Juan Pablo’s hand … but will he use it? First up is Clare. Arriving by boat, “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison walks her in to see Juan Pablo for the final time.Juan Pablo tells her that since he first saw her – with the fake belly – they have had their ups and downs. “You’re here because I wanted you to be here,” he explains. “You are unbelievable, such an amazing woman … I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along.”HOWEVER, Juan Pablo says that he has to follow what he thinks is best for him. “I will have to say goodbye,” he tells her, going in to hug her. But Clare throws her hands up to put the kibosh on the hug.“This entire time I stuck around because I believed in you,” she tells him angrily. “And the other night on our last date when you came over and we spent our last hour together. I needed that reassurance and I gave you the opportunity right then… and for you to sit there and tell me that you could see yourself in Sacramento.”Juan Pablo asks if she wants to know why he made his decision, but Clare tells him that it doesn’t matter. “I lost respect for you,” she says while walking away. “I would never want my children having a father like you.”And if that wasn’t bad enough, Juan Pablo says, “Oof, glad I didn’t pick her” after she left.Juan Pablo’s Decision With NikkiJuan Pablo has a ring in his hand as Nikki arrives on her boat. The 26-year-old believes that there is a good chance she’ll be engaged by the end of the day … but will Juan Pablo use the ring to propose?“I want you to be a part of my life,” she tells him. ”I’ve never felt like this before and I didn’t expect to feel this way but I’m really glad I do… I can’t imagine spending my life without you. I don’t want it to stop and I don’t think it will. I love you.”Juan Pablo responds that there are many things he loves about her and that’s the reason why he wanted her here. “I could see you as a good stepmom to Camila,” he explains. “You have the qualities.” However Juan Pablo drops a bomb on her – after speaking with her dad during the hometown date, he’s not 100 percent sure that he wants to propose.“Honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket and I’m not going to use it,” Juan Pablo continues. “I like you a lot, a lot. So Nikki – will you accept my final rose?”And while Nikki’s face dropped, she ultimately shakes her head yes and embraces him.Subscribe	Entertainment
321	"TrendingJuan Pablo Galavis dumped Clare Crawley on the finale of The Bachelor, and instead picked Nikki Ferrell. But the moment he tells her that she’s not the one for him, she literally pushes him away and unleashes a fury of harsh criticisms.Juan told Clare that he didn’t have strong enough feelings to propose and her eyes immediately welled up with tears. It was then that she started to walk away and then turned around and began to slam him.






[hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″][hl_ndn videoid=”25699018″]She said that she was disgusted with what he whispered to her when they got off the helicopter and that she gave him every opportunity to tell her that she wasn’t the one for him. Then she said that he wasn’t genuine and she’d never want to have children with him!When she got back on the boat to ride off into the sunset he said he was happy he didn’t pick her. Wow, how rude!The biggest shock was when he picked Nikki but didn’t propose! He said he wasn’t totally certain about her so he gave her a rose instead.This entire season has been emotional and many people wonder if Juan was there for the right reasons.HollywoodLifers, were you surprised Juan sent Clare home?— Chloe Melas"	Entertainment
322	Season 18 of “The Bachelor” has finally come to an end, and the winner is Nikki Ferrell but the pair did not get engaged. In probably the series most awkward Final Rose Ceremony, Juan Pablo revealed that he did not want to get engaged to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse because he wasn’t 100% sure. But he claimed he was 100% that he didn’t want to let her go, meaning that Nikki uncomfortably accepted JP’s final rose with him stating that he did not love her, but instead “liked her a lot.” In direct comparison so Juan Pablo’s lack of emotions, before receiving the final rose from Juan Pablo, Nikki delved into a tender monologue professing how much she truly adored him and admitted that she does love him. Even though it’s becoming more and more obvious that Juan Pablo did not come to “The Bachelor” to find a wife, and a stepmother to his daughter Camila, Nikki unfortunately did look truly in love. She was nervous and could barely breathe as Juan Pablo revealed that she would not be able to call her mom and say she was engaged because he was not “going to use” the enormous diamond engagement ring.As for the Clare and Juan Pablo interaction in this finale episode, the most controversial “Bachelor” shows once again that he is not to worlds most sensitive of leading men. When Clare arrives on the beach to meet with Juan Pablo, he does actually look nervous. While at first we thought that his nervousness was due to his genuine attraction for Clare, but now we are assuming it was more because he had led her on for too long and he was worried of her reaction. Clare’s voice over is actually even sweeter than Nikki’s she discuss her father, who tragically passed, however she is hopeful for what’s to come with Juan Pablo. When she first sees him, she speaks first revealing how she trusts him and believes him, but it seems Clare may have put her eggs in the wrong basket because Juan Pablo does not return her sentiments. Juan Pablo states that she is an amazing woman but that he must say goodbye, her goodbye is much more abrasive and we loved it! Clare looks devastated and doesn’t let him hug her as she turns to leave St. Lucia, but not first without telling him she lost respect for him and would never want to have a father like him for her kids. Juan Pablo reacts in his typical way, by being completely rude stating, “Whew! I’m glad I didn’t pick her,”We are thinking that Clare really dodged a bullet with this one, because Juan Pablo is really proving himself to be rather heartless. We truly wish Nikki good luck however just from the Final Rose Ceremony and Nikki’s clearly deflated acceptance of the rose; we are assuming that the relationship won’t last. Juan Pablo seems to have never really expected to fall in love on season 18 of “The Bachelor.” Donovan Longo, staff reporter, joined the Latin Times team in February 2013 and has quickly become our resident pop culture expert.

323	"CMRMovie Reviews, TV News And Exclusive InterviewsMarch 10, 2014 by oldauthors Leave a CommentImmediately following the season finale of The Bachelor 2014 where Juan Pablo does not present Nikki with the ring or a proposal but the final rose and the words “I like you ALOT” which is enough for her to accept the rose, Chris Harrison brings out Clare to first express her final thoughts and to determine whether or not there is anything she would like to talk to Juan Pablo about.Clare, acting very mature and gathered from her rejection, states she should have followed her gut instinct and left but it was something she wanted so badly only to realize this bachelor is not the man she thought he was or even who he thinks he is. There is nothing left for her to say as the video of that final day is closure enough for her…it is likely that comment he made after she left in addition to her standing up to him which she says was liberating.After the break, Juan Pablo enters the studio in the hot seat expressing relief and stating prayers for what is going on in Venezuela. At the “Women Tell All” Juan Pablo did not have any regrets. Does he now have any? He is defensive trying to get the point “It’s fine” is the comment about Clare and he has no regrets about what he said in the helicopter and glosses over his final remarks to Clare during his goodbye and afterwards but it should be no surprise to the television audience. Juan Pablo has not really taken responsibility for anything adverse this season.Nikki comes out to talk about where things stand with Juan Pablo. She confirms there is a relationship with the bachelor but there is still no confirmation about his feelings for her. For her, it is okay that his actions speak louder than the words she desires to hear. Chris Harrison makes a point about the fact the words have not yet been uttered on Juan Pablo’s part. How long will she be willing to wait?What is Juan Pablo’s surprise? Is he finally going to propose to Nikki or will he break it off with her on national television? It is Nikki onstage with her beloved Juan Pablo. Chris Harrison mentions he stated there is to be a big surprise to which Juan Pablo says it is that they are happy and can now be out in the open after months of waiting for this final show.Chris keeps prying to get the bachelor to open up about his feelings which he continues to run around the bush. Chris asks “Do you love her?” which Juan Pablo remains unable to state the words. Juan tells Harrison he interrupts him as his defense starts to show once more. Shawn Lowe jumps in and states when he knew he was in love with Catherine, he could not wait to tell her with a comment of “to each his own” aimed at Juan Pablo along with the clarifier people handle things in different ways.Chris Harrison does not know what he is looking at; it is a dating situation. Clare defends Juan Pablo and the fact others have been onstage and declared love not there – which is a great point – and the relationship they have is real and progressing at the pace they are comfortable. Should audiences judge with suspicion not knowing what is behind closed doors away from the microphones and cameras?Harrison asks Nikki how long she will wait for the words. She says she will remain as long as it feels right. The relationship changed drastically before “Women Tell All” but it is not elaborated on and plans are to change beginning now but they are not expressed. Juan Pablo is extremely guarded, defensive, and demeaning to the public which is commented on by Catherine who says “Don’t slap the hand that feeds you.”It is confusing and Juan Pablo remains completely oblivious to the dynamics of reality television and delusional, according to Shawn, he is now done with the show and is going to move on with his private life. Who is to be the new bachelorette?

324	"Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis has offended countless contestants this season — and midway through the Season 18 finale the sexy soccer player wasn't changing his tune.Red flags immediately surfaced when meeting Juan Pablo's family. And things quickly went from bad to worse for Clare. First Clare and Nikki got to meet Juan Pablo's parents and family. In speaking intimately with Juan Pablo's mom, dad and cousin they all reiterated that Juan Pablo is not an easy guy, he's hyperactive and that he's often ready to bolt at the first sign of trouble.Juan Pablo's cousin asked both Nikki and Clare how they do with fights, and if they'd stay when the going gets tough. Hmmm. That doesn't sound good.”He sometimes is very rude,” his mother admitted.


After Juan Pablo introduced Nikki to his parents and daughter, Camila, fans started to wonder if the Bachelor had already made his final decision.


JP’s dad agreed, later saying: “He’s not an easy guy … What he wants is always very specific. He thinks he knows the truth of everything.”Nikki and Clare took it all in, but the red flags were clear. Nikki recalled a time that she asked Juan Pablo his flaw and he said ""he's stubborn."" We've seen that all along. But do Nikki and Clare?RELATED: Was Juan Pablo On The Show For The Wrong Reasons?Nevertheless, Nikki and Clare were beaming when they left. And Juan Pablo's family said they could see both women with Camila's dad.Then it was time for Clare's final one-on-one date. She couldn't wait to see him, but Juan Pablo immediately said something that disturbed us. He told viewers he needs to see and figure out if she's the one. Hasn't he had time for that already? Apparently not.


Juan Pablo and Clare had an instant connection.


When Clare and Juan Pablo got into a helicopter to take them for a ride, the producers turned off the audio and video for a short time. Juan Pablo could have taken that moment to tell Clare he loved her or how amazing she was. But instead he told her that he's not sure he knows her very well. He also told her that it's really their chemistry that's incredible.RELATED: Why Nikki Should Have Rejected The Final RoseClare got off the helicopter shocked and confused. She thought they were about to get engaged, and now he was telling her that he doesn't know her very well at all. She also felt like he was saying that this was a physical thing, not an emotional thing.When he came by the house she was staying in that night, Clare had no interest in giving Juan Pablo little kisses (or ""besitos""). She wanted to know what was going on because, she insisted, she would get on a plane and leave St. Lucia if she knew this was just physical for him.


As Juan Pablo and Clare cozied up on a bench in her hometown, she recalled a time that she danced with her dad the week before he passed away.


They sat down on a couch and Clare opened up, asking Juan Pablo what he thought. He said very little, but she felt reassured because he said he could see himself in Sacramento with her. We didn't feel reassured at all.The next day Juan Pablo met Nikki to go on a yacht, and we were getting nervous for her. Nikki said what we already knew: ""I'm crazy about Juan Pablo. .. But the one thing missing from my fairy tale is hearing how he feels about me. Hopefully, Juan Pablo can tell me he loves me.""RELATED: Nikki And Clare Couldn't Stop FightingNikki was visibly nervous on the boat as the sat together and talked. So Juan Pablo asked her: ""Do you have any concerns?""


Juan Pablo, seen here with Bachelor finalist Nikki, defended his R-word joke on Twitter.


""Sometimes I think you might be a little guarded,"" she told the Bachelor. ""You might be a little scared to open up.""Later, Nikki still felt concerned. ""There's a part of me that's a little worried. I get in my own head and question [it]. ... If today was actually my last day ever with Juan Pablo I'd be heartbroken.""RELATED: Juan Pablo Offends With Insensitive TweetsThe next day Clare walked off a boat to meet him. She looked exquisite in a blue gown and admitted that ""it's nerve-racking. ... I've poured everything into this. I haven't been in love since before my dad passed away.""As they stood together, we got nervous for Clare. Whatever we've thought about the woman who lured him to the ocean at 4:00 a.m. this is a hard place to be. And she clearly loved him. But Juan Pablo wasn't feeling it. ""I have to say goodbye to you,"" he said.Furious, Clare pushed him away. ""This entire time I stuck around because I believed in you,"" she told the Bachelor. ""I believed in us.""


Juan Pablo admits that he has electric chemistry with Clare Crawley.


""You know when I made my decision?"" Juan Pablo asked her. We assume the answer was that morning.""It doesn't matter to me,"" Clare said infuriated, walking away. ""I lost respect for you because — I'll tell you what — I thought I knew what kind of man you were. What you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you.""RELATED: How The Fantasy Suite Exposed The Real Juan PabloAfter she walked away, Juan Pablo admitted he was glad he didn't choose her. Then Nikki approached. We had a feeling this blond beauty wasn't getting an engagement ring either.""I want to hear all the things he hasn't been able to say to me,"" Nikki told the viewers. ""I want Juan Pablo to tell me he loves me.""


Nikki Ferrell looked exquisite - and very nervous - as she approached Juan Pablo for the final rose ceremony on Season 18 of 'The Bachelor'.


""I love so many things about you,"" Juan Pablo told her. ""I love how much you care about other people. I love your honesty so much. So much. ... It's been a perfect time every time I'm with you.""But then he recalled when Nikki's father told him he wanted Juan Pablo to be 100-percent sure if he was going to propose to his daughter. ""Honestly, I have a ring here in my pocket,"" he told her.Nikki's eyes suddenly lit up when he talked about a ring. But the glimmer soon faded. ""I'm not going to use [the ring],"" Juan Pablo continued. ""I'm not 100-percent sure I want to propose to you. But at the same time I'm 100-percent sure that I don't want to let you go.""RELATED: Revisiting The Horrible Hometown Dates""I like you a lot. A lot,"" he said.

325	Chris Harrison may be right – Monday’s season finale of Juan Pablo Galavis’s roller-coaster ride as the star of The Bachelor was perhaps the most dramatic yet.  Juan Pablo’s final two women were confident Sacramento-based hairstylist Clare Crawley, who made her strong feelings for Juan Pablo clear from day one, and sweet and sensitive pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell, who wants to be a mom.    So which woman won Juan Pablo’s heart and the final rose? And is there a newly engaged couple in the Bachelor family? Juan Pablo sent Clare home angry and gave the final rose to Nikki – but he didn’t propose to anyone. Here’s how it all went down:   Clare was the first to meet Juan Pablo’s family in St. Lucia – and she earned their approval. His father Saul practically welcomed her to the family, saying, “I love you” in Spanish.   “Juan Pablo definitely has my heart. And now so does his family,” Clare said. “I could 1,000 percent see myself a part of Juan Pablo’s family forever.”   Nikki had already met Juan Pablo’s family briefly at his daughter Camila’s dance recital. But this time they had a chance to chat about Juan Pablo.  “My feelings are so real,” Nikki told Saul, “and I’ve thought about all of this and I feel like I’m ready for it.”  RELATED: Andi Dorfman Is the New Bachelorette!On his final date with Clare, Juan Pablo took her on a romantic helicopter ride over St. Lucia. But the romance didn’t last long.  “What I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth. And I was shocked,” Clare said of Juan Pablo’s private whisper when they landed. “He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. … It was insulting. It was offensive and it just made me feel awful.”  Later, Clare confronted Juan Pablo about saying he didn’t know her well. She said she would not stick around if he admitted he felt their relationship was “just a physical connection.” But Juan Pablo convinced her to stay.   “We have had our ups and downs but I know that she could be the one,” Juan Pablo said. “I just know it.”  For his final date with Nikki, Juan Pablo took her on a boat ride. She also expressed doubts about whether he would make her wishes come true.   “I know how I feel about Juan Pablo. I know that I love him,” she said. “But … I want to hear him tell me he loves me. I just want to hear all the things that I’ve been waiting for him to say.”  When Nikki gave him a letter, in which she said, “I love you,” Juan Pablo did not say anything back. He left for the night and she broke down in tears.   RELATED: These Broken-Hearted Bachelor Contestants Found LoveJuan Pablo’s final decision was not an easy one – for anyone.   “I got to follow what I think is best for me and I have to say goodbye to you,” Juan Pablo told Clare. He tried to hug her but she pushed him away.   “I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you,” she said before walking away. Then she turned and told him, “What you just made me go through – I would never want my children having a father like you.”  “There’s a really good chance I’m getting engaged tonight,” Nikki said on her way to see Juan Pablo, who did pick out a ring with Neil Lane.  But he didn’t use the ring. “I’m not going to give it to you,” Juan Pablo said. “I’m not 100 percent sure I want to propose to you. But at the same time I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t want to let you go. I like you a lot. A lot.”  Then he asked her to accept his final rose. And she said, “Absolutely.”  	Entertainment

329	"So did The Bachelor 2014 end like you wanted it to? Did The Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis make the best choice between Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley? And The Bachelor Season 18 fans want to know if the couple is still together, when The Bachelor Juan Pablo spoilers hint that they might not be. Find out tonight as we join host Chris Harrison and all the bachelorettes here during our live recap of “After the Final Rose.”On the Bachelor 2014 Season Finale, both Nikki and Clare made favorable impressions on their visits to meet The Bachelor Juan Pablo’s family. The individual dates don’t go quite as well, with Clare being offended by a sexual comment Juan Pablo says to her, then with Nikki being concerned about his ability to open up.  Still, after brushing aside their doubts, they both doll up and make their walk with Chris Harrison to where the bachelor awaits. He rejects Clare, turning cold once she tells him how she lost respect for him, and then he doesn’t propose to Nikki but doesn’t want to let her go. So are they dating now or what? We’ll soon see!Tonight on The Bachelor 2014 “After the Final Rose,” we’ll see a number of our former bachelorettes. Host Chris Harrison and The Bachelor Juan Pablo will have a heart to heart about the bachelor’s final two choices, Nikki and Clare. And what big secret will Juan Pablo reveal? Is he still with Nikki? Special guests tonight are Sean and Catherine Lowe, along with Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfried. Has Des yet set a wedding date? And are The Bachelor 2014 spoilers correct in saying that Andi Dorfman may be the next bachelorette? WARNING: BACHELOR 2014 SPOILERS AHEAD!!!This post contains The Bachelor Season 18 spoilers for tonight’s show. Please do not read any further if you do not want to know what happened on tonight’s show.******************************************************Clare is the first to come out on “After the Final Rose” to talk to Chris Harrison. Watching the final episode brings back the sting of that day for her and the disappointment she felt in the helicopter after hearing the offensive sexual comment. Clare feels she wore “rose-colored glasses,” but she was hopeful as she opened her heart. In hindsight, her gut tells her she should have left The Bachelor 2014 after that incident, but she wanted to hold onto that hope. He wasn’t the man she thought he was, she tells Chris, but it was liberating for her to stand up for herself to him that last day in Saint Lucia. Chris asks if she wants to talk to Juan Pablo; no, she had her closure that day. She doesn’t want to be “fed anymore BS.” Chris respects that. She has all the answers she needs.Chris is going to get The Bachelor Juan Pablo’s side of the story. JP feels relief that he’s back in the real world, although he is upset about what is happening in Venezuela. Chris asks him about Clare. He says it was hard to say goodbye to her, but it was the best decision for him. Any regrets? He enjoyed spending time with the women, but he knows people will get hurt. Is he talking in circles again? Chris focuses him back on Clare. Juan Pablo says it was tough. Chris asks if he would have handled the comments in the helicopter any differently. He’s always honest, he says. It’s their relationship, and it’s personal. He has no regrets about what he said. Dang, is he always right? Can’t he just admit that his comments could be offensive?Time to talk about Nikki’s experience and lack of a proposal on The Bachelor Season 18. Nikki says that there is still a relationship, and they are very happy. She still doesn’t know if he is in love with her. He doesn’t say it, but his actions show it. Is she being realistic or naive? She seems happy, though, as Juan Pablo is coming out next. Juan Pablo says they are doing great. He told her dad he wouldn’t propose unless 100% sure, that they would give their relationship a test. Chris asks what his big surprise is. There’s no surprise, JP says, but they are just going to continue their relationship. So no surprise? I feel cheated.How do you feel about her, asks Chris. “I feel great,” says Juan Pablo. No “L” word, I guess. He won’t answer the question. He goes on about how happy they are, and they’re not on the show anymore. Then he mentions how Chris interrupted him last time and then says it again. Is anyone else tired of hearing how “honest” he is, how he uses it for an excuse to be rude? So you won’t say you love her, asks Chris? Sean Lowe points out how he couldn’t wait to tell Catherine how he felt about her once he knew he loved her, but to each his own. Looking in his eyes, it seems he wants to say more but is very tactful.Chris Harrison says this is the time for Juan Pablo to express his feelings. Chris doesn’t know what he’s looking at. He would like for JP to say that he’s in love, but they can’t seem to have a conversation. Chris feels the audience’s frustration. I hear ya, Chris! Let’s dance all around it, Juan Pablo! Nikki says their relationship is real and that time will tell. They’re just taking it slow.Back from commercial. Chris sums up that Nikki is in love, he assumes that Juan Pablo is but won’t say it, but they’re happy. How long would she give him to fall in love with her? She will go until it feels right. Do they have plans? Yes, something changed drastically, says Juan Pablo. But of course he won’t share it. What are they going to do next, asks Chris. They have plans, says JP. Sean says it’s public being on the show, but he wants to keep it private. Sean shakes his head; it’s not private after the show, he says. So do they have plans or not? JP won’t say. An obviously frustrated Chris asks Catherine if she were sitting where Nikki is, would she be happy? Catherine says it’s confusing. She’s glad that they’re happy, but she says not “to slap the hand that fed you.” He signed up for the show to find love, and now he won’t share anything about finding love!Chris says Congratulations but still seems unsure as to what is going on. I feel sorry for Nikki. Is she blind or just not very bright?How’s everyone doing, asks Chris, after the break? “Shower that one off?” He says he doesn’t mind moving on. Yeah, me neither, Chris. Talk about beating your head against the wall when trying to have a conversation. Let’s move on . . . .So who’s the next bachelorette? Assistant District Attorney from Atlanta–Andi Dorman! Her parents are very supportive. She’s excited! She is shaking as she comes out to talk to Chris Harrison. He reminds her that this IS going to be on television, so she can share her feelings, as people will want to go on this journey with her. No doubt! And don’t go for the “I like you a lot.”Andi is dreading having to send people home who are nice and there for the right reason. Chris asks Andi if she’s ready to open herself up to the whole process. Oh, yeah, she’s ready! Juan Pablo obviously wasn’t.That’s it for The Bachelor Season 18 on Gossip & Gab. I hope you have enjoyed this season of The Bachelor 2014.  Keep tuning in for our other favorite reality shows. Bookmark us or friend us on Facebook or Twitter for all our latest updates.

[Warning: Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen Monday night's episode of The Bachelor.]And then there was one.The Bachelor star Juan Pablo Galavis revealed his final pick in Monday night's season finale of the ABC reality series.It came down to pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell and hairstylist Clare Crawley, and in the end, Galavis chose Ferrell.PHOTOS: 19 of Hollywood's All-Time Shortest MarriagesHe did go through the process of picking out a Neil Lane engagement ring. However, in a twist not seen since Brad Womack's first season in 2007, Galavis didn't propose to Ferrell, instead telling her he wasn't sure he was ready to propose but that he still wanted to date her. He also asked her to accept his final rose, and she said yes.Womack, who actually chose not to continue dating either of the final two women in his first season, went on to propose to Emily Maynard in his second season three years later, but that engagement didn't last.Other Bachelor stars who didn't propose include Alex Michel in season one, Bob Guiney in season four, Jesse Palmer in season five, Charlie O'Connell in season seven, Travis Stork in season eight and Lorenzo Borghese in season nine. None of those relationships lasted, either.VIDEO: 'Bachelor' Juan Pablo Galavis Selling Appliances in Upstate New YorkGalavis' predecessor, Sean Lowe, not only proposed to his pick, Catherine Guidici, but the couple were married on live TV in January. That marked the fourth televised wedding in franchise history, following the nuptials of Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter, Jason Mesnick and Molly Malaney and Ashley Hebert and J.P. Rosenbaum.Galavis has made headlines during this season, most recently for retweeting a joke that used the word ""retard."" In January, he also generated controversy for saying that ABC shouldn't have a gay or bisexual bachelor on the show and calling gay people ""more pervert.""PHOTOS: Stars Who've Made Anti-Gay RemarksGalavis, who is Venezuelan and a native Spanish speaker, blamed both gaffes on language issues. He was the first non-Caucasian to star in the franchise, which is from Warner Horizon TV.

331	"Juan Pablo Galavis has spent weeks trying to find the perfect woman to be a stepmother to his 5-year-old daughter, Camila.He thinks he has found her in Nikki Ferrell, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo. El Bachelor — so named because he is the first-ever Latino to star on the ABC reality show — gave Nikki the last rose of the season. But because he's not 100 percent sure he wants to marry her, he didn't give her the diamond ring in his pocket.Juan Pablo sent Clare Crawley, the 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., packing.Juan Pablo ""broke up"" with Clare before giving the last rose to Nikki. Clare was understandably heartbroken and shocked. She said Juan Pablo is not the man she thought he was.She wished that he hadn't strung her along this entire time if he had known his feelings for her weren't there. Earlier in the episode, Juan Pablo apparently said something very insulting to her off-camera, while on a helicopter ride in St. Lucia.As Wetpaint reports, Clare apparently asked Juan Pablo if he loves her.His response? ""I really loved f---ing you."" Clare even repeated the phrase in her reaction to being dumped. That's pretty low, Juan Pablo.Clare said she doesn't even care about his reasons for not choosing her. After she left, Juan Pablo said he was happy he did not choose her.Nikki fully expected a proposal from Juan and seemed ready to accept it. Looks like her own dad's advice — that he shouldn't propose unless he's totally sure — really resonated with her man. It's probably for the best. Do you think they'll actually end up tying the knot? Will Nikki be a good stepmom to Camila? Only time — or the hour-long special following the finale — will tell.Update following ""After the final rose"" special:Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together, but there has been no proposal. Juan Pablo hasn't even said he loves her yet, even though he feels as if he's in love. He seems to have an issue with how public ""The Bachelor"" wants their relationship to be — does he know he was just on a TV show?And Andi, the district attorney from Atlanta, is the next ""Bachelorette."" Everyone seemed happy to have the spotlight shift from the awkward Juan Pablo and Nikki to her bubbly, hopeful face. I thought Andi would have been smarter than to accept such an offer, but when you're desperate for love (and see a gigantic check waved in front of your face), I guess it's hard to resist.

334	"After jet-setting around the globe and doling out dozens of roses, ""Bachelor"" Juan Pablo Galavis gave the last and final rose to 26-year-old pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell over 32-year-old hair stylist Clare Crawley.But Juan Pablo did not propose to Nikki and didn't even declare his love for her.""I'm not 100 percent sure,"" he told her of proposing. ""I'm 100 percent sure I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot.""[Related: Is Juan Pablo Galavis the Worst 'Bachelor' Ever?]Though he had a Neil Lane diamond ring in his pocket, he didn't give it to her.

They are together and she's still in love. As to his feelings? ""I don't know.""When Juan Pablo joined her in the hot seat, he said he was looking forward to starting a normal relationship with Nikki.Host Chris Harrison asked about a ""big surprise"" that Juan Pablo had planned — but the ""Bachelor"" denied any such thing (so, no live proposal). He also refused to say that he loves Nikki.""This is real life. When you are with somebody, you don't say you love her or not,"" he said. ""It's something that you feel.

Their relationship continued to grow after he met her family in Kansas City.Their romance has been unmarked by the drama that characterized Juan Pablo's relationship with the other finalist, Clare. While his chemistry with Clare was off the charts, they clashed after a late night swim that he called a ""mistake"" — leaving her in tears.Then, in the finale, things turned rocky again when Juan Pablo made an offensive, off-camera comment to Clare. She confronted him in the evening, asking if their relationship was entirely physical. He assured her that he liked many aspects of her personality and talked Clare off the ledge.But when it came to proposal day, Juan Pablo said goodbye to Clare. Angry and hurt, she lashed out at him. ""I saved this moment for the man of my dreams, and I thought that was you,"" Clare said.[Related: The Oddest Odd Jobs of 'Bachelor' Contestants]She also accused Juan Pablo of not being the man she thought he was. ""What you just made me go through, I would never want my children to have a father like you.""As Clare stomped away, Juan Pablo let out a sigh of relief. ""Whew, I'm glad I didn't pick her,"" he breathed. (The live studio audience gasped in dismay.)When it was Nikki's turn, Juan Pablo let her know she was the last woman standing, but that he couldn't get down on one knee. She accepted the final rose anyway.""It's OK,"" as Juan Pablo would say.  Paul: I don't like or care for Trump, but this is flat out wrong!!!6k"	Entertainment

""It has not been anyone's favorite, that's for sure,"" an insider told E!Although viewers of the show do not know the final results of the show, there are reports that there have been lots of fighting between Juan Pablo and the winner.""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,"" a source said.The Bachelor host Christ Harrison recently stated his opinion to TV Guide about the former soccer player. ""Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemy. Whether this was a good fit or not or the best decision, I feel like he's fought it. For me, he gets really defensive and short and that's when he says, 'OK' or 'perfect,' whereas normally you'd have a response. He either gets defensive or goes into dad mode and he talks to them like they're his daughter, and says things like, 'Don't be sad,' and touches their hair.""The Bachelor star recently retweeted a fan's insensitive joke last week which sparked controversy.

341	 TV News Catherine Giudici, Juan Pablo Galavis, Sean Lowe, The Bachelor 1 Comment March 10, 2014“The Bachelor” finale is something that ABC has turned into some sort of massive event, as they air it live, and show just about anything and everything over the course of three long hours.On tonight’s edition, this also included a discussion with Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici that could definitely be described as uncomfortable. Why would they even be at the finale in the first place? Obviously, ABC wanted to have a success story there, and possibly a distraction from what was a pretty terrible season.This discussion was led by Chris Harrison, who put Catherine on the spot and asked her what her thoughts on Juan Pablo were. Her response? That she thought he was a “great guy” … and then tried to get some other words together. It’s a pretty bad position to be in for her, since she doesn’t want to completely bash someone on the show. Sean is basically the same way. They’re more ambassadors of good will and peace for ABC, and we have a feeling that so long as they stay married, they will continue to make the occasional appearance on the show to share a few thoughts here and there and updates on their marriage.As for Juan Pablo, we have a much harder time thinking that he will be used for a lot of “Bachelor” promotion. We really doubt that he will even have a wedding special if he makes it that far.Is there anything that you are specifically hoping to see from Sean and Catherine moving forward, and why in the world do you think they were pressed for their opinion on this in the first place? Share some of your thoughts below, and also visit the link here if you want to see the rest of our updates from the finale. We’re also going to have some in the attached sidebar until Tuesday morning, just to make your searching more convenient.Also if you want to get some great TV scoop sent you you every week then just sign up for our newsletter.Photo: ABCI would love to hear a more in depth opinion from Sean and Catherine. Maybe it was just me, but I could tell Sean didn’t care for Juan Pablo anymore. His facial expressions along with his words made it seem that Juan Pablo’s whole attitude (about the current state of his relationship) ticked him off. I personally feel that Nikki is being brain washed to believe whatever Juan Pablo says. Another intelligent woman falling prey to another chauvinistic pig. It sucks I really liked Juan Pablo before he came to be the “main act.” Now I think he is the type of guy that is drawn to whatever “shiny” things are laid before him. The “shiny things” meaning women, just in case that wasn’t clear. Nikki needs to run away from this guy asap. He is living up to almost every hispanic stereotype out there. One other side note I would like to add is that he is always saying “you have to understand english is my second language.” Seriously? You were born in New York! Then you came back to the U.S all be it many years later… but you have been here for a long time now. My mother is a teacher and she thinks he must have some kind of learning disability. People who move here at a young age learn english just fine, oh wait… so do adults who have moved here. Juan Pablo has been here long enough to refine his english speaking abilities, and his understanding of the definitions of the words used in the english language, unless there is a lack of “cognitive” ability there (very likely). Kudos to Charleen and Andi for leaving on their own terms. I find them to be VERY smart women. I am so excited to see Andi find love, and hopefully it is someone who can bring more to the table. Ok.. So I realize I am ranting now, but I hope Sean will share a more elaborate opinion on Juan Pablo and his actions sometime in the near future. Out of sheer curiosity. Back to Top	Entertainment
342	 Reviews Juan Pablo Galavis, Nikki Ferrell, The Bachelor, The Bachelor Juan Review 5 Comments March 10, 2014What a bizarre finale for “The Bachelor” this was, given that there were so many things that really did not make much sense. There was no deliberation from Juan Pablo Galavis on who to pick, a fight between him and Clare Crawley, and also the guy’s family practically warning the women that this guy may not be right for them.Yet, this show has a way of doing funny thing to people. It gets in their head and distorts your opinion. It really makes you think that you are in love with someone who doesn’t really know you that well, and may make you feel better than you would about them in the real world. That is why it is so much easier to feel bad for some of the women on this season.Do we have a ton of sympathy for Clare Crawley right now? Yes and no. While her rejection of him was all kinds of awesome, she did ignore everything that was going on in her head for so long. She’s a victim of her own decision-making, since both Sharleen Joynt and Andi Dorfman were smart enough to walk away when they had a chance to do so. But, this guy was a TOTAL d-bag beyond question when he acted with no sympathy at her getting mad, and then said “glad I didn’t pick her” after she left.This only left one woman in contention for Juan Pablo’s heart, and it was Nikki Ferrell … who we actually felt bad for tonight for the first time to date. She was getting completely strung along most of the episode, and while we understand “Bachelor” protocol is to not disclose your feelings for as long as possible, he could have at least done something more.So did Juan Pablo actually propose to her in the end? Nope! Somehow, ABC tried to make a romantic moment out of the fact that he didn’t give Nikki a ring despite the fact that she wanted one, and he still barely talked about his own feelings. As a trainwreck, this was a big one; but as a romantic experience, what a disaster that was all drawn-out and ridiculous. Grade: D-.What did you think about this episode, and about some of the insane decisions that Juan Pablo made, from the way that he says “honest” all the time to him stringing people along? Share your thoughts with a comment below, and head over here if you want to read some more news related to the show.Also if you want to get more news from us here at CarterMatt then be sure to sign up for our weekly newsletter.Photo: ABCNo wonder the guy is single. I hope his daughter doesn’t end up getting strung along by a guy the same way when she’s an adult…Never watched one episode of this one, but I can tell just by looking at his actions that he is a total d-bag as they say it!  The only person perfect for him is himself!lol that by far was the worst season yet!!! Juan P completely disrespects women, that was clear from day one! He was sickening to watch…a real douche bag… and I hate using that word but it fits..Camila has the worst daddy ever… and homophobic… how can you tell other perverts to others when you are such a douche-bag?I can’t believe that the show even thought of having him as the bachelor in the first place……..

346	"CMRMovie Reviews, TV News And Exclusive InterviewsMarch 10, 2014 by oldauthors Leave a CommentTonight is the season finale of The Bachelor where it will be revealed who Juan Pablo chooses – Clare or Nikki – as well as how it all comes about. Will there be more drama? Is there a twist the television audience does not see coming until it happens? This is what went down on the proposal episode of “The Bachelor 2014” as a live studio audience watches with Chris Harrison~The bachelorettes are to meet the family of Juan Pablo as they all remain in Saint Lucia following the dramatic leave by Andi who called the bachelor out for being insensitive and not really looking for love, but public adoration. As Nikki has already met Camilla and some of the family on a one-on-one date to a dance recital in Florida, Clare will be the first to be officially introduced as the possible Mrs. Galavis.At the introduction, Camilla commands all-encompassing attention as children will in this situation which flowed over to dinner as she sat in his lap. His mother comes right out and asks Clare how she feels about Juan Pablo and how she thinks he feels about her. It is interesting his mother asks about the communication between them commenting on his rudeness that is honest without filter which is exactly how Andi called it.As much as Juan Pablo has trigger phrases, so does Clare with her constant “1000%.” His cousin, Roldolfo, makes the remark to Juan Pablo Clare is “begging” for marriage which is qualified as “ready.” Juan Pablo does not get his communication skills from his father who is really gentleman.The next day, Nikki meets the relatives as she arrives with flowers and a gift for Camilla who is once more attached to her father. Juan Pablo’s father, Saul, is the first to talk to Nikki who comments on Juan Pablo’s self-centeredness with focus on himself. Afterwards, she talks to his mother and states she would like to be a part of the family in addition to explaining how she would spend time with Camilla on the weekends. His mother believes he is ready for marriage but is a simple guy.Roldolfo grills Nikki on relationship dysfunction and whether or not she would walk away  with arguments being constructive. As she leaves, Nikki receives unrequested kisses from the little girls and leaves the family liking both women. Is she the one? Will either, or both women, pick up on the hinting by his family that Juan Pablo may be destined to bachelorhood?There are some alumnus in the audience, including Catherine Giudici (Mrs. Shawn Lowe) and Kelly Travis who both state the women are ignoring the red flags being cast by the family, but in support of the women, Catherine states that at this point, they are not really paying attention to what others are saying but concentrating on their own feelings and relationship with the bachelor. What are the shocking events that make this season more controversial than others besides Juan Pablo’s “lost in translation” blunders?There is one final one-on-one date with each woman remaining and Juan Pablo is not 100% sure at this point which woman he will choose. The first date is with Clare Crawley. It begins with a helicopter ride around the island. He keeps focusing on Clare’s attractiveness and not really her personality leaving one to wonder what is on his mind and when Clare states Juan Pablo whispered something in her ear when they land on a plateau which was other than sweet nothings she expected, makes one think.What was the whisper about? According to Clare, it was the fact he really doesn’t know her and something intimate but not expressed in a way which makes her feel special…in fact, she cannot repeat it! As they walk hand in hand on a small knoll, she lets the audience know the words were offensive and insulting. It is certain the audience has gotten the hint of what the statement was and one which has been coming for a while based on the kind of attraction he feels toward Clare especially since the sneaking into the ocean rendezvous in Vietnam.She feels objectified but should it be surprising? Has she not kind of allowed him to go down that path? She lies on the bed in tears pondering whether his attraction is for a hookup or for marriage. His demeanor is the same as when Andi confronted him two weeks ago as Clare states she wants to talk to him. She asks him what he said in the helicopter and he wants her to remind him setting her on the hook to take the blame once again. He is so superficial and it looks as though Clare might actually be seeing it!Juan Pablo dances around the topic as Clare tries to get him to admit to his feelings about her one way or another. Clare stops him when he makes a statement that it is hard for him to make the decision of whether or not he knows someone enough to propose. Wow! She let him off the hook and it heads to the physical realm as she remains delusional about this being more than what it is. He plays the song they danced to on their first date when she states it should be their wedding song.It is interesting to hear Shawn Lowe speak of Juan Pablo’s tendency to talk in circles without ever really coming out an express honest feelings to anyone.The next date is with Nikki. Will it go somewhat similar to the one with Clare? They take off on a catamaran. Nikki passes off the bachelor’s aloofness as caution. The interaction looks forced and as they lie on the beach, Nikki asks what he will do without a private beach and he immediately states he will have a bed, a television, and his office where he can watch sports by himself. She immediately adds “Not always by yourself” once more indicating these women are receiving huge red flags they constantly disregard.Are these women that desperate for relationships? Are Andi and Sharleen the only two women mature enough to see past the superficial good looks and soothing accent? Juan Pablo goes to Nikki’s room where she is hoping for an “I love you.” She looks confused as he states he is not certain. She gives him a picture of them together on horseback and a card about her feelings. He kisses her forehead but no words are uttered except “I will see you tomorrow.” Heartbreaking! The tears flow as Nikki breaks down.The moment of truth has arrived. Both women are enroute to what they hope is the proposal of a lifetime. Nikki is dressed in a sapphire blue gown matching Juan Pablo’s suit while Clare is dressed in an turquoise green dress. The launch arrives and it is…Clare making the walk to Chris Harrison to Juan Pablo where she rattles on and on without him saying a word which is what he should be doing. He goes into a long drawn out rejection which gains the wrath of Clare which he takes in the same fashion as with Andi. As she walks off, she blasts him with “I would never want my children to have a father like you!”He stands on the platform completely unfazed by the comment to state “I’m glad I didn’t pick her!” Seriously? How callous can one man really be? Clare has justification in stating he should never have told her the things he did to turn around and make statements like he did. Sharleen sits in the audience stunned by what she sees.Will Juan Pablo propose to Nikki? Will she accept if he does? As the show returns from a commercial break, Nikki arrives on the launch, greeted by Chris Harrison and sent to where the bachelor is waiting. As with Clare,, Nikki starts the conversation thanking him for her being at this moment in time feeling the way she does. He cannot say the words “I love you” instead it is how much her loves so many things about especially how honest she is but even though he has a ring in his pocket, he is not going to propose because he is not 100% positive he wants to propose to her but is 100% certain he does not want to let her go as he asks if she will accept the final rose which she does!

LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Tonight, the woman who wins the Bachelor 2014 might not exactly get what she had hoped for. Did Juan Pablo get engaged, who wins the Bachelor 2014 tonight, and is there an After the Final Rose engagement surprise? When you tune into tonight’s Bachelor Final Results telecast, and sit back to learn who is the Bachelor 2014 winner, don’t flip your remote control. Bachelor spoilers before tonight’s telecast tell news that the Bachelor final results for March 10, 2014 may have a bigger surprise in the After the Final Rose telecast than in the Final Rose episode itself.

Details about who wins the Bachelor were revealed last winter. No, Juan Pablo did not get engaged. Yes, Nikki is allegedly the Bachelor 2014 winner. And finally, Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together. RealitySteve spoilers claim that, early on in the season, it was clear that Nikki was headed to becoming the winner. But when Juan Pablo picks Nikki in the final minutes of the telecast, he delivers, at least to her, a shocker. According to RealitySteve, Juan Pablo picks Nikki but does not propose. There is no engagement during the final rose, claims RealitySteve, and there is no engagement in the weeks after that episode aired as well. So are Juan Pablo and Nikki still together? RealitySteve says that Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together officially. But reports have claimed that Juan Pablo has been allegedly dating other women, prompting claims that Juan Pablo was cheating on Nikki. Nevertheless, coming into tonight’s After the Final Rose, Juan Pablo is expected to tell ABC viewers that he is happy that he picked Nikki, and that he was reluctant to propose at that time.Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 3

RealitySteve claims that an alleged “offer” was made to Juan Pablo to propose during tonight’s After the Final Rose. So does the Juan Pablo secret engagement happen, does Juan Pablo and Nikki get engaged in the After the Final Rose tonight? RealitySteve claims to know that the alleged offer has been made but does not know if the alleged offer has been accepted. That will be revealed tonight.Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 4

But before the season started, RealitySteve said “When it’s all said and done, I think you’re going to hear a lot of things come out about this season, whether it be on my site, or in the tabloids, or coming from some of his girls Twitter and Instagram accounts, that presents overwhelming evidence to the fact that this guy …  was never interested in finding a wife”. Juan Pablo has been called the worse Bachelor ever, even though his ratings have been strong. But that could all change tonight with a possible surprise engagement. RealitySteve tweeted moments ago “The first 90 min of tonight’s show is basically pointless. As is every finale. Just get us to the ending since that what it boils down to.”Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 1

So if you already think that this ending is wrong, there’s nothing I can say or do to convince you otherwise. It is what it is.” He adds “Over the next three months, tabloids will run stories, people will email me saying they think I’m wrong, people will have theories on why this happened or that happened. And to that, I’ll take it all in and say ‘Thank you’ and just move on. Without giving up my sources and where I got this info, I can’t convince anyone who doesn’t want to believe it that this is the correct ending.”Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2

                        With Galavis set to choose between Nikki and Clare on Monday night's finale, sources close to the series have begun to air their real feelings about the 32-year-old former soccer player.""He's the worst bachelor ever,"" one show insider told E!

The perhaps most dramatic season of “The Bachelor” is coming to a swift end, and even Juan Pablo is onboard with the season finally ending. Though almost every season has been dubbed “the most dramatic season ever,” this season might actually take the cake over all others.Whether you hate or love the show, it is understandable that all viewers complain about current Bachelor Juan Pablo. Whether it is his annoying idioms, his lack of care, or his emotional detachment from everyone but his daughter, Camilia, it has been perhaps the craziest season ever.Bachelor Juan Pablo’s quest for love ends tonight(hopefully).Image courtesy of Facebook.Juan Pablo announced what everyone in the world is thinking by taking to his Twitter account to write: “The day has COME… Finally TODAY the soap opera comes to an END….”Even the bachelor himself agrees that the antics that have evolved over the season have been a little over the top and is looking forward to the end tonight as he chooses between two girls, Clare and Nikki.Clare has been a frontrunner for most of the season, even though she started off the first episode faking a pregnancy when she stepped out of the limo sporting a fake baby bump in her flowing pink gown.Then there is Nikki, the blonde hair beauty has also been a front runner for most of the season, with Juan Pablo even going so far as to introducing Nikki to his daughter during one of the previous episodes.And the best catch of all? The girls absolutely cannot stand each other, made evident by their ongoing catfights that have ensued all throughout the season.While he has an undeniable connection with both, it will be difficult to guess which lady will end up with the final rose. Will Juan Pablo propose to either of his two contenders? Only tonight will tell in the epic season finale on ABC."	Entertainment

356	"'The Bachelor' star Juan Pablo Galavis made another insensitive and ignorant remark. Get the scoop!The Bachelor star Juan Pablo Galavis must love the taste of shoe leather, because he can't stop putting his foot in his mouth.This time, Galavis' transgression went down on Twitter, where he retweeted an incredibly insensitive, ignorant and, frankly, unfunny joke from a fan.The idiotic missive read, ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I've done. I don’t care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f**king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!""Aside from the obvious -- you know, that it's cruel and wrong to poke fun at the mentally challenged -- whoever came up with this brilliance is also clearly a hypocrite, because most people with an I.Q. in the triple-digits know that ""cupcake"" is one word.Just like he did when he said that homosexuals are ""more pervert, in a sense,"" Galavis defended himself the only way he knows how: By reminding the world that English isn't his first language. Except this time, Galavis also had the gall to say that his critics need to learn both culture and respect. The irony can be cut with a knife, folks:""I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture""""Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES...""""People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM...""""In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect""We're going to go out on a limb here and assume Nikki Ferrell is thrilled she didn't get a ring from this troll. On that note, since even bad things seem to be okay with Galavis as long as they're commonly used, by his logic, my going out to buy heroin with counterfeit cash right now would be totally cool, right?Ugh.

357	"The Bachelor 2014 fans–it’s time for the grand finale of The Bachelor Season 18 as we will finally see who The Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis chooses. The Bachelor Juan Pablo Spoilers may have already given you a hint–if you’ve read any. Will the bachelor choose Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley? Or neither? Stay tuned right here as we see who was sent home on The Bachelor 2014 during our live recap of tonight’s episode.“The Women Tell All” Special episode aired last week, and, boy, oh, boy, did the women of The Bachelor Season 18 really tell all! Many accused The Bachelor Juan Pablo of not really listening to them. Of course, “It’s okay” was the phrase that bachelorette Andi Dorfman got sick of hearing. The bachelor seemed nervous and tried to defend himself; at times I even felt sorry for him. Renee Oteri said she had real feelings for him, but she is now seeing someone! I was impressed that Sharleen Joynt defended him, saying that Juan Pablo did try to get to know her and did ask her questions about herself. Who knows? Maybe it depends on who he was really interested in?Tonight, The Bachelor 2014 will answer all our questions. Well, that’s what we’re hoping for. I’m wondering if The Bachelor Juan Pablo will walk away from both Nikki and Clare. Or maybe he will pick one and then they will be broken up by “After the Final Rose”? What are your predictions?Stay right here as we watch together during our live recap of The Bachelor Season 18’s finale.WARNING: BACHELOR 2014 SPOILERS AHEAD!!!This post contains The Bachelor Season 18 spoilers for tonight’s show. Please do not read any further if you do not want to know what happened on The Bachelor 2014 tonight.****************************************************** Curious about all the tears previewed on this final episode of The Bachelor 2014? So am I, as Chris Harrison enters the room to get us started. Of course it’s “one of the most dramatic and surprising finales,” he tells us as always. He does say that The Bachelor Juan Pablo promises us a big surprise. And we will also address tonight whether Juan actually came to the show to find love. We shall soon see!Time for the girls to meet The Bachelor Juan Pablo’s family in the beautiful Saint Lucia! Clare is excited as she hugs everyone and then meets daughter Camila. She loves watching them together; it makes him even sexier, she says. Clare feels right at home, as they ask her about all the kids she wants to have. She tells his Mom later that she loves him. His mom says her son is hyperactive and can be rude in his communication. Yep, says Clare, he made her cry when they had a disagreement, but they worked it out. The cousin reveals that sometimes JP walks away when things get rough; Clare says she hangs in there. Rodolfo feels she’s sincere as she tears up; he thinks she’s an angel. Hmmm . . . is that a stretch? Dear old dad likes how natural she is and he welcomes her to the family. He will be a dad to her: “Te quiero!” He already loves her? Pretty sweet guy! They love her, but how does The Bachelor Juan Pablo feel?Time for Nikki to meet the members of the family she hasn’t already met. She talks about the amazing experience on The Bachelor Season 18 and how grateful she is. Nikki answers his dad’s questions, saying that Camila has made Juan Pablo who he is today. His dad also tells her that his son is not easy; he is always sure in thinking that he makes the right decisions. Papa feels that Nikki is mature enough to manage his son, and he gives her a big ole smooch! Nikki tells his mom that she’s in love with Juan Pablo. Mama, too, says that her son isn’t easy, but she thinks that he “might” be ready. Red flag, anyone?Cousin warns her, too, just as he did with Clare, that JP walks away sometimes during fights. Nikki doesn’t seem to mind. The family thinks she’s strong. But is she their favorite? The Bachelor Juan Pablo wants to keep both, he says.  Not an option, says Chris Harrison. Not an option.Chris polls the audience. Views are mixed, as some think it will end badly. A male fan thinks it will end well–with Nikki, who seems more comfortable than Clare does. Some of the women are doubtful since even the family isn’t too confident about Juan Pablo. Kelly, from this season, is concerned about the family’s warnings. Catherine Lowe likes Juan Pablo as a person, but he seems complacent with the situation. And there were red flags; there were no red flags when she met Sean’s family.Chris says the last date with Clare is nothing like we’ve ever seen before, so what does that mean? The Bachelor Juan Pablo talks about how difficult his decision will be, as Clare runs up to him. On the helicopter, they make out for a bit. All he can talk about is how sexy and what a good kisser she is. Right before they land–without cameras, Clare reveals that JP whispered something to her. She’s shocked! Huh? He said something that no woman knows to hear–some sexual thing. She said it was offensive and didn’t want to repeat what he said, but it was something about “hooking up” with her. She’s “outta here” if he can’t tell her that he really knows her and their relationship goes beyond a “physical connection.”Clare plans to find out the truth this evening. Sorry, no besito, Juan Pablo, this girl wants to talk. Clare reminds him of the things they have done in private and that he said to her in the helicopter. He had told her that they didn’t know each other; he now claims that he meant that they don’t know each other well enough. He says that there may be other things they don’t like about each other, and he was just being honest when he whispered in her ear. I can see why Clare is confused, can’t you?He does say he loves a lot of things about her, and their relationship is more than just physical. Is he ready, Clare asks? He isn’t sure if he’s ready to propose, but if it’s her, he can see them having a baby in a little over a year. By the end of the night, Clare feels good about him wanting her there. They finish the night listening to their song from their first date.Back in the studio audience, Sharleen says that scene was painful to watch, as Juan Pablo patronized Clare, and she ignored her intuition. Sean Lowe agrees, feeling that the bachelor was talking in circles. For sure!Time for Nikki’s final date. Will she have doubts, too? Nikki shows up scantily clad, as usual. She, too, does want to hear how The Bachelor Juan Pablo feels about her. He denies to her that he’s “guarded,” and they change the subject. Nikki is bit worried about him being able to open up, but, then again, she also feels so comfortable with him. Will she, too, ignore that nagging voice in her head?Nikki wants to find out during their evening how Juan Pablo feels about her. They talk about how it’s almost over. Nikki admits to being nervous. Juan Pablo says it’s all going “to be okay.” Okay, can we think of something original to say? Nikki gives him a gift–a framed picture with a note from her heart. She says she has never felt this way before. She gets a thank you and kisses but no declaration of love. She looks disappointed and sits down to cry after he leaves. Aw, poor girl.And it’s the last day of The Bachelor Season 18. Funny, they didn’t show The Bachelor picking out a ring, even though he’s holding one. Both Nikki and Clare are talking about their fairy tale endings, knowing that the relationship is right. Well, it can’t be right for both of you, ladies, even though you both feel that.Juan Pablo seems nervous to me, as Clare is the first to arrive on a boat to be met by Chris Harrison. She reminisces about her dad and is hopeful for what is to come. She speaks first and tells him how she trusts and believes in him. He then talks about their ups and downs and how they fixed them. She is an amazing woman, he says, but he has to say goodbye. She looks terribly hurt and doesn’t allow him to hug her. (I hear clapping from the studio audience.) She tells him that she needed reassurance that last night. She said that she gave him every opportunity to tell her that it wasn’t her instead of telling her he could see them together and having babies together. She says she lost respect for him and would never want to have a father like him for her kids. Clapping ensues! She meets up with Chris, who hugs and comforts her.“Whew! I’m glad I didn’t pick her,” says The Bachelor Juan Pablo. OMG! Are you kidding me? How heartless! Oh, poor Nikki, if he does choose you! But will he?Nikki thanks The Bachelor Juan Pablo for everything. He’s amazing, as is his family, and she wants them to be a part of each other’s lives. Juan Pablo loves her honesty and how she cares about people. She would be a good step-mom for Camila. He recalls Nikki’s dad telling him to be 100% sure if he proposes, but, even with the ring in his pocket, he is not 100% sure. He is, though, 100% sure that he doesn’t want to let her go. He likes (I don’t hear “loves”) her a lot and gives her a rose to accept. She does. So what does this mean?We’ll see on the  “After the Final Rose” Special–right now! Juan Pablo, Nikki, and Clare will all be there! Join us tonight on  Gossip & Gab for The Bachelor 2014 Recap.

361	Season 18 of “The Bachelor” has been a wild ride for Juan Pablo, but tonight it all comes to an end with the Final Rose Ceremony. After starting the dating competition with 27 women, Juan Pablo has finally narrowed down the contestant to two women, and tonight he will give one of these lucky ladies the final rose and possibly even an engagement ring alongside it. So will it be for Juan Pablo, either Clare, the 32-year old hairstylists from Sacramento, California or Nikki, the 26-year old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Missouri.  Only time will tell, but both of the women have made serious impact on the Latino single father. So much so that Juan Pablo even introduced his daughter Camila to Nikki while the pair were in Miami.But does the family introduction mean that Nikki is the winner of season 18 of “The Bachelor” and Juan Pablo’s heart? Most likely yes- multiple spoiler reports claim that tonight Nikki goes home with the final rose while Clare only goes home with her bags packed. But the one thing we have heard over and over again is that Juan Pablo didn’t actually propose to Nikki, something that according to Wetpaint, ABC wasn’t too happy about. So even though there is a winner in tonight’s “Bachelor” finale, there will most likely be no ring! However, I wouldn’t full rule out Clare just yet. In a deleted scene from tonight’s episode Clare and JP are seen relaxing sweetly together, when the romantic bachelor begins to play a special song for Clare, the moment between the pair is so sweet and tender that she actually starts crying. Then the couple go on to discuss playing the song at their wedding….hmm certainly sounds like she still has a shot at that final rose.No matter who walks away with Juan Pablo and the final rose on the season 18 finale of “The Bachelor” you know it will be an entertaining one! That's why you must watch the finale tonight on ABC at 8 p.m. or if you can’t watch live on the TV be sure to tune in and watch “The Bachelor” finale online available via live stream after the live airing on WatchABC.com!Donovan Longo, staff reporter, joined the Latin Times team in February 2013 and has quickly become our resident pop culture expert.

362	"After a drama-filled but frustrating season, The Bachelor 2014 spoilers for who Juan Pablo Galavis! We aren’t really surprised at who won The Bachelor 18, but you might be surprised at what happened after the final girl got her rose!The Bachelor 2014 Season 18 – Source: ABCAlthough The Bachelor 2014 finale tonight may come to a close with a final in the hands of one of the ladies, that doesn’t mean everything turned out roses for her and Juan Pablo in the end. From the rumors we are hearing out there, no matter what happened on the show tonight, things are not smelling so flowery behind the scenes for the Latin lover and his chosen lady!The Bachelor spoilers source Reality Steve leaked the news quite a while ago that part-time model and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell would be the lady who won The Bachelor tonight. The website also claimed that Juan Pablo Galavis was actually offered money to propose to Nikki on the show because he really isn’t that interested in her, and does not want to get married! But, even with a monetary incentive, did Juan Pablo propose? No way, Jose!Make no mistake about this season, and you can choose to believe me or not – this was a complete cash grab for Juan Pablo,” Reality Steve said. “He never had any interest in finding a wife on this show, or a step mother for Camila, or whatever else line of BS ABC will run at you all season. This guy wants to act, he wants to be in commercials, he wants to model, and he wants to be on ‘Dancing with the Stars.'”Regardless of what happened on The Bachelor tonight, Juan Pablo and Nickki Ferrell allegedly don’t even like each other very much at this point, and have been fighting furiously. Which means the real fun may just come after The Bachelor 2014 finale tonight when host Chris Harrison sits down with Juan Pablo and the ladies. We can’t wait to hear what they have to say about this “shocking ending” to the season!Comments are closed.

You love it, you hate it, you love-hate it. This season, former professional soccer player Juan Pablo Galavis left us cringing more times than ever. And since we all know this show's track record for successful couples, it's unlikely JuanPab and tonight's final rose winner will make it to their happily-ever-after. (Heck, these reports say they're already broken up!)Still, there's something about finding your soul mate by competing with 24 other gorgeous women that hooks us season after season.

LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Will After the Final Rose 2014 tonight on The Bachelor feature a Juan Pablo Nikki Ferrell engagement, does Juan Pablo propose to Nikki on ATFR tonight, and will there be surprise Bachelor results tonight March 10, 2014 on ABC? RealitySteve’s Bachelor spoilers claim that Juan Pablo does not propose to Bachelor 2014 winner Nikki Ferrell in tonight’s finale episode. You allegedly won’t see a Juan Pablo engagement during the final taped episode tonight. But RealitySteve tells news that Juan Pablo might propose to Nikki Ferrell on the After the Final Rose telecast, and there might be a surprise engagement.

After the Final Rose telecasts usually deal with subjects like “are they still together”,” are they still dating”, and of course “are they still engaged”. But RealitySteve recently revealed a shocker about tonight’s telecast. “According to my sources, there is a …. offer on the table for Juan Pablo to propose to Nikki on the After the Final Rose show.”Strangely, RealitySteve tells news that he knows that the alleged offer to Juan Pablo was made but does not know if it was accepted by Juan Pablo. “That fact absolutely cannot be changed. As for what happens at the live ATFR, I don’t know. I know they are still together and they will be together when you see them on the ATFR.” But he adds “Will he propose? Well, the…. offer is on the table for him too. Should be interesting.”Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2

Juan Pablo has allegedly been dating other women since the season wrapped filming. So why would consider to propose tonight? “Does it mean it will for sure happen? I don’t know.”Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 3

Nikki Ferrell Photo 16From there, however, RealitySteve hits Juan Pablo with a series of allegations. Namely, RealitySteve says that Juan Pablo during the season, and in the finale, never wanted to propose to Nikki or any other contestant. “Regardless of if he proposes on the live show or not, the point is… He’s never going to marry Nikki. Nothing has changed with this guy since the very beginning. He doesn’t want to be married to her, he never wanted to be married to her”. Yet, is he correct?Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 1

Means nothing.”ABOUT THIS AUTHOR || Editor in Chief: Maria Stabile | Maria in ten years has propelled LALATE to become a leading news authority in sports, entertainment, and national news, LALATE has been cited in countless international newspapers (including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and LA Times),  international television news broadcasts including ABC News, books including The Iraq War: Origins and Consequences, tv programs including MTV News, and magazines.

365	Since we last wrote about Bachelor Juan Pablo's foray into local advertising, Juan Pablo has starred in four more commercials for Rochester Appliance, the Rochester, New York based appliance store. The last commercial is a dull but very appropriate way to say goodbye to a man we've grown quite weary of.The lovable sassy blonde hoodlum known as Juan Pablo isn&apos;t just making women squeal on The…If you'd like to catch up, here are the three other commercials that have aired in that blissful period between when we first mentioned the ad campaign and today, when we are mentioning it again. If you'd like to catch up on the show that took Juan Pablo from an afterthought to a we're-thinking-too-much-about-him, you've got your work cut out for you. The three hour Bachelor finale airs tonight at 8 pm EST. It will probably prompt reactions like this:Advertisement	Entertainment
366	After weeks of watching The Bachelor Juan Pablo 2014 travel the world and go on dates with the women on The Bachelor Season 18, the end as come and it is time to find out the winner of The Bachelor 2014! We are down to Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell and one of them will walk away with the final rose on The Bachelor 2014 finale, but which one? Find out who won The Bachelor 2014 tonight during our The Bachelor Juan Pablo 2014 Spoilers Recap!Last week on The Bachelor Season 18, we took a week off from all the action during the taping of the season and had the Women Tell All special. The eliminated women on The Bachelor 2014 took to the stage to sit down with Bachelor host Chris Harrison to dish on things we didn’t see. What didn’t we see? Well, it seems like all of the women were not impressed with Juan Pablo and how he did not seem genuine in wanting to be there! Jilted exes? I would say the very least. It got harsh at times and I almost felt bad for Juan Pablo, which is hard for me to even type![PHOTOS: Click here for finale sneak peek photos!]The fun begins shortly on The Bachelor 2014 Finale, so follow along with our recap below!WARNING: THE BACHELOR JUAN PABLO 2014 SPOILERS AHEAD!Don’t want to know what happened on our The Bachelor Juan Pablo 2014 Spoilers Recap or see who won The Bachelor Season 18 tonight? Then don’t look ahead!!!****************************************************************[Please refresh this page frequently for the latest updates in our The Bachelor 2014 recap]Here we go…I guess we start tonight with a look back at Juan Pablo and Andi? Why are we living that back? We have Chris Harrison in the studio with some familiar faces and we are live!We head out to St. Lucia and time for the final two women to meet Juan Pablo’s family. His family is all there and his niece and daughter. Up first tonight is Clare! He said they had a misunderstanding in Vietnam, but he is keeping his eye on her today and how she is with his family! Clare said they made her feel so comfortable and welcome and they were so loving and she loved seeing him be a Daddy to his daughter.She sits down with his mother and she said their communication is great and had a misunderstanding, but they worked and talked it out. She said he is honest and it can hurt sometimes, which I guess goes back to Juan Pablo. She sits down with his cousin and said she is falling in love with him and has been and only says it when she means it.Juan Pablo now sits down with his cousin and he said Clare is in love. He said she is willing to work with you and if Juan Pablo finds a potential wife then go all in. And Juan Pablo’s father loves Clare and tells her. Clare thinks anyone would be so lucky to be a part of this family. Clare and Juan Pablo talk and she knows he was raised correctly and you could tell that with his family. She said it is getting harder and harder to say goodbye to The Bachelor Juan Pablo 2014. He has her heart and so does his family now!Chris Harrison plugs After The Final Rose, as Juan Pablo promises their is a surprise tonight! Does he propose???Now it is time for Nikki to meet Juan Pablo’s family on The Bachelor 2014. She has met some of them, but here we go again! Nikki gets there and talks about their journey on the show and where they have been. It appears that Juan Pablo’s Dad is easy-going, as he seems to love both girls. She tells his Mom that he is the kind of guy she wants and tells her she is in love with him. His Mom thinks he may be ready for this. She talks to his cousin and thinks Juan Pablo is passionate and if they fight and how would it be. He was hoping to have a better understanding of who he should pick, but he thinks Juan Pablo has a tough choice to make!Juan Pablo said his family enjoyed both of them and he can see it with both of them and wonders if he can keep both of them! Chris Harrison said that is not an option!We get some words from the audience about who they think Juan Pablo picks and then we chat with Sean and Catherine Lowe about Juan Pablo and she said he is a good guy, but she can understand where the women on this season are coming from because he has a weird way of showing his passion.Back to The Bachelor 2014 finale and it looks like we have one more date for both the ladies. Is this normal? I was wondering why things were moving so quickly! Clare is up first and they are boarding the helicopter for a ride! He is holding her close and kissing on the helicopter ride. There is a rare moment on the ride and there are no cameras and audio as it lands and Juan Pablo whispers in her ear something, but it is something sexual and she is pissed! She is feeling disrespectful and wants him to now say there is something more than a physical thing or she is out of there!Time for the evening portion of things and Clare is not happy. She wants to be more than a hookup, but not telling us what exactly Juan Pablo said! He said she doesn’t know him and he doesn’t really know her. She calls him out on it and needs to know if it is more than a physical thing. He gets so awkward when he is confronted about things and said he is being honest, yet again. He said there are things she might not like about him and things he might not like about her. This is beyond awkward!He tries to explain that he can see himself with her. He said this is hard and it is a proposal for him and his daughter and he has been going over this in his head. He is struggling and she said this is what she wants to hear and not that he likes kissing her. He mentions having babies with her and he feels great. She said it was important for her to tell him how she feels and it hurt today. I guess she now feels there is more than a physical attraction and she should be there. He said he likes her a lot and she knows they have something special.Now it is time for Nikki and her date with Juan Pablo on The Bachelor 2014. They head out on the boat and are talking about the time with his family. She tells him that he may be guarded at times, but he said when he feels it he will open up. She is getting in her own head and thinking too much, but she thinks they have something special and he can’t have that with anyone else.The evening portion has arrived and she just wants to hear him say that he loves her and wants to know it is her who he picks! They talk about the journey and we have some awkward silence. She didn’t think she would be this nervous tonight, but he said it is going to be okay. She said she has never been with someone where it felt so right and wants forever with him. She gives him a present and she sits waiting for him to say “I love you” and no luck for her as he heads out! And Nikki sits and cries, as now she is wondering where his head is at.The time has come on The Bachelor Juan Pablo 2014 and he will make his final choice! The Neil Lane ring is in place and the ladies are getting ready! They both think they could leave her engaged, but one of them will not and they both possibly could! The boats are heading to the spot and Juan Pablo is in place and up first is Clare, who is escorted to Juan Pablo by Chris Harrison. Winner or loser going first?He sits there in silence, so she starts talking and talking….shut up, girl and let him say his peace and you won’t look like an idiot! He tells her they have had their ups and downs and he wants her to be there and this is the hardest decision ever. He said he has been honest from the beginning and he has to follow what he thinks is best for him and he has to send her home! He goes to give her a hug and she stops him!!! She said she needed reassurance from him the other night and thought she knew him. She lays it into him and it is not pretty! She said she would never want her children to have a father like him and walks off. That just got real and when she is gone, he says he is glad he didn’t pick her! Who wants to slap him??? I’ve never been a fan of Clare this season, but I am Team Clare right now!Now it is time for Nikki to go in front of The Bachelor Juan Pablo 2014 and see if he gets down on one knee with that rock. She thanks him for this experience and wants him to be a part of her life. He tells her that there are so many things that he loves about her and she is like him with the honesty. He has a perfect time every time he is with her. He said he has a ring in his pocket and he is not going to use it. He is not 100% sure if he wants to propose, but he is 100% sure he doesn’t want to let her go. He gives her the final rose and she accepts!>>>CLICK HERE FOR OUR RECAP OF THE AFTER THE FINAL ROSE SPECIAL!!!Join us tonight on Reality Rewind for our The Bachelor Juan Pablo Spoilers 2014 Recap.

369	"2014's Season 18 Bachelor finale premieres in just a few hours, but does Juan Pablo really know who the ladies are. Speculation as to whether or not Galavis is going to propose and to whom abounds, but the former soccer player is right to be nervous. Evil contestant Claire Crawley hasn't been entirely truthful about her restraining order past. Spoilers: Claire's dubious double-dealing with men has got her into a lot of hot water at least once before.Juan Pablo was dealt quite an unexpected blow, when two of his favorite ladies decided he wasn't for them, instead of the other way around.The rejections have fueled intense speculation that Juan Pablo will probably not propose to either one of tonight's finalists.While it isn't at all clear who Juan Pablo is leaning towards, it's pretty certain that the ladies from the show don't want to see cruel Claire Crawley win.A show insider tells Star that Crawley worked hard at making sure she alienated every single woman and the show:""From dominating Juan Pablo's time, even during group dates, to unfairly sneaking away for an unscheduled midnight swim with him in the ocean, Claire clearly was the gal that the other women loved to hate this season.""She tried to play innocent afterwards but it didn't wash.""Not surprisingly this isn't the first time that Ms. Crawley has got on the bad side of a lady by acting sketchy around a man.Back in August of 1999 Claire had to turn to Sacramento County according to Star to protect her against a group of women that were looking to settle a few scores.In the order of protection filed by Claire, she alleges that ladies called her ""a f***ing sl*t"" a well as threating her physical person:""Claire claimed that Jennifer, sometimes accompanied by a group of friend, has 'threatened to physically harm me', and had stated she would 'hunt me down and beat the s**t out of me.""One can only surmise since Claire hasn't learned her lesson, Jennifer never was able to catch up with her.About the AuthorTags2014, Season 18, Bachelor, Juan Pablo, finale, Spoilers, Claire Crawley"	Entertainment

LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Are Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo still together 2014, are Nikki and Juan Pablo still dating, what happened between Nikki and the Bachelor, and will there be no Nikki Juan Pablo engagement tonight? RealitySteve Bachelor 2014 spoilers claim that Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo are still together, they are still dating 2014, but that they do not get engaged in the finale episode tonight on ABC. The question is whether Juan Pablo will propose to Nikki on After the Final Rose.

Nikki and Juan Pablo were together, and dating, right after tonight’s episode was filmed. But there might not be anything more to that. RealitySteve tells viewers that false tabloid reports have been heating up this month. RealitySteve suggests in his spoilers that are not any real surprises tonight. The episode was filmed without much drama. Juan Pablo didn’t choose Clare. And while Nikki was expecting a ring, she does not get one. “The overnight date portion of this season took place at or near Sugar Beach, which was where the rose ceremony was. Then for the final rose ceremony which took place Tuesday, November 12th, I originally reported it was going to be at The Landings resort.” RealitySteve adds “That was mistaken. The final rose ceremony took place at or near the Cap Maison Hotel. Both Clare and Nikki showed up, he didn’t send one home early or anything like that. And in the end. Juan Pablo chose Nikki, but he did not propose”.Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2

But RealitySteve claims an alleged motive by Juan Pablo. He asserts that Juan Pablo allegedly never wanted to propose to any of the women in this case. “However, for Juan Pablo, I’d say it’s more about him never wanting to propose to any of these girls in the first place before he even started this journey.”Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 4

It’s all smoke and mirrors.” He adds “I’ve said it since November 20th, and I’ll say it again: Juan Pablo chose Nikki at the end but didn’t propose to her.”ABOUT THIS AUTHOR || Editor in Chief: Maria Stabile | Maria in ten years has propelled LALATE to become a leading news authority in sports, entertainment, and national news, LALATE has been cited in countless international newspapers (including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and LA Times),  international television news broadcasts including ABC News, books including The Iraq War: Origins and Consequences, tv programs including MTV News, and magazines.

371	"  When the finale of a ""Bachelor"" or ""Bachelorette"" season rolls around, fans are usually excited to find out who the lead ends up with.For Juan Pablo Galavis, however, there's a collective shrug about his choice between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell. The buzz on Twitter is that he’s the ""worst 'Bachelor' ever."" The women on the show didn’t like him. Even the show’s producers are totally over him.[Related: Juan Pablo Has Some Not-So-Nice Thoughts About a Gay 'Bachelor']""Everyone is definitely ready for Juan Pablo's season to be over. Producers felt like they were putting out fires left and right with him, starting with the gay comments,"" an inside source told Yahoo TV. ""He used the 'second language' excuse a lot, no one is really buying it. Two girls chose to leave in the top six. When has that ever happened before? That should be indicative of what we were working with.""[Related: 'The Bachelor': Was That the Awkwardest Kiss Ever?!]How far Juan Pablo has fallen! When he was chosen to be the ""Bachelor"" in August after vying for Desiree Hartsock’s heart on ""The Bachelorette,"" his adoring public couldn’t stop gushing over his abs, his sexy accent, and his tender love for his daughter. At the ""Men Tell All"" taping, female audience members screamed ""JUAN PABLO"" so loudly, they could practically be heard in the next state.Fast forward half a year, and he's generating comments like this:Juan Pablo is honestly the worst bachelor they have ever chosen; he has noo personality, he's rude, & he has bad taste In girls #sendHIMhomeLet me speak for every woman in the United States, Juan Pablo is the absolute worst bachelor.Spoiler alert, Juan Pablo falls in love with himself. It took him the whole season but he now realizes he is the best thing for him.I mean. Juan Pablo is really the worst.It all began early in the season, when Juan Pablo made remarks against having a gay ""Bachelor."" He apologized for the derogatory comments, but they ignited a controversy that the show still hasn’t escaped.Then he displayed hypocritical behavior — sometimes he would hold off on kissing women out of ""respect"" for his young daughter, Camila, while other times he would make out with one contestant in front of the others.[Related: A 'Bachelor' Finalist Leaves After Disaster Fantasy Suite Date]The most egregious example was when he ""slut-shamed"" finalist Clare, who asked him to join her for a late-night swim in the ocean. The next day, he essentially blamed her for putting him in a situation that was ""disrespectful"" to his daughter.And, as our source noted, two of the top six women left early by their choice. Andi Dorfman departed after a ""disaster"" fantasy suite date. She accused Juan Pablo of being self-absorbed and never asking her questions about herself. The recent ""Women Tell All"" episode confirmed that hardly anybody seems to consider Juan Pablo a good catch. They eviscerated him for using the ""language barrier"" and his daughter as excuses for his conflicting, hurtful behavior.We don’t know whether to congratulate or feel bad for whichever of the final two women, Nikki or Clare, wins... if you can even call it winning.""The Bachelor"" finale airs Monday, March 10 at 8 p.m. on ABC.Paul: I don't like or care for Trump, but this is flat out wrong!!!6k"	Entertainment

Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis will bestow his final rose to one of the two remaining contestants on ABC's ""The Bachelor"" tonight. While I'm guilty of getting sucked into the reality show, some weeks (especially this season) the show's biggest draw is the excuse it provides to invite friends over and mix a few cocktails while watching. That inspired me to find some rose-themed cocktails for tonight's season finale.Rose syrup is a extra-sweet variation on simple syrup that's infused with rose petals. It can add a mild floral taste and light pink hue to a drink, depending on how much you use. It's also quite easy to make at home – just boil sugar and water, then simmer lightly with rose petals and let it infuse for a couple hours.You can use rose syrup as a sweetener in myriad cocktails. In fact, it adds a nice touch to even standard recipes like margaritas (see my version below). That's the beauty of infused simple syrups – they're an easy way to add a fresh touch to otherwise familiar drinks.Below are three rose syrup cocktails perfect for sipping while seeing who Juan Pablo picks – or on any other occasion, for that matter.Pulitzer Prize-winning multimedia journalist Alison Sherwood is the web producer for the Journal Sentinel's lifestyle section, Fresh.© 2016, Journal Sentinel Inc.

Reduce the heat to low, add the rose petals and simmer very gently for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally (do not boil).Remove from the heat and let cool 2-3 hours to allow the flavors to develop. Strain through a fine mesh sieve, then bottle.This twist on a traditional margarita has a bright, light floral flavor.1 ounce tequila

373	"FOLLOW:Tonight, on ABC’s The Bachelor, either Clare Crawley (a 32-year-old hairstylist) or Nikki Ferrell (her 26-year-old pediatric nurse adversary) will accept a final rose from Juan Pablo Galavis. Both women are blonde, petite, eager to please, and “ready for real love”; both have spent ten weeks enduring tears, group dates, and countless bikini-clad make-outs on international beaches in order to reach this moment.But — regardless of whom Juan Pablo selects as rose recipient and future bride — neither will actually win, and that’s because Juan Pablo is the worst. The only winners here are viewers: It turns out having a terrible bachelor makes The Bachelor much more interesting.Throughout The Bachelor’s 18 seasons, the contestants have tended to be objectionable only in their homogeny: Typically the men are low-budget Disney princes — all doofy, affable, white bros with square jaws, whose top interests include making out and not wearing shirts. This season, ABC selected a “fan favorite” from season nine of The Bachelorette. Juan Pablo is a 32-year-old American-born Venezuelan former professional soccer player with a faux-hawk, a six-pack, an accent, and a young daughter. He’s the show’s first single father and first “minority.”He also turned out to be a PR disaster. First he raised eyebrows after he declared that there should not be a gay Bachelor, using the word “pervert” in his explanation. Then, he slut-shamed a contestant (the finalist Clare) after their illicit on-camera sexual encounter. Most recently, he mocked the mentally disabled in a tweet. (“’Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy!”) For these offenses, he’s been vilified on social media and celebrity-news outlets. ABC had to release a statement apologizing for  his “careless, thoughtless and insensitive” comments, and he’s already lost his post-Bachelor gig on Dancing With the Stars.Yet Juan Pablo’s unpleasantness goes beyond those obvious debacles. On the show, he’s creepy, manipulative, inattentive, and disingenuous; once, he took a woman on a date to some kind of EDM rave. He speaks to grown women with the same cadence he probably uses with his kindergarten-age daughter. He barely asks the women questions about themselves, and if they display any genuine emotion or bring up “relationship issues,” he turns into a vacant, blinky toddler. He responds to such overtures with a patronizing “okay, okay” or perhaps “you’ve been doing some thinking,” then proceeds to initiate a make-out.And while The Bach has always involved a strong undercurrent of Madonna-whore complex, Juan Pablo has made it more apparent than ever before. On group dates he’ll dry-hump one woman in a hot tub while the others look on, then turn around and tell other women he won’t kiss them because he has a daughter and must be careful. Fatherhood — the very thing that must have made him look like an appealingly domestic Bachelor candidate — has actually made him seem even more despicable, since his child is most often treated as currency to help him get what he wants out of women.After the slut-shaming incident, Willa Paskin, writing for Slate, declared that the episode exposed the show’s weird attitudes toward sex. She wrote:  “The Bachelor continues to present itself as romantic, out to find a good man a life partner, a soul mate, a true love — all while behaving like a pimp.” As Paskin points out, Juan Pablo’s antics have made the show’s strangeness fascinatingly apparent.What’s more, though, it’s given the show’s women the chance to reveal themselves in ways the women of previous seasons have not. The franchise has consistently portrayed women as googly-eyed idiots willing to swallow bland bromides while tearing each other down. This season, the women (and the viewers) are calling bullshit, and it’s miraculous. As a result, we’re finally seeing defiant, distinct personalities, not just the 21-year-old pharmaceutical sales reps who don’t know any better than to get caught up in a highly choreographed, department-of-tourism-friendly, margarita-drenched fairytale . Everyone knows what early-date infatuation looks like, but what about disillusionment? Or indignation? Or righteous refusal to put up with a total buffoon?Take, for example, Sharleen Joynt, a 29-year-old opera singer from Germany who was sophisticated, sexually experienced, and relatable. When she chose to leave the show of her own volition, she commented on why she and Juan Pablo hadn’t forged a connection: “I wish I was more dumb,” she said in her farewell monologue.Another contestant, Andi Dorfman, preemptively dumped Juan Pablo: She couldn’t abide his general shallowness after their overnight date in Saint Lucia. For the uninitiated, an overnight date includes an invitation to the Fantasy Suite — where the final contestants get the chance to spend a one-on-one night in a hotel room with the bachelor and without cameras, for a night of “whatever.” Historically, the contestant will walk out the next day glowing with post-coital bliss, jabbering on about having the best night of their life and how they have never felt more complete or connected or certain that this man (who is scheduled to hump two more women in succession in that same suite) is THE ONE.Dorfman, a feisty 26-year-old assistant D.A. from Atlanta, emerged from the suite with a forced smile, a chilly peck, and declared it “the worst date she had ever been on.” She added that Juan Pablo had spent a considerable amount of time bragging about his previous night with Clare. Subsequently, after Dorfman was informed that she had “barely made it to the final round,” she told JP he was an asshole and left the show. Twitter erupted in support.It wasn’t just Joynt and Dorfman, though: It was all of this season’s women. The “Women Tell All” episode is normally framed as a chance for jilted lovers to air their drama and feuds with each other. But last week’s episode marked the first time in the history of the show that the women were more like a support group, with the man as a recipient of seething hatred. (In part, this was probably a way for the producers to address the anti–Juan Pablo sentiment on social media.) Among their complaints: that it was “obvious he didn’t care about me,” that he played blatant favorites, that he neglected some women and was, in general, a selfish prick. With a common enemy, the contestants were unified: “We came here for a husband; he came here to find a girlfriend,” one contestant said. And, in an unexpected twist, the women even began defending each other, e.g., collectively reassuring single mother Renee that Juan Pablo respected her. They formed a weird sisterhood of those who had survived a brief encounter with Juan Pablo.It almost made you feel bad for the guy, who sat sweating, blinking vacantly, unable to really defend himself without looking like an even bigger jerk. Almost. Because finally, after 27 seasons of the artifice, sunsets, and evening gowns, viewers got to see what actually happens when The Bachelor is vulnerable and exposed — it wasn’t pretty, but it sure made for good television.

376	Tonight’s finale of “The Bachelor” will finally conclude the sad chronicle of Juan Pablo on season 18 of ABC’s hugely popular series. Even though we haven’t yet watched the final rose ceremony, multiple spoilers reports claim that this season’s front runner did not end up winning Juan Pablo’s heart, instead Nikki Ferrell home the final rose. So why after several one on one dates, steamy make outs and, of course, their infamous moonlight ocean dip did Juan Pablo not choose Clare Crawley as the season 18 winner? Well because there are many more factors at play involved in choosing the final lady then just the amount of time JP and Clare spent together.The main reason as to why Clare will not win Juan Pablo’s heart is mainly because Clare was too smart for her good, and unfortunately treated the dating competition as just that— a competition. Clare knew exactly how to get Juan Pablo’s attention, not because he was actively seeking her out, but more due to the fact that Clare knew how to put himself on his radar at every opportunity.  Some simple examples of Clare’s tactics include her refusal to eat the octopus and then only tasting it “for him,” or the more well known and controversial ocean swim that led to Clare and Juan Pablo engaging in the earliest intimate night in the history of “The Bachelor.” Even though Clare was on the receiving end of most of Juan Pablo’s attention, she never really got to know him instead continually one-upped her fellow contestants.Even when they attempted to further their relationship, it was all based on psychical attraction rather than an emotional connection. Like Sharleen who notably eliminated herself from season 18, Juan Pablo and Clare have a serious magnetism to each other but it seems like that wasn’t enough for JP to choose to spend the rest of his life with her. More over the most important piece of evidence indicating that Nikki will receive JP’s final rose instead of Clare, is Camila. Juan Pablo introduced his young daughter to Nikki in Miami, and that is most likely the most important clue into telling us whom JP truly cares for.  Donovan Longo, staff reporter, joined the Latin Times team in February 2013 and has quickly become our resident pop culture expert. As a native New Yorker and Fordham University alumni, Donovan has always had her finger on the cultural pulse and is here to get you in the know.  As a follower of Donovan’s writing you will undoubtedly win a game of thrones, survive a zombie apocalypse, fall in love with a vampire and outsmart the CIA. © 2018 Newsweek Media Group All Rights Reserved	Entertainment

LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Who win the Bachelor 2014? Last fall, RealitySteve’s Bachelor 2014 spoilers announced who Juan Pablo picks. Final results for The Bachelor tonight March 10, 2014 reveal if the Bachelor 2014 winner is in fact just as RealitySteve predicted, and if Juan Pablo makes his pick consistent with months of RealitySteve spoilers.

 Tonight the mystery over who wins the Bachelor 2014 is resolved. And if Reality Steve’s spoilers are correct, tonight ABC viewers will watch the Bachelor 2014 name Nikki Ferrell as your winner. The question remains, however, what happens thereafter. Details about why Juan Pablo picks Nikki, how he picks Nikki, and more important, what happened to Juan Pablo and Nikki after filming ended, remain uncertain.RealitySteve tells news today 3/10/14 that viewers should ignore tabloid reports about Juan Pablo. Does Juan Pablo live with his parents, is Juan Pablo broke, and does Juan Pablo deliver an engagement to Nikki in the finale tonight? For several seasons, tabloids have historically delivered fake spoilers in advance of the finale. These “faux spoilers”, as LALATE called them last year, involve tabloids telling readers that they have juicy spoilers about the season finale, when in fact the tabloids know that the spoilers are actually untrue.Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 1

However, RealitySteve has been telling readers allot lately that “it means nothing.” But has not yet clarified what he means. For example, on Monday he tweeted “As four tonight spoiler, nothing has changed since St. Lucia. Ignore the tabloid reports. Juan Pablo. & Nikki still together, even though it means nothing.”Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2

Last season on the Bachelorette, it appeared in the penultimate episode that RealitySteve’s spoilers were going to be wrong. Reaction heated Twitter the night of that episode. But RealitySteve defended his predictions. In the end, his Bachelorette spoilers were wrong. And yet, Steve has never truly told viewers how, where and why those spoilers turned out to be wrong, very wrong.Nikki Ferrell Pictures Set 3

So far Juan Pablo has appeared on several magazine covers being called the worse Bachelor ever. That type of reaction was predicted by RealitySteve last winter. “But this notion that this is the best Bachelor they’ve ever had and what a great season it’s going to be is all propaganda. In the end, a guy who didn’t care from the beginning picked the girl that no one liked …..Their dream is going to be crushed.”ABOUT THIS AUTHOR || Editor in Chief: Maria Stabile | Maria in ten years has propelled LALATE to become a leading news authority in sports, entertainment, and national news, LALATE has been cited in countless international newspapers (including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and LA Times),  international television news broadcasts including ABC News, books including The Iraq War: Origins and Consequences, tv programs including MTV News, and magazines.

378	"If you thought the Women Tell All special was harsh on Juan Pablo Galavis, wait until you hear this. E! News reports that it's not just his castoffs that despise him. Crew and producers apparently hate him too. According to a source, ""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over. He's the worst Bachelor ever."" Oh how the hunky have fallen. The biggest issue seems to be his anti-gay comment some weeks ago. He happened to make the gaffe during the same weekend as Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding and they worried that it overshadowed the blessed, made-for-TV event. As if anything could take attention away from the fact that the walking Ken Doll and his pick were finally gonna do it. They also took issue with him jokingly using the R-word in in a tweet. But I say poor Juan Pablo deserves a break. Check out the 5 reasons he isn't as bad as all the haters say.What do you think of Juan Pablo? Is he really as bad as they say? Image via ABC

	ABC's ""Bachelor"" fairy tale is apparently a nightmare behind the scenes this season.
	Juan Pablo Galavis, the current bachelor, is causing quite a stir for the hit romance reality series and producers aren't happy about it.
	""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over,"" a source connected to ""The Bachelor"" told E! News.
	Galavis, 32, started the series as the sexy Venezuelan single dad and soccer-playing hunk, but soon became a mouthpiece of insensitivity after making controversial comments about gay people and marriage.
	The ordeal left the network scrambling to distance itself from his views.
	""His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding, which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend,"" the insider told E! News, referring to the ""Bachelor"" couple from last season who recently tied the knot.
	Galavis also recently ruffled a few feathers after tweeting a joke using the “R word” that many find offensive towards those with mental disabilities.
	“In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone,” Galavis wrote, after deleting his alleged insult.
	Apparently, the final rose ceremony can't come soon enough.
	""It has not been anyone's favorite (season), that's for sure,"" the E! News source said.
	""He's the worst bachelor ever,” another insider added.

383	"Fans of ABC’s “The Bachelor” were notably disappointed by the main man of season 18 for multiple reasons, many of them being his ignorant views on life but apparently the loyal fan base of the series are not the only ones who have had enough of Juan Pablo. While it was known to the general public that Juan Pablo was no Sean Lowe, aka sweet, smart and oh so marketable, E! News just revealed that there would be no future partnership between ABC and Juan Pablo. The celebrity news outlet claims that the show’s producers, who were first thrilled with the idea of the first Latino bachelor, are know counting down the moments until season 18 comes to a close. Juan Pablo will of course have his fair share of late night talk show appearances, but a source told E! News that his time in the limelight will soon be up, ""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over.""The fans, the producers and even the winner of season 18 of “The Bachelor” have allegedly had enough of Juan Pablo. While we don’t yet know for sure, whom Juan Pablo will pick, but according to Reality Steve, the Latino bachelor will choose Nikki Ferrell over Clare Crawley but that doesn't mean he is picking her for life. Many news outlets are speculating that on tonight’s finale episode, JP does not propose to Nikki, but he does at least give her the final rose, so despite the lack of engagement, there is some sort of a commitment between the pair. Although E! News reports that the pair’s commitment has already run it’s course, apparently there has been “lots of fighting” happening between JP and Nikki.A source claims that JP and Nikki “are together at the finale, it's probably just an act,"" another source supports the claim that the couple’s relationship is already falling apart. The tension between the couple will come to a head on the live “After the Final Rose” episode, making it one of the most dramatic “Bachelor” finales ever. ""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,"" the source says. There are some reports claiming that ABC is attempting to salvage the season by paying JP to propose to Nikki on the “After the Final Rose” special, but considering their failing relationship ABC and Nikki Ferrell might just want to cut ties and run! Donovan Longo, staff reporter, joined the Latin Times team in February 2013 and has quickly become our resident pop culture expert.

384	"Juan Pablo Galavis' journey to find love on reality television is almost over.His tenure as ""The Bachelor"" comes to an end Monday with a two-hour finale episode, followed by a live ""After the Final Rose"" special.The Venezuelan single dad and former pro soccer player, 32, started the show with 27 women to choose from, and week by week narrowed them down to the final two -- Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse, and Clare, a 32-year-old hairdresser. His season got a lot of people talking -- and raised eyebrows on more than one occasion. There was his ""swim in the ocean"" in Vietnam with Clare and subsequent shaming of her about it, the voluntary departures of Sharleen and Andi and the latter's revelations about what kind of a guy Juan Pablo really is (according to her: self-absorbed, negative and prone to dismissing others' feelings with an ""It's OK""). And there was also his off-screen apology for anti-gay comments he made during in an interview back in January. There's been so much drama, in fact, that a source connected to the series told E! News, ""Everyone on the show cannot wait for this season to be over."" Another called Juan Pablo the ""worst Bachelor ever.""But, the question remains -- who will Juan Pablo pick? Will there be a proposal at the end of Monday's episode? Will it be accepted? And, will Juan Pablo and the winning woman still be in love when they appear on ""After the Final Rose""? We'll have to watch tonight, starting at 8 p.m. ET on ABC, to find out. Vote for who you think Juan Pablo will choose in the poll above, and weigh in on his ""Bachelor"" season in the comments.

With all of this in mind, then, it's no wonder that Juan Pablo Galvais has been voted the ""Worst Bachelor Ever."" According to E! News, the latest gaffe made by the least likable Bachelor in ABC history came as an end result of him re-tweeting a joke made by one of his ""fans"" on Twitter. The ""joke"" read: ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!"" He then added insult to injury by Tweeting that he ""loved"" the joke, while laughing along with it.

What does Bachelor star Juan Pablo Galavis really want? That's the question the final two women vying for his heart, as well as viewers across the country, are waiting to find out the answer to.The season finale of The Bachelor airs Monday night on ABC, with the reality TV star set to make his decision between Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley. But Monday night also marks the final edition of upstate New York store Rochester Appliance's four-week-long ad campaign featuring Galavis.VIDEO: 'Bachelor' Juan Pablo Galavis Selling Appliances in Upstate New YorkThe last commercial also addresses the question of what Galavis wants, but reveals his deepest desire is for something far more immediate, and less romantic, than Ferrell's or Crawley's hand in marriage.In addition to the final ad, Rochester Appliance has posted to its blog behind-the-scenes photos as well as all of the previous commercials that ran in recent weeks.

With two friends tagging along, Galavis, who some say is the worst bachelor in the show's history, drove to Las Vegas, posting pics of the road trip on Twitter and Instagram throughout the day.Ironically, or not, his first stop was to a wedding chapel, where he posed in front with a cheeky grin on his face. Galavis later got in the ring with his fellow country man, Linares, as the boxer was introduced. Before hitting the ring, JP posed for this shot with Linares.Gracias Por Venir Bro. @JuanPaGalavis Dios Te Bendiga y Que Viva Nuestra Venezuela pic.twitter.com/YQR7RHtRWD— JorgeLinares™ (@JorgeLinares) March 9, 2014After the fight he went to Joe's Stone Crab with friends for a meal. ""It was him and a bunch of guys who were a part of the Venezuelan fighter's team and a couple older ladies with big hair,"" a source said of the two-hour meal. Around 12:30 a.m., Galavis was seen at Beacher's Madhouse. According to witnesses, he didn't drink but he did pose for photos with the crowd. Juan Pablo Galavis will make his decision between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell on tonight's finale.

392	“The Bachelor” season 18 finale is set to air tonight (Monday) at 8 p.m., and spoilers about what will happen have been coming out.Juan Pablo is going to choose between Clare Crowley and Nikki, but some people already know what will happen because the entire season was filmed in 2013.Reality television blogger Reality Steve–whose prediction for the end of last season was wrong–is insisting that Pablo chooses Nikki. Other entertainment blogs are saying the same thing. But, he says, Pablo will not propose to her, making it the first season since Brad’s first season that there won’t be an engagement. Reality Steve says that Pablo never had any intention of finding a wife on the show–instead, he wanted to use it to get fame because he wants to act and model. Steve added that Pablo is being offered money to propose to Nikki on the “After the Final Rose” (ATFR) show–which airs live after the season finale.(ABC/Rick Rowell)(ABC)Apparently people involved with the ABC show are not fans of Pablo, with a source telling E! News that “Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over.”Producers and crew members have never been so ready for a season to end, the source said.“It has not been anyone’s favorite, that’s for sure.”Another source said that Pablo and the winner of the show have been fighting a lot.“Producers are hopeful that they’ll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,” one source said.“If they are together at the finale, it’s probably just an act.”Meanwhile, Andi Dorfman, who voluntarily left “The Bachelor,” is reportedly poised to become the next “Bachelorette.”That announcement will be made tonight during or after the ATFR show.  	Entertainment

												It will be a battle of the blondes on the season finale of “The Bachelor” Monday night, when 32-year-old Venezuelan single dad Juan Pablo Galavis will have to choose between hairstylist Clare Crawley and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell. Whom will he choose? Will the two women, sworn enemies, utter a single word to each other? It’s anyone’s guess, but it’s certainly been a crazy season. Here are our favorite moments from this season of El Bachelor:When Clare arrived at the opening-night ceremony wearing a prosthetic baby bump. Gentlemen, when a woman shows up for a first date pretending to be pregnant, you can’t say you haven’t been warned about any manner of crazy that ensues. Points awarded to Clare for truly bizarre humor, though.Contestant Lucy — whose occupation was listed as “Free Spirit” — and her inability to keep her clothes on. Whether she was happily strolling down the street nude to promote animal adoption or flashing everyone in the pool, Kate Upton BFF Lucy Aragon seemed far more interested in having fun than in pursuing any great love connection with blond, bland Juan Pablo. For this, Free Spirit Lucy, we salute you.Getting caught up in the spontaneity of a moment, Clare knocked on JP’s door and invited him for a midnight swim; he happily accepted, and there was a wild makeout session in the water. We didn’t hear any complaints until the following day, when JP announced that the hookup had been a mistake — he has a 4-year-old daughter, after all. Clare was ashamed; tears flowed, and “I have a 4-year-old daughter” was firmly established as JP’s favorite convenient excuse (followed closely by “English is my second language”).Hy Dorfman became the toast of Bachelor Nation during the show’s “Hometown Visits” episode, wherein Juan Pablo visited four contestants and their respective families. When asked if he would give his blessing to Juan Pablo and Andi, Hy turned the question on Juan Pablo, asking him how he would feel if his own daughter came to him with a man who was dating several other women. “If I seemed over-protective on the show, it is because I am protecting the most spectacular, special, amazing daughter in the world,” Hy tweeted after the show. The best part? If Andi Dorfman becomes the next Bachelorette, as has been widely speculated, we’ll get to see more of Hy.The host’s normally jovial demeanor has been cool this season; it’s clear from his flinty-eyed glances that he thinks Juan Pablo is a huge tool. In that estimation, he is far from alone; the hashtag “WorstBachelorEver” had plenty of entries on Twitter, and E! News published a recent story saying that Juan Pablo would not be cast on season 18 of “Dancing With the Stars” (he was reportedly seriously being considered at one point). It didn’t help when Juan Pablo said a gay “Bachelor” doesn’t belong on TV because gays are “more ‘pervert’ in a sense.” He blamed it on the language barrier. Nice try.Professional opera singer Sharleen Joynt was a breath of fresh air on the show, a gorgeous, smart woman who, while physically attracted to Juan Pablo, felt she was missing that “cerebral connection” she needed. “I wish I was a little dumber,” she said, frustrated with her tendency to “overthink” situations (not a problem shared by Juan Pablo). She mystified many of the other women, who seemed truly baffled that Juan Pablo was intrigued by the brunette. (Ladies, a hint: It could have had something to do with the fact that she wasn’t falling over herself to date him.) Sharleen eventually left of her own accord, a refreshing change from the usual tearful rose ceremony rejection with the guy calling all the shots.Fellow gorgeous smart woman Andi was another contestant to feel that Juan Pablo’s charms were only surface level; after a night in the Fantasy Suite that was anything but fantastic, she elected to leave as well. Juan Pablo’s response to this breakup? “Es okay,” he said, shrugging. And then, several more times throughout the farewell conversation: “Es okay.” We hope he’s looked into copyrighting this phrase; while “DWTS” doesn’t look like it’s going to pan out, there are always T-shirts and coffee mugs to be sold.

394	"TrendingDuring Juan Pablo‘s search for love, he encountered many (and we mean many) hilarious OMG moments. Somehow, we cut down the tons of crazy Bachelor moments down to six — and with the finale taking place March 10, we’re reminding you of the best, worst, and just all-around awkward moments on season 18. Click through our gallery to relive each and every one.While I’ll let you click through the gallery of the best moments, I have to run down some of most shocking moments of the season that I still can’t believe even happened. [hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]






The best moment of the entire season was when Andi Dorfman told JuanPabs exactly what he needed to hear — it’s not ok to only talk about yourself on every single date, it’s not okay to just kiss when you’re not talking about yourself, it’s not okay to bring up your overnight date with Clare on your overnight date with Andi, and it’s not ok to to tell someone they “barely” made it this far. Oh, and most importantly, it’s not ok to say “ees ok” after every statement. Then she tells him she’s over it. Even at the Women Tell All special, she said that she pretended to be asleep that night so the overnight date would be over. Ouch!However, Andi wasn’t the first to leave voluntarily. Sharleen was a favorite of JP’s all along, but since day one, she wasn’t sure she was totally into it. While their sexual chemistry was apparently really good (and the kissing was really bad to watch) , she pretty much told Juan Pablo she couldn’t see him as the Juan for her. She also told the cameras continually that pretty much, she was too smart for him. She actually said at one point, “I wish I was dumber.”They definitely had a connection, as did Juan Pablo and Andi — but both the girls (in my opinion) took the right route and got out of there!One more moment I’ve got to mention is that outfit that Nikki Ferrell rocked before she spent the night with Juan Pablo. They went horse back riding, so she wore pants, and they swam in the ocean, so she paired the pants with a bikini top — sounds ok? Well, we have to mention that the pants looked like a uniform from Woodstock, as they were wide-leg and floral print, and the bikini top had tassels all over it . . . Maybe she was going for ’70s cowgirl? The only thing more uncomfortable was that Juan Pablo told her if she wanted to just wear a thong, he’d be fine with that. Ugh!HollywoodLifers — click through the gallery of all the craziest moments on this season of the Bachelor, and then let us know which was the most shocking! Do you plan on watching the finale?— Emily LongerettaFollow @EmilyLongeretta"	Entertainment
395	Season 18 of “The Bachelor” is coming to a close on ABC on March 10, and needless to say the 2014 season has been a complete mess. Rumor has it that the producers and crew members have dubbed Juan Pablo “the worst bachelor ever,” and in honor of that, we’re looking back at his seven most controversial moments this season:1. Not Kissing Lauren … And Then Kissing ClareJuan Pablo started off the season by making and breaking some rules. In episode 4, Lauren tried to kiss the bachelor but was immediately shot down. Juan Pablo tried to console her, but Lauren ended up in tears.“I know that you’ve kissed other girls,” she told him. But all Juan Pablo would tell her is that it’s not an easy situation. He proceeded to tell the cameras that he’s not on the show to kiss everybody … but then went on to kiss Clare shortly after.“I know I said I’m not going to kiss anybody,” Juan Pablo explained to the cameras. “But she’s sexy. She’s hot.”2. Juan Pablo’s Anti-Gay Remarks While doing an interview to promote his season of “The Bachelor,” Juan Pablo made an extremely controversial comment about the possibility of a future gay bachelor. The 32-year-old reportedly told The TV Page’s Sean Daly: “I respect [gay people], but, honestly, I don’t think it’s a good example for kids.” “The Bachelor” star continued that he finds gay people to be “more ‘pervert’ in a sense,” and that the show would be “too hard to watch.”“Bachelor” host Chris Harrison later told the Hollywood Reporter that he was “disappointed” in Juan Pablo’s comments and that they don’t reflect his feelings or thoughts on the subject. Juan Pablo ended up being confronted by rejected bachelorette Kelly during the “Women Tell All” special, and told her that they would discuss it after the show.3. Clare’s Ocean DramaFrom the start of the season, Juan Pablo shared a steamy connection with Clare – and things escalated between the pair in episode 5. After a group date in Vietnam ended up with the two in his private pool, Clare decided to pay the single dad a visit in his hotel room … at 4 a.m. Asking him to jump in the ocean with her, Juan Pablo stripped off his shirt in a blink of an eye and ran after the 32-year-old California native. Clare told the cameras that the two “just went for it” and that it was “pure bliss … in every way.” But Juan Pablo didn’t feel the same way.The next day he pulled her aside and told her that he made a mistake. However Clare stood by her actions, telling the cameras that “there was no misunderstanding.”4. Sending Cassandra Home On Her BirthdayJuan Pablo made a promise to single moms Cassandra and Renee that he would let them know immediately if he didn’t feel a connection with them so that way they wouldn’t be separated any longer from their children. And he did just that with Cassandra … on her 22nd birthday.“I’ve been thinking a lot,” he told her. “It’s been so hard for me because you’re so gorgeous, you’re funny, you’re so nice … I wish we were in the same chapter.”It may not have been “controversial” that he dumped her on her birthday, but “Bachelor” fans did find it cruel.5. Sending Renee Home After Meeting Her Son In Hometown DatesAll season long Juan Pablo has called Renee and Cassandra his “special ones” because they are single moms. However after deciding to go on a Hometown date with Renee and meeting her son, he ended up dumping the 32-year-old. The move seemed hypocritical after he insisted throughout the season that he moved slow with her and was respectful of kissing her because he had her 8-year-old son, Ben, in mind. His decision to dump her after meeting Ben became even more controversial when he revealed a story about how Ben had been devastated over his mom’s last breakup.6. The Fantasy Suite ‘Nightmare’ With AndiAndi made it into the top 3, but when time came for her and Juan Pablo to spend some time away from the cameras in the fantasy suite things began to fall apart. While Andi stayed the night in the suite, in the morning she told the cameras that she couldn’t leave fast enough. According to the 26-year-old assistant district attorney, Juan Pablo spent the night “name dropping” and talking about his overnight date with Clare. She continued to tell the cameras that their evening was “unbelievable” and inappropriate” due to his inability to filter. “He thinks that he could say whatever he wants to say,” Andi explained, saying that it’s “just offensive.”7. The ‘Default’ DilemmaAndi chose to have a heart-to-heart with Juan Pablo about her decision to leave, and things proceeded to blow up. Juan Pablo told her everything was “OK” and that he respected her decision, but that wasn’t what Andi wanted to hear.“It’s not OK,” she fired back at him. “I put myself out there … it bothers me when you say it’s okay.”The bachelorette then brought up the fact that Juan Pablo allegedly told her that she made it into the top 3 by “default.” However Juan Pablo told her that he didn’t say “default” because it’s not in his vocabulary … instead he told her that he may have said “you barely made it here.”“She put words in my mouth by saying that I used the word ‘default,’” Juan Pablo later wrote in his blog for People. “It was because of her comments in Atlanta about wanting badly to fall in love that I almost decided to bring Renee instead of her, but I followed my heart and feelings instead.”The season finale of “The Bachelor” airs on March 10 on ABC at 8 p.m. EDT.

396	Today’s the day, rose lovers! By the time we fall asleep tonight, we’ll know the outcome of Juan Pablo’s aventura to find love. Will he choose Clare? Will he choose Nikki? Will he propose? Will he walk away alone? Luckily, we’re only a few hours away from finding out the answers.To tide you over until the finale, we’ve got one last installment of our countdown to the Bachelor finale. Specifically, it’s an exclusive deleted scene from the season’s last episode, in which Juan Pablo meets with jeweler Neil Lane to look at rings and discuss his final two women. And by discuss, we mean he says, “They smile a lot.” And when Neil Lane asks Juan Pablo who he “shine[s] the most with,” Juan Pablo doesn’t seem to have an answer. All of this leads to one burning question: Will he propose to anyone?Watch the Bachelor fumble over his words (and look a little panicked) in the clip below:The Bachelor finale airs tonight at 8 p.m. on ABC.

402	 TV News Clare Crawley, Nikki Ferrell, The Bachelor 0 Comment March 10, 2014Tonight, it’s finally here: The light at the end of the tunnel for “The Bachelor.” What this season has shown to us is that this show’s fanbase is one of the most patient ones out there. Even though this season is by most estimations terrible, and Juan Pablo Galavis is not exactly the most sought-after man in America (let alone his in Miami), people still watch.As of right now, the biggest question for many is whether or not we are going to actually see him still with the person he picks, and we’ll find that out during the live “After the Final Rose” special tonight. If there is a woman still by his side, maybe she can give a much better explanation about why he comes off some badly than Juan Pablo has been able to give himself.At this point in time, there’s not really even that much of a debate to us: Nikki Ferrell is almost surely winning the thing. Her relationship with Juan Pablo is so much more natural than anything that Clare Crawley has with him; there just seems to be a whole lot more there when it comes to drama, and we have already seen from him that this is not a guy who is particularly down for that. With his attention on his daughter, he probably just wants to say “it’s okay” to end every argument under the sun.As for if Nikki (if this prediction is correct) is still with him, there are only three possible explanations as to why she would:1. She genuinely loves him, regardless of what any of the tabloids say about him and some of the things that he has said.2. She recognizes that there is more value in being with him when it comes to her career, or appearances that they could make together. (Then again, we don’t feel like that is necessarily true in this case.)3. She wants to put on a good face tonight, and then potentially end the relationship a little ways down the road.Of course, we want to hear all of your responses to these in the comment box below!

Anna Sanclement is a freelance blogger/writer, who enjoys writing about celebrity gossip and parenting. You can read more of her work on her blog Mama Writes.Far short of controversial comments, Juan Pablo Galavis hit Las Vegas, Nevada, to watch a boxing match just two nights before the The Bachelor finale airs. The opinionated single father apparently also visited a wedding chapel as a possible hint to how the hit dating show might end.Galavis decided to document his whole trip on Twitter. Mainly there to watch fellow countryman Jorge Linares of Venezuela take on Nihito Arakawa in a boxing match, Galavis also jokingly took a photo of the MGM wedding chapel.In the photo, Galavis stands in front of the chapel smiling and pointing to the entrance, seemingly teasing fans with what might be a hint to how the show ends in the final episode.Galavis traveled with two pals who accompanied him to the fight and later to a dinner with 10 members of Linares' boxing team. The group ate at Joe's Stone Crab, staying at the eatery for more than two hours.""It was him and a bunch of guys who were a part of the Venezuelan fighter's team and a couple of older ladies with big hair,"" a source for People magazine said.CONGRATS to my BRO @JorgeLinares for that WIN tonight... pic.twitter.com/LovIklVxXlAfter the meal, Galavis and his two friends went to Beacher's Madhouse nightclub for a short visit. The 32-year-old The Bachelor star didn't drink anything, but he posed for photos with fans for about 30 minutes. Then the three friends took a stroll around the MGM Grand's casino where Galavis posed for more photos with anyone who would request it.After several recent controversial comments, Galavis has become a polarizing figure among The Bachelor fans. Some call him the worst Bachelor ever while others think he's just honest and possibly misunderstood because of his Spanish language barrier.After an eventful season, Galavis will choose between his two finalists, Clare and Nikki, on Monday night, and will most likely propose to one of them, given that it all goes well. However, as with many seasons before this one, several rumors have claimed that the current Bachelor does not propose to anyone at the end of the show.SheKnows Media &dash; EntertainmentThe stuff you need to know, crafted just for you.

407	 The much-anticipated Season 18 finale of The Bachelor has been touted as the Most Dramatic Finale Ever, which brings up the question: Exactly how juicy would it have to be in order to top all the previous 17 finales? While Juan Pablo, Nikki, and Clare (and Andi) have created plenty of gossip to keep America occupied and guessing at how their quest for love will end, let’s not forget the many men and women who have walked down this road before.And if their experiences are any indication, there will most likely be a proposal… but a wedding? Improbable.When the first season of The Bachelor aired in 2002, the dating game show ended with bachelor Alex Michel making a difficult decision in choosing between the final two contestants. While episode previews showed him picking out Harry Winston rings, he didn’t actually propose.Since then, however, there’s been a steady trend of proposals in recent years, with more than half of the seasons ending in proposals thus far.Unfortunately, an accepted proposal doesn’t automatically lead to marriage. In fact, only one of the final rose ceremony proposals resulted in a wedding, and that didn’t happen until season 17 with Sean and Catherine. (Jason and Molly from season 13 got married as well, but he actually proposed to someone else on the show.)Watch the video above to see how it ended for some of the most notable couples from previous seasons of The Bachelor. Juan Pablo fans (if any such people exist) will probably hope that his story ends a little differently from the norm.	Entertainment
408	No one likes Juan Pablo Galavis this season, as the Bachelor is getting ripped by all of the women and even guys from other seasons are saying that he is using the women on the show for fame.Chris Bukowski, from Emily Maynard’s Bachelorette season has given his opinion on the Venezuelan charmer and he doesn’t have a very high one of him.PHOTOS: Behind-The-Scenes Exclusive! ‘The Bachelor’ Secrets & Scandals Exposed“I’m not convinced any of those girls are going to be his future wife,” Chris told Cupid’s Pulse about Juan Pablo.The ABC reality show star has come under fire from the women he tried to romance, with Andi telling him off and everyone else ganging up on him during the Women Tell All special, and his actions are what worry Chris too.“I think he’s using the show as a way to enjoy himself and probably get himself out in the public eye,” he said.EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS: Bachelor Reunion PicsAs for his own love life, Chris says he isn’t tied down to anyone right now.“I am the most single person in America,” but that he’s ready for love with the right girl.“I love the fairytale endings.”	Entertainment
409	The most controversial season of “The Bachelor” is finally coming to a close on tonight’s highly anticipated finale, but before we get rolling on our countdown and predictions there is a new piece of Juan Pablo evidence that we must consider. The evidence is a recently released deleted scene from season 18 of ABC’s hugely popular dating series, and the two subjects in the scene are none other than Juan Pablo and Clare, and like the rest of this couple’s alone time the moment captured on film is tender and romantic.The competition has come down to just two women, Clare and Nikki, and tonight’s finale episode will have Juan Pablo choosing one of them to marry while the other one just sent home with just her bags in tow. But way back before the competition was narrowed down so severely Juan Pablo and Clare made waves in the literal waves by becoming the first “Bachelor” couple to how should we say this, take a “dip in the ocean” so early on in the competition. They were immediately attracted to each other from the gecko with the pair enjoying the first intimate one-on-one date for the season. During the date, Juan Pablo and Clare enjoyed a private concert from Josh Krajcik. Like many other couples after enjoying his music and show, they have come to consider Krajcik’s “No Better Lovers” their song. Before listening to it in the tender moment that was deleted from the season, they have danced to it before during another one-on-one date.Juan Pablo plays the sweet song off his cell phone while the pair are just lounging on the couch, the thoughtful gesture takes Clare by such surprise that she even begins to cry. The pair does begin their signature make out, with a bit of candid lip-syncing in between, before Clare announcing, “We should just play it when we get married.” While Juan Pablo does not immediately respond to her request for the wedding song, he does belt out a cute “baby” right in tune with the song, so we are assuming he agrees.Obviously we are basing our assumption of who Juan Pablo picks off of spoilers, and while the king of TV spoilers Reality Steve claims that JP ends up picking Nikki Ferrell in the final rose ceremony, this exclusive video is making us second guess. JP and Clare had an immediate connection, and the pair are obviously attracted to each other physically, what we thought was lacking was their emotional connection. However, after watching them relaxing together and then JP produce a romantic surprise for Clare, we are thinking that these two are more in love than we first assumed. Clare obviously feels comfortable enough to openly discuss marriage with him, so much so that she is already planning the playlist.Donovan Longo, staff reporter, joined the Latin Times team in February 2013 and has quickly become our resident pop culture expert.

You could see that last week on The Bachelor 2014 Women Tell All special and the women ganging up to attack Juan Pablo and not attack each other! They said it (and I agree with them), but they don’t think Juan Pablo was genuine in his search for a wife and stepmother to his daughter Camila.So, whoever does win The Bachelor 2014 tonight, do we think they will still be together a month from now, if they are ever still together today? I don’t think so, but I am picking Nikki Ferrel to win The Bachelor Season 18 tonight and then moving on to date Jef Holm this summer!Who do you think wins The Bachelor 2014 tonight?Join us on Gossip & Gab for all your The Bachelor 2014 spoilers.

415	Viewers can watch The Bachelor finale live online and see whether Juan Pablo Galavis picks Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell — or maybe neither.This season of the popular ABC reality dating show has been particularly noteworthy, and Galavis has garnered headlines for his controversial statements off the show and questionable behavior on it. Last week contestant Andi took herself out of the running after a fantasy suite date with Juan Pablo turned ugly.Andi accused the Bachelor of caring only about himself, and not putting in the time to learn even the most basic details about her.The season will come to an end Monday at 8 pm ET, when Juan Pablo will pick between the remaining two women, Clare and Nikki.Viewers who watch The Bachelor finale live online will get to see if there are any fireworks to end the memorable season. The show’s host, Chris Harrison, has said Juan Pablo has generated more interest than any other Bachelor he can remember, and not for all good reasons. Some outlets have painted him as the “most disliked Bachelor of all time.”Harrison said he doesn’t know if that’s true, but does admit that Juan Pablo is a big draw with viewers.“I don’t know how you answer that,” Harrison says. “Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven’t that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor…. People want to follow Juan Pablo because he’s unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions.”Viewers can watch The Bachelor finale live online thanks to ABC’s Watch Live function. The live streaming video may not be available in all areas, but for those who miss out on Monday the show will be put online within a day of airing.[Images Via ABC]All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.

416	"The Bachelor Season 18 finale airs Monday night on ABC. But before you watch Juan Pablo Galavis face Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley in the “After The Final Rose” special, check out our preview and spoilers below.Last week on The Bachelor Season 18, the ladies got to confront Juan Pablo over his sleazy behavior. The most common complaint was that Juan Pablo focused too much on himself during the one-on-one dates, instead of taking the time to learn about the bachelorettes. Andi Dorfman in particular put forth this view after her disastrous Fantasy Suite date earlier in the season.RELATED: Why Nikki Should Have Said No To The Final Rose “The things he said were entirely inappropriate and rude, but he wasn't mean to me,” Andi said about the experience that made her quit Bachelor Season Season 18. “ I think that should be made very clear. I think sometimes it's just that he doesn't think about it ... There's no filter there.”And, of course, there was a discussion of Juan Pablo’s controversial comments on gays. The Bachelor Season 18 star said in January that homosexuals on the ABC series would set a “bad example” for kids. He also claimed gays were “more pervert,” though he later blamed his comments on the language barrier. Kelly Travis in particular  was offended by these remarks because of her gay father.RELATED: Juan Pablo Criticized For R-Word TweetsWatch the women confront Juan Pablo on the Bachelor Season 18 ""Women Tell All"" special.“I understood why Kelly wanted an explanation about my gay comments because during my adventure we had talked openly about her father,” Juan Pablo wrote before the Bachelor Season 18 finale.RELATED: Was Juan Pablo On The Show For The Wrong Reasons?“I told Kelly that I would love to have an hourlong chat with her so that she can better understand what was misinterpreted and what my views are. I also want to understand her views and her experiences, just like when I listened to her tell me about her father. More than anything, I want to make sure Kelly knows how sorry I am that her feelings were hurt. I hate hurting people.”But according to reports, that hour-long chat never happened. Perhaps we will find out why during Monday’s “After The Final Rose” special. RELATED: Shocking Developments During Bachelor Hometown DatesSo who will win the final rose in the Bachelor Season 18 finale? Watch a promo for the Bachelor Season 18 finale.WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOWAccording to Reality Steve, Nikki Ferrell will win Season 18 of The Bachelor. Juan Pablo will not propose to Nikki, but the two will instead decide to date. And it appears the plan worked, as the couple will still be together for the live “After The Final Rose” special.But could we see an engagement on the Bachelor Season 18 finale after all? Reality Steve also claims that Juan Pablo might have a monetary offer from ABC to propose on “After The Final Rose.” The special is also expected to reveal that the aforementioned Andi is the next Bachelorette.You can watch The Bachelor Season 18 finale live at 8 p.m. EST. But if you cannot get to a television, you can watch a live stream of Episode 11, including “After The Final Rose,” at ABC.com.

424	"[WARNING: POTENTIAL SEASON FINALE SPOILERS AHEAD!]Are you ready for the Season 18 finale of “The Bachelor”? Viewers of the ABC dating series might be … but it doesn’t sound like Juan Pablo and his lucky lady are.After weeks of group and one-on-one dates, Juan Pablo has finally narrowed down his search to two women – Nikki and Clare. But with the 2014 “Bachelor” season finale set to air on March 10, reports are surfacing that Juan Pablo and the winner are not going to have their “happily ever after.”According to E! News, Juan Pablo and the Season 18 winner have been fighting … a lot. “Producers are hopeful that they’ll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,” a source revealed to the site. “If they are together at the finale, it’s probably just an act.”[WARNING: Do NOT continue reading unless you want to find out who reportedly won Season 18 of “The Bachelor.”]But who is the woman that Juan Pablo is struggling with? Who Juan Pablo chooses will not be unveiled until the end of the season finale, but Reality Steve (the all-knowing reality-TV blogger) revealed on his site that the Season 18 winner is none other than … Nikki! However Juan Pablo doesn’t reportedly propose to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse. Instead, Reality Steve claims that the 32-year-old single dad will simply “choose” to be with her.As we previously reported, Season 18 of “The Bachelor” is set to come to a “shocking conclusion” as Juan Pablo prepares to make “one of the most difficult choices of his life.” However viewers will see that Juan Pablo isn’t the only one with a decision to make. Andi’s early departure could potentially throw both Clare and Nikki into a tailspin as they contemplate what went wrong, and if the same thing could happen to them.But the real drama will come in the “After The Final Rose” special, which is set to air after the finale at 10 p.m. EDT. The special episode will feature a live sit down with Juan Pablo and host Chris Harrison as they discuss the final two women – Clare and Nikki. The bachelor will explain what was going on in his mind during his final few days in St. Lucia, all leading up to the “shocking outcome” of the 2014 “Bachelor” season. It’s during the “After The Final Rose” episode that Juan Pablo will finally be reunited with Clare or Nikki … and fans will be able to see whether tension between the two exists.Catch the Season 18 finale of “The Bachelor” on March 10 at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC. And don’t miss the “After The Final Rose” special when it airs directly after at 10 p.m. EDT.Will you be tuning in? Who do you think will win? Let us know in the comments section or send a tweet to @AmandaTVScoop.    Will Nikki win Juan Pablo's heart on ""The Bachelor""? Photo: ABC  Subscribe"	Entertainment

	Nikki or Clare? Clare or Nikki?
	We're hours away from finding out.
	The conclusion of what has become a gripping Bachelor season airs tonight on ABC, Juan Pablo Galavis as chooses between two women who both hope to find their perfect fairy tale ending.
	Will Nikki get the final rose? Will Clare cry tears of joy? Or will Juan Pablo pull a Brad Womack and choose neither, a possibility that seems more and more likely as his family says below that the star is ""pretty much"" ready to settle down.
	Not exactly a ringing endorsement, is it?
	You still have time to watch The Bachelor online if you need to catch up and then you can watch the following promo:

Who do you hope Juan Pablo chooses?

But we're still hashing over last week's puzzling episode, which seemed to indicate that the ""mother"" may not be long for the world. That has to be a red herring, right? Right?! ""Believe"" (10 p.m., NBC): Can one gifted child save the world? That's the question pegged to this new drama series from J.J. Abrams and Oscar-winning ""Gravity"" director Alfonso Cuaron about a 10-year-old girl (Johnny Sequoyah) who possess incredible -- but unharnessed -- supernatural powers.Also on Monday: ""Bones"" (8 p.m., Fox) ""The Voice"" (8 p.m., NBC) ""How I Met Your Mother"" (8 p.m., CBS) ""Switched at Birth"" (8 p.m, ABC Family) ""Dallas"" (9 p.m., TNT) ""Single Ladies"" (9 p.m., VH1) ""Mike & Molly"" (9 p.m., CBS) ""Beauty and the Beast,"" Season finale (9 p.m., The CW) ""Archer"" (10 p.m., FX) ""Lost Girl"" (10 p.m., Syfy) ""Southern Charm"" (10 p.m., Bravo) ""The Bachelor: After the Final Rose"" (10 p.m., ABC)Contact Chuck Barney at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.ChuckBarney, or Twitter.com/chuckbarney

	The Bachelor Season 18 comes to a gripping conclusion tonight, when Juan Pablo Galavis gets down on one knee and pops the question to his soulmate.
	Or not. But someone will win the final rose, FWIW.
	Barring a stunning development in which Juan pulls a Brad Womack and picks no one this evening either Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley will win Season 18.
	We could actually see that happening, for sure, but The Bachelor spoilers indicate he does in fact choose someone. But who? And how? And does it last?
	For those details, just read on, The Bachelor fans ...
	So will Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley become Juan Pablo's wife? We're going to go ahead and say no and no, based on what we know of this guy.
	That said, Galavis does choose one woman over the other:
Nikki Ferrell will walk away as your winner this evening.
	The most controversial and least popular Bachelor ever has been accused of not taking this so seriously, and according to Reality Steve, doesn't propose.
	According to inside sources, Galavis is still ""hurt"" after getting dumped by Andi Dorfman and ""doesn't necessarily find his soul mate with Clare and Nikki.""
	It is speculated that Juan Pablo and the winner ""left as a couple"" after the St. Lucia season finale, but there are no engagement or marriage plans. At all.
	So are they still together, since that was October?

	Rumors have suggested that when the After The Final Rose special airs tonight, we'll learn that they aren't even together after the ""journey"" we just watched.
	Not necessarily, the latest reports indicate.
	They are still together as of the ATFR taping, and not only that, the producers are trying to convince Juan Pablo Galavis to propose on the broadcast!
	Think he will? We have serious doubts.
	The Bachelor spoilers and predictions have been accurate this season, so we're still anticipating a very short lived relationship between Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell.
	Still, we've been wrong before, more than once, and until you watch The Bachelor online (or live), you'll ever know with 100 percent certainty what happens.
UPDATE: It's over! Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo Galavis are a couple!
	That's right, a couple. She got the rose, but he didn't propose.
	Clare Crawley got the boot, and Nikki won. But that's it.
	A quick rundown on the season finale:
	As for whether Juan and Nikki have any sort of future, we'll have to wait until the After the Final Rose special, and likely a long time beyond that, to find out ...
Juan Pablo and Nikki: Will it last?







Yes. Forever and ever. They are made for each other.Maybe for awhile. Don't count them out. LOLOLOLOLOL

Worst Bachelor ever?







Yes. What a jackass.Not the biggest fan, but give him a break!Shut up haters! I love him! Juan Pablo forever!!!!!!

 Thereâ€™s still a lot of growing to do in our relationship. We will not tie the knot until I am mentally and physically prepared as well as Matt. It was a fairytale proposal like Iâ€™ve always dreamed about. I forgot that there [were] cameras around. In that moment, it was just Matt and I and it was the most amazing moment of my entire life.Submissions? Questions? Looking to advertise?

430	"I think Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis may be past the point of a simple ""Bless his heart."" He just needs to step quietly away from the roses and fade back into obscurity. And while he's at it, he should probably stop blaming all of his insensitive remarks on a language barrier.On Friday, Juan Pablo retweeted (and then quickly deleted due to backlash) a follower's joke that made light of disabilities. In the aftermath, he told his detractors to ""relax"" and ""try to be happy and enjoy jokes and sarcasm."" I'm confused. Hasn't ol' JP blamed all of his cluelessness about sarcasm on his language barrier? It seems that ABC is as tired of this season's Bachelor as I am!CLICK THE CONTINUE READING BUTTON FOR MORE! A source close to the show dished to E! News, telling the site that Juan Pablo is just as dramatic and hard deal with behind the scenes. The insider reveals, ""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over.""Continuing, the source explains,""His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend,"" adding that everyone who is working on the show is more than ready for the season to draw to a close. The insider claims, ""It has not been anyone's favorite, that's for sure,"" with another source sharing that employees of the show believe that Juan Pablo is ""the worst bachelor ever.""As for finding a wife on the series, many sources cite rumors of ""lots of fighting"" between JP and whoever was lucky (yeah, no) enough to make it to the end. One insider admits, ""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath. If they are together at the finale, it's probably just an act.""Poor girl!TELL US-WHAT DO YOU THINK OF JUAN PABLO? IS HE THE WORST BACHELOR EVER? [Photo Credit: Starbucks/WENN.com]"	Entertainment

“How I Met Your Mother” (8 p.m., CBS): Lily apparently pulls a disappearing act this week. But we’re still hashing over last week’s puzzling episode, which seemed to indicate that the “mother” may not be long for the world. That has to be a red herring, right? Right?!



“Believe” (10 p.m., NBC): Can one gifted child save the world? That’s the question pegged to this new drama series from J.J. Abrams and Oscar-winning “Gravity” director Alfonso Cuaron about a 10-year-old girl (Johnny Sequoyah) who possess incredible — but unharnessed — supernatural powers.

432	"The season finale of ""The Bachelor"" is just a few hours away and fans of the show are eagerly waiting to see who Juan Pablo Galavis might choose as his partner - Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley.Rumor has it that Ferrell will be the last one standing, as Galavis seemingly made his choice clear when he introduced the pediatric nurse to his daughter and former partner in one of the earlier episodes. The fact that only Ferrell's family seemed to embrace Galavis is a point in her favor.But Crawley, too, appears to have a strong hold on Galavis, as the duo was seen discussing their wedding song in one of the deleted episodes.In the clip, Galavis is seen taking out his cell phone, making Crawley feel that he is going to take a selfie. But the bachelor plays Josh Krajcik's ""No Better Lovers,"" which immediately bring tears to Crawley's eyes.""I love this song,"" Crawley says before kissing Galavis, who in turn comforts crying Crawley saying: ""We started like that. Don't cry.""Crawley then tells him that they should play the song when they get married. The former Venezuelan soccer did not respond to the suggestion, instead just kissed her.Later, during a confessional interview, Crawley said that she became emotional as she was caught up in the moment.""I am lost in the moment. That song is how I feel and how I felt.""""Juan Pablo has definitely helped to break down those walls that have been up around my heart,"" she added.Meanwhile, Reality Steve, a blogger who said Ferrell would be crowned the winner much before the current season premiered on ABC, is sticking to his prediction. But he notes that there might not be an engagement when the show ends.""Juan Pablo and Nikki left Saint Lucia as a couple, but not engaged. First time in 10 seasons, there hasn't been a proposal at the end,"" Steve writes in his blog. He also added that there is a monetary offer for Galavis to propose to Ferrell on the ""After the Final Rose"" show.It remains to be seen if Steve's prediction will prove to be accurate.The season finale of ""The Bachelor"" will be telecast on Monday at 8 pm on ABC.(Edited by Anu James)"	Entertainment

It features Pablo and would-be girlfriend Claire, getting cozy on a sofa (get your mind out of the gutter) and sharing a tender moment, set to Josh Krajcik’s No Better Lovers.During the tender moment, JP pulls out his phone, making Claire think he is about to take a selfie, romantic guy that he is. But he pulls a surprise move on her, playing No Better Lovers, at which point his ladylove practically melts into a puddle of happiness.

438	The Bachelor finale is set to air with Juan Pablo Galavis picking between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell, but spoilers indicate a twist ending to what has been an all-around controversial season.Though Juan Pablo started out as a fan-favorite pick to serve as the latest Bachelor, some of his actions this season have worn thin with viewers. First there were remarks he made in January that having a gay Bachelor would be “too perverted,” a comment that prompted ABC to respond that “Juan Pablo’s comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show’s producers or studio.”Then there have been instances on the show the paint him as a womanizer, including a fantasy suite date with Andi where Juan Pablo seemed not too interested in learning about her. That ended with Andi calling out Juan Pablo for his behavior before taking herself off the show.The Bachelor finale spoilers indicate an even bigger twist to end the show.[WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD]For one, the blogger Reality Steve seems to think that Juan Pablo is more interested in himself than either of the two remaining women. While Steve does say that Juan Pablo ends up picking Nikki, but not actually proposing to her.Steve, who has successfully predicted the ending of all but one season so far, wrote:“Make no mistake about this season, and you can choose to believe me or not – this was a complete cash grab for Juan Pablo. He never had any interest in finding a wife on this show, or a step mother for Camila, or whatever else line of BS ABC will run at you all season. This guy wants to act, he wants to be in commercials, he wants to model, and he wants to be on Dancing with the Stars. Come the spring season, you can pretty much bet your a** that Juan Pablo will be on DWTS, even though he can’t dance a lick.”Reports from after The Bachelor finale seem to bolster the idea. In February, Juan Pablo was seen at a Miami Heat game with singer Mayra Veronica, with witnesses saying the two were acting very much like a couple.Another source told Life & Style magazine that Juan Pablo has been seen cozying up with at least three different women since the show wrapped, and none of them were the final two women on the show. The source also said that Juan Pablo doesn’t seem to have much direction in his life.“The cash is running out – fast,” the show insider told Life & Style magazine. “Nobody seems to know how Juan Pablo makes a living. During the week he spends his time going to the gym or the beach. His life in Miami seems rather mundane.”Fans who want to see if The Bachelor finale spoilers come true can tune in to the episode, which airs Monday at 8 pm ET on ABC.All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.

439	Here’s what’s up in the world of television for Monday, March 10. All times are Eastern.TOP PICKThe Bachelor (ABC, 8 p.m.): Our long national nightmare is over, at least for the next month or so—Juan Pablo and the 18th season of The Bachelor release their hold on us tonight. Unfortunately, that is because Juan Pablo will then sink his teeth into either Nikki or Clare, two unsuspecting women who came on a television show looking for a soulmate. Their national nightmare is just beginning. Claire had an early lead with all that ocean sex, and that deleted scene with the suggested wedding song might be a sure sign Clare is going to win. [Or a feint to distract us from Nikki’s success! ONLY TIME (and ratings) WILL TELL.] We’re not covering this, because Juan Pablo is a name we’d rather forget as soon as possible. We’d rather Clare and Sharleen hooked up and ditched Juan Pablo for the nearest tropical resort. But that’s why they don’t let us write about The Bachelor anymore—too much slashfic.ALSO NOTEDRegular Show (Cartoon Network, 7:30 p.m.): We’re tickled because Regular Show is doing an honest-to-goodness Daylight Saving Time-themed episode—Mordecai and Rigby have to change all the clocks in the park. Alasdair Wilkins will only begin to observe Daylight Saving Time when the park does, too.Believe (NBC, 10 p.m.): And tonight is the series premiere of the much-promoed new NBC drama, Believe—which has Alfonso Cuáron at the helm! Good, right? Not really! Brandon Nowalk reviewed the pilot for us pre-air, and he thinks it’s not good yet, but could be, ONLY IF YOU BELIEEEEVE! Read his review (AND BELIEVEEEEE) here.AdvertisementRick And Morty (Adult Swim, 10:30 p.m.): Back after a long hiatus is Dan Harmon’s animated spectacular, featuring a hapless kid and his alcoholic grandpa. Now that Zack Handlen has caught up on the first few reviews we missed, it’s time to embrace Snuffles and his missing testicles with equal fervor. AVE ATQUE VALE. HAIL, AND FAREWELL.REGULAR COVERAGEAdventure Time (Cartoon Network, 7 p.m.)Switched At Birth (ABC Family, 8 p.m.)RuPaul’s Drag Race (LOGO, 8 p.m.)How I Met Your Mother (CBS, 8 p.m.)The Following (Fox, 9 p.m.)Bates Motel (A&E, 9 p.m.)Mom (CBS, 9:30 p.m.)Archer (FX, 10 p.m.)Teen Wolf (MTV, 10 p.m.)AdvertisementELSEWHERE IN TV CLUBTodd VanDerWerff delved into the ’60s sitcom He & She for One-Season Wonders, Weirdos, And Wannabes. It was a show ahead of its time; looking back, it’s easy to see both why it failed and also how enormously influential it would prove to be. He & She laid the foundation for The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but the network didn’t always know what to do with the show. As Todd observes:It wasn’t as if CBS had a huge number of open timeslots conducive to a witty, urban drama about two young married people who were very obviously having copious amounts of sex (and having a great time with it to boot).AdvertisementWHAT ELSE IS ON?Bones (Fox, 8 p.m.): This show, which was just renewed for a 10th (?!) season, is debuting in its new timeslot tonight, after languishing in Fridays for a bit. Is there some kind of planned synergy—or, God forbid, a crossover being plotted between this and The Following? BEELEIEEEEVEEEEEEE!Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills (Bravo, 9 p.m.): We are pretty sure we have written about the finale of this show already, and also sure that we will feature it again in the future. But some type of finale for RHOBH is happening tonight—and then there will be a three-part, three-hour reunion that will rehash all the drama of the finale. And then we’ll need another reunion special for all the drama after that. And then we’ll all die. Time is a flat circle. BELIEEEEEEEEEVEEEAdvertisementTop Gear (BBC America, 8:30 p.m.): Richard tests out a Porsche hybrid sports car in Abu Dhabi, and Aaron Paul sits in, and thinks about, the Reasonably Priced Car. They are not the same car. Probably. (BEELIEIEIEIVEIVIEIEIVEIEE)Bates Motel: After Hours (A&E, 11 p.m.): After everyone goes to sleep, Norman Bates plays video games. Norma watches My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. No one is hurt… tonight.Jaws (AMC, 8 p.m.): Live every week like it’s Shark Week by watching this movie tonight. Also don’t wear jewelry in the ocean, or douse yourself in fishblood, because we imagine that also draws sharks. Also don’t play that music. When that music starts you just know something bad is going to happen.AdvertisementLegally Blonde (Oxygen, 8 p.m.): Exercise makes endorphins. And endorphins make you happy! And happy people just don’t kill their husbands.WWE Raw (USA, 8 p.m.): John Cena returns, as does The Authority. And Undertaker returns to hunt down Brock Lesnar. BELIEVE!IN CASE YOU MISSED ITCosmos: John Teti took a look at this new, Neil DeGrasse Tyson-helmed look into the unknown vastness of the spacetime abyss. The abyss, as it turned out, stared back.Advertisement	Entertainment
440	  FINALE WATCH: It takes three grueling hours to wrap up this season of “The Bachelor” (ABC at 8 p.m.). Before the final rose is handed out, the two remaining bachelorettes are introduced to Juan Pablo’s family and they each go on a final solo date. Also on the show for some reason: bachelors and bachelorettes from seasons past.For the first night in its new time slot, “Bones” (Fox at 8) has Booth and CIA agent Danny Beck in hot pursuit of an Afghan terrorist after a CIA informant is murdered.When Lily disappears in the middle of an argument on “How I Met Your Mother” (CBS at 8), Marshall enlists the help of Ted and Barney to find where she went.Blind auditions continue on this two-hour episode of “The Voice” (NBC at 8). The special “Heirs to the Dare” (Discovery at 9) follows the lives of three present-day daredevils as they attempt stunts in the spirit of yesterday’s legendary daredevils, such as Evel Knievel.Joe, Emma and Mandy are still trying to adapt to their new life at the compound on “The Following” (Fox at 9), while Ryan is trying to track down Joe’s mentor. SERIES PREMIERE: J.J. Abrams’s latest, “Believe” (NBC at 10), is about a 10-year-old girl (played by Johnny Sequoyah) with supernatural powers and the prison inmate chosen to protect her. In Friday’s Post, TV critic Hank Stuever called it “a medium-concept, briskly stylish, slightly sci-fi drama.” It moves to its regular time slot at 9 on Sunday, March 16.If you aren’t ready to completely let go of Juan Pablo just yet, you’re in luck! Following the finale, ABC is giving you “The Bachelor: After the Final Rose” (10), a live discussion of what just went down and also where we learn who the next star of “The Bachelorette” will be. RETURNING SHOW: Back for a second round, “The People’s Couch” (Bravo at 11:30) takes cameras into everyday American homes and tapes families as they watch drama-filled Bravo television.Actress Kristen Bell and comedian Steve Harvey are on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” (NBC at 11:35), with music from Demi Lovato.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) stops by the “Late Show With David Letterman” (CBS at 11:35), with a performance from Little Mix. “Jimmy Kimmel Live” (ABC at 11:35) heads to SXSW and talks to actor Seth Rogen and rapper Snoop Dogg with a musical performance from White Denim. — Rachel Lubitz 	Entertainment

444	"It can be said that Juan Pablo Galavis has been the most controversial bachelor. But he has also been named the “worst bachelor ever.” He has been causing drama behind the scenes of the show. A source even said ""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over. ""His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend."" The source added that crew members and producers are ready for the season to end and they have never been so ready.Multiple sources have said that there has been a lot of fighting between Juan Pablo and the winner of the show. The source added ""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath. If they are together at the finale, it's probably just an act.""This has been one of the most talked about seasons in the history of the show despite the negativity and distaste towards Juan Pablo. Is he really the worst bachelor ever? Stay tuned to ABC on Monday March 10 at 8 p.m. to see who Juan Pablo will choose.Paloma Torres has worked at CNN en Español as an affiliates producer, covering stories from all over Latin America.

445	It’s officially time for day three of our countdown to the Bachelor finale! The subject of choice: A deleted scene featuring a tender moment between Juan Pablo and one of his final two women, Clare.Before all the drama surrounding Juan Pablo and Clare’s dip in the ocean, they were just the happy couple who went on the first one-on-one date of the season. And during that date, they were treated to a private concert from Josh Krajcik. From that point on, they’ve considered Krajcik’s “No Better Lovers” their song. They even danced to it during a one-on-one date later in the season.And in an exclusive deleted scene, we see Juan Pablo surprise Clare by playing it on his phone, a move that makes her tear up and proclaim, “We should just play it when we get married.”Watch the video below:The Bachelor finale airs Monday, March 10, at 8 p.m.	Entertainment

According to the latest gossip, however, he doesn't have much else to give.In the latest cover of Life & Style, the tabloid claims to have acquired information that makes Galavis' ""Secret Life EXPOSED."" The magazine reportedly spoke with ""a show insider,"" who shared surprising information about the former professional soccer player, according to Radar Online.""The cash is running out -- fast,"" the source told Life & Style via Radar Online.  ""Nobody seems to know how Juan Pablo makes a living. During the week he spends his time going to the gym or the beach. His life in Miami seems rather mundane.""In addition, the source claims that Galavis is not quite ready to commit. This is not the first report that the 32-year-old Venezuelan is extra friendly.""Since filming wrapped, Juan Pablo's been caught getting cozy with at least three women,"" the source continued.Galavis' is also reportedly getting cozy with the mother of his children, Carla Rodriguez.""They share a bond that appears to extend beyond their daughter,"" the source claimed.SPOILER ALERT: The finale of The Bachelor airs Monday at 8/7c on ABC. According to Star-Spin, Nikki will win the final rose. The site claims that Galavis and Nikki never got engaged but are still together. LALATE, however, claims that Galavis is now flirting with others.Recently, host Chris Harrison shared his opinions on the Bachelor.""Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemy,"" he told TV Guide. ""Whether this was a good fit or not or the best decision, I feel like he's fought it. For me, he gets really defensive and short and that's when he says, 'OK' or 'perfect,' whereas normally you'd have a response. He either gets defensive or goes into dad mode and he talks to them like they're his daughter, and says things like, 'Don't be sad,' and touches their hair.""Follow Scharon Harding on Twitter: @SH____4.TagsABC, The Bachelor, The Bachelor Season 18, Juan Pablo Galavis, Carla Rodriguez frank rubio National Hydrocarbons Commission Disney Channel's newest star is adding diversity to the channel and empowering girls her age through her lead role in ""Stuck in the Middle."" 4:44 hassan jameel Get ready for the final matchup of the big tournament.CategoriesCategoriesFollow Us"	Entertainment
447	"Ugh. Are you kidding me? I know we really shouldn't be all that shocked or anything, but Juan Pablo Galavis made another offensive comment, basically destroying any hope that was left of him actually having fans by the end of his season of The Bachelor.He's pulled the language barrier card over and over again to dig himself out of sticky situations, and up until now, I've sort of bought the excuse. A little bit. (I mean, have you heard his English? It's really not great.)But this time, he went and used the dreaded ""R"" word -- and I'm really not sure he's going to be able to recover from this one.Here's how it all went down. Juan P. retweeted this ""joke"" that was posted by a fan.Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you’re f**king special to me, you’re my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!And then all hell broke lose, because his retweet was accompanied by, ""JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT …""(Wait. He loved it? I thought he didn't even understand it. Whatever.)As you can imagine, people went nuts after seeing this -- but then he dug himself into an even deeper hole by trying to defend himself.First he reminded everyone that English isn't his thing. And then he told people they need to chill out and ""enjoy jokes and sarcasm."" Then he followed up with this little gem:In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #RespectRelax? Um. Ok.Let me see if I have this straight. According to Juan Pablo, referring to gay people as ""more pervert"" isn't offensive. And neither is calling someone a retard.Got it. (Ess ok.)At this point, the dude should probably just quit while he's ahead and skip the ""After the Final Rose"" special all together -- because he's going to be absolutely torn to pieces.Heck, he might want to think about taking a little vaca from the U.S. at least until The Bachelorette starts and we have a new person to obsess over and loathe.I hear Venezuela is nice this time of year. (Just a suggestion.)Are you offended by Juan Pablo's latest comment?  Image via ABC

449	Tomorrow, tomorrow, The Bachelor finale is tomorrow. It’s only a day ah-way! Okay, that’s enough. Perhaps I should let Juan Pablo’s phone do the singing.In day four of our countdown to the Bachelor finale, we’ve got an exclusive look at a deleted scene involving Juan Pablo and what appears to be his signature move. In this clip, Juan Pablo pulls out his phone and plays Nikki a song, the same way he pulled out a phone and played Clare a song in Saturday’s clip.But this time, instead of him playing a song his significant other already knows, Juan Pablo picks a song specifically for Nikki. And with lyrics like, “‘Cause you’re the only one for me; your love is like the deep blue sea,” we don’t blame Nikki for feeling reassured. But when he starts to sing along? Yep, he did that with Clare too.Watch the video below:The Bachelor finale airs Monday, March 10, at 8 p.m. on ABC.	Entertainment

451	 TV News Catherine Giudici, Juan Pablo Galavis, Sean Lowe, The Bachelor 0 Comment March 9, 2014In this edition of “crazy rumors regarding ‘The Bachelor,'” we present something that may actually have a little bit of validity to it: A story regarding just how ready ABC and the show’s producers are to move on from the whole Juan Pablo Galavis disaster. In between his attitude on the show and his feelings on homosexuality and the r-word (which stirred up a lot of conversation earlier this week online), the folks over at public relations have been working overtime. Also, you have the editors desperate to still try and show that he is a good guy that should actually be sought after.According to a report from E! News, here are a laundry list of reasons why some powers that be are counting down the minutes until they can move forward and focus fully on “The Bachelorette” (which is likely to star Andi Dorfman from this season).1. The blatant statement from a source that most everyone involved “cannot wait for the season to be over.”2. There are rumors already that he and the woman that he picked at the end of the show are not getting along, which would hardly come along as a surprise. We know that it behooves ABC if the two are still together for the live “After the Final Rose” special, but at the same time, there’s a sadistic part of us interested more in a complete trainwreck where they break up in front of everyone. We don’t want to see heartbreak, but at the same time, it’s been hard to see how emotionally invested anyone really is with this season so far.3. Producers were extremely upset over how Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici’s wedding was at times overshadowed in the press by the comments Juan Pablo said about a gay Bachelor: “His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici’s wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine’s special weekend.” This quote sounds a little dramatic since the wedding special still seemed perfectly fine for the bride and groom, but maybe this quote is more of the smoking gun into why Juan Pablo, who was at one point invited to the wedding, was not in attendance.You can get some more evidence about the disdain for Juan Pablo’s decision-making from Chris Harrison here, as he chided him earlier this season for flip-flopping on Clare Crawley.

456	 TV News Clare Crawley, Juan Pablo Galavis, The Bachelor 0 Comment March 8, 2014This entire season of “The Bachelor” has been an utter mess from start to finish, and there is really only one person that you can look at as a major reason why: Juan Pablo Galavis. This is the guy who has been at the center of everything, and to call him a letdown would be being far too kind. Instead, he has sank the show like a lead balloon, blamed his language barrier and culture differences for everything, and also apparently even annoyed a guy in Chris Harrison who is almost always on the side of his leading men and women.So what did Juan Pablo do in this case that was so egregious? Entertainment Weekly posted a new behind-the-scenes video recently from earlier this season, and it is intense enough to stand out even in the midst of all the other crazy stuff that has happened as of late. Harrison is none too pleased about the fact that Juan Pablo completely told off Clare Crawley for making out with him in the ocean. The horror! This was a PG-rated romantic comedy compared to what Ben Flajnik did with Courtney Robertson.Harrison actually comes off better in this video that he does most of the time on “The Bachelor,” and it’s quite a bummer that this didn’t make it on the broadcast itself. It shows that he is a little more fair to the women than some of the we-don’t-watch-the-show-but-still-criticize-it pundits would like you to think. It also helps to further along the idea that most people with this season probably cannot wait for this to be over. Sean Lowe at this point may as well be Sir Galahad in comparison.Regardless of whatever we think about this season, it is still our duty to give you more scoop! Plus, we cannot help ourselves.

458	All right Bachelor fans: We are five days away from what ABC is promising will be an explosive and contentious season finale. To celebrate, we thought we’d start the fireworks early and show you some of the scenes that got cut from this season’s roller coaster ride of love. Starting now and going through Monday, we will release a new, never-before-seen deleted scene each day. Buckle up, rose lovers: This ride isn’t over yet!For day one of our countdown, we have a clip of Chris Harrison and Juan Pablo discussing this season’s most talked about moment: Juan Pablo’s late-night swim with Clare. At the rose ceremony, just after Juan Pablo left Clare in tears, Chris confronted him about how the Bachelor “devastated” Clare. As Chris put it: “You really think Camila’s going to be upset if she found you swimming at night?” Suffice it to say that Juan Pablo’s answer didn’t exactly put Chris at ease.Is this the first time in Bachelor history that Chris really doesn’t like the guy sitting across from him? Decide for yourself by watching below.So, will you accept this video?The Bachelor finale airs Monday, March 10 at 8 p.m. on ABC.	Entertainment

467	"The Bachelor's final two Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley are being criticized today for their decision to fight for Juan Pablo Galavis. His offensive comments about the gay community, mentally ill people and contestant Andi Dorfman have upset fans of the ABC reality show more than almost any other Bachelor before. Juan Pablo's excuse? English is his second language, he says. Andi dumped Juan Pablo after a nightmare Fantasy Suite date in one of the most dramatic Bachelor exits we've ever seen. Heartbroken and fuming, Andi tried to explain to Juan Pablo that he wasn't getting it. She felt hurt and stupid after spending an evening with him and taking time off from her high-powered career as an assistant district attorney.RELATED: 'Bachelor' Finale Shocker! Was Juan Pablo Faking It All Along?In a somewhat vicious breakup, Andi slammed Juan Pablo saying she “can’t stand"" being with him. After laying in bed awake next to him as he slept, Andi realized Juan Pablo couldn't care less about her thoughts on religion or politics, she said. “It’s important for me to be with a guy who loves me more than he loves himself.”


Andi showed her tough side while dumping Juan Pablo on 'The Bachelor.'


Andi's complaint about Juan Pablo is nothing new. All season, everyone but Nikki, Clare and Renee has called the Bachelor for being stupid, shallow, insensitive, hurtful and fake (not necessarily in that order). But are the criticisms of Juan Pablo just sour grapes because Clare and Nikki are the final two?RELATED: 'After The Final Rose' Crazy! Was Juan Pablo On The Show To Find A Wife? That's what Bachelor host Chris Harrison was trying to figure out on the ""Women Tell All"" episode. ""Clearly, Juan Pablo [is] an attractive man,"" Harrison told the contestants. ""Why wasn't that enough?""Andi was the first to respond, saying: ""At the end of the day,"" she said. ""Those looks can fade, and you need something more than that."" 


L - R: Andi, Renee and Sharleen sat in the front row during the 'Women Tell All' episode, and they didn't mince words. 


Sharleen, the opera singer who dumped Juan Pablo before Andi did, was surprisingly sweet when talking about Juan Pablo on the ""Women Tell All"". But even she admitted that the Bachelor has two personalities. When asked if it was wrong to blame Clare for hooking up in the ocean at 4:00 a.m., she said: ""I think he had a case of buyer's remorse. He didn't man up the way he should have.""In the first three - four episodes of Season 18, it really seemed like Juan Pablo was too good to be true. Between his chiseled abs and adorable stories about his daughter, Camila, he seemed like the perfect package (no pun intended).RELATED: The 'Women Tell All' On Heated EpisodeBut over time, as the contestants got to know the Bachelor better, they started to question his motives for being on the show. Andi wasn't sure he was really looking for a wife. Sharleen questioned whether he could have deep, ""cerebral"" conversations. Renee wondered why he would kiss other women and not her. 


Juan Pablo will give his final rose to Nikki or Clare, above, on this week's Bachelor finale.


Juan Pablo also seemed to backtrack on the Fantasy Suite date with Clare. She told him she was nervous about going to the Fantasy Suite because he said he didn't want to upset his daughter, Camila. This time — when the cameras would not be rolling in the hotel room — Juan Pablo changed his tune. He insisted this is how they would truly get to know one another. The buzz is that Juan Pablo and Clare did sleep together in the ocean, Fantasy Suite or both. Sleeping with contestants during filming has long been frowned upon. Many Bachelor fans feel that, because it's part of a television show and women are trying to win a competition, that sleeping with a woman is not only sleazy but also unfair. It creates an unfair advantage and pressure, they argue.RELATED: Bachelor Hometown Dates Lead To Crazy DramaThe contestants also questioned Juan Pablo's decision to meet Renee's son, Ben, if he wasn't going to give her a rose. And many viewers thought it was terribly unfair to Camila — and the rest of the contestants — that the Bachelor introduced Nikki to her so early on.


Juan Pablo, seen here with Bachelor finalist Nikki, defended his R-word joke on Twitter.


He defended his decision by saying he often introduces people he's dating to Camila as ""his friends."" Moms everywhere still question whether the move was a good idea.Now that we're at the end of a season filled with crying and catfights, Nikki and Clare are competing for a questionable prize. Even if Juan Pablo is, in fact, in it for the right reasons, he seems to misstep and change his words. It's hard to trust a man who says one thing and does another. Isn't it?View the discussion thread. Like or Follow us for updates on the biggest stories!"	Entertainment

At this point, we’re not sure whether we want Children’s Mercy nurse Nikki Ferrell to win this season’s “The Bachelor.” In case you haven’t been following the mayhem surrounding one of the least-favorite bachelors of all time, walk down that rose-strewn memory lane with us today. The season finale begins at 7 p.m. Monday on ABC.
Nikki Ferrell
 Age: 26 Hometown: Kearney, Mo. Occupation: Pediatric nurse Most memorable: Her catfight with rival Clare, who Nikki said “claimed some territory that might not be hers.” Also, those awful dance moves. He likes her because: She’s “sexy” and “cute” and sees her as wife material. Why she should lose: The KC nurse is smart, young and well-spoken; everything Juan Pablo isn’t. Why she should win: She was the only girl Juan Pablo introduced to his daughter and has plenty of experience with kids.
Clare Crawley
 Age: 32 Hometown: Sacramento, Calif. Occupation: Hair stylist Most memorable moment: The now-infamous nighttime swim in the ocean with Juan Pablo after which he shamed her on national TV. And she still stayed. He likes her because: She’s apparent"	Entertainment

472	"2014 Season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo is without a doubt the most hated and disappointing lead the reality show has ever had. The contestants seem to hate Galavis for being disingenuous about seriously wanting to settle down. The crew thinks he is a womanizer, and the producers are tired of his total diva mentality. Spoilers: No matter which one of the girls is the winner; there is no ring to really win on this season's Bachelor.Venezuela-born Juan Pablo is quick to blame any misunderstandings or criticism on miscommunication, but the rest of the Bachelor crew tend to disagree with him.An insider on the show told OK! that Galavis is universally disliked by all the behinds the scene staff, because of the way he treats everyone:""The producers despise Juan Pablo! He was a total diva on set, throwing temper tantrums daily.""A bad signal on his phone made him explode...Another time he almost reduced a junior runner to tears over cufflinks.""Another show production whistleblower told OK! that it wasn't just his behaviors, but his constant demands for more money that really had some people regretting ever greenlighting Juan Pablo for Bachelor:""There's no doubt that he's in it for more fame. Love is not his number one goal.""[Galavis] demanded more money than any other Bachelor contestant and wanted obscene amounts of per diem and free clothes.""It's all the concern for himself and no one else that has caused the genteel ladies to turn against him publicly claims a source in In Touch:""The girls think he's an ass...Initially he comes across as very charming, but as you get to know him, you can tell he is not sincere.""They want to humiliate him now.""But 2009 Bachelorette Jillian Harris thinks the world outside the set shouldn't be too quick to judge Galavis based solely by what they have seen on television (via OK! Magazine):""[Juan Pablo] is really is different...He has very strong opinions, is stubborn and set in his ways.""But I don't think he's got bad intentions.""Yeah whatever, he's a slut.About the Author                           Tags2014, Bachelor, Juan Pablo, Season 18, Spoilers, Girls.

473	If Juan Pablo Galavis is trying to become the most-hated Bachelor yet, it’s working.Hot on the heels of homophobic comments he made in January that enraged the public, Juan has done it again — this time mocking the mentally disabled.On Thursday Juan Pablo retweeted an insensitive joke made by a fan that read:“Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I’ve done. I don’t care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you’re f**king special to me, you’re my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!”Not only did the controversial 32-year-old retweet the offensive message, but he then replied to it.“JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT…” he wrote — and then later deleted after being slammed with criticism by the public.Juan then tried to defend himself on Thursday, claiming his poor English was to blame.I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese… For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN… #Culture— Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 6, 2014Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES… People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM… He even went on to claim that in his home country of Venezuela, “retard” is not an offensive word.In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone… #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect— Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 7, 2014But the damage is done, and coupled with his stance that the Bachelor should never have a gay contestant because homosexuals are more “pervert in a sense,” the former soccer pro has quickly become one of the franchise’s most criticized contestant to date.The season finale of The Bachelor airs on Monday, March 10.

477	"Juan Pablo is in hot water again, however this time it’s due to his antics with the women of “The Bachelor.” JP, who has sky rocketed to fame as the first Latino “Bachelor” finds himself at the center of another controversy when he retweeted a fan on Thursday that wrote a rather thoughtless joke on the social media site, the joke was poking fun at people who suffer from mental handicaps, and plainly was just insensitive. The joke, which to clarify was not written by Juan Pablo, but was retweeted to his Twitter profile read, ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!"" After posting the tactless poem to his profile, Juan Pablo added “""JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..."" however since the backlash his comment of intense laughter and praise has since been deleted.After receiving an angry barrage of messages via Twitter, Juan Pablo went back on the site in an effort to defend himself writing, ""I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK English and a LITTLE bit of Portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture."" The star of ABC’s hugely popular dating seris continued his rant stating, ""Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES... People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect."" What Juan Pablo is perhaps missing is that not only was his word choice offensive, the indication that all those with mental disability lack the competence to read and not feed themselves crayons is just completely outlandish. Juan Pablo needs a stern lesson in the way of the world, and even is defense of his tweet was lacking claiming the difference in language to be the major cause for concern. The implication and insensitive nature of the joke is offensive, in addition to his use of the r-word.Juan Pablo’s apology/defense of this joke continued throughout the day with the singe dad also tweeting, ""Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture."" His hastags may be the most telling pat of this apoplgy, which truly shine light on the issue of jokes of this nature. By urging most likely Americans and fans of The Bachelor” to “learn culture” Juan Pablo should take a piece of his own advice and realize that America is a very politically correct country that actively works to openly accept all people. Moreover the insistence to “open your mind” is truly laughable considering Juan Pablo himself is too ignorant to see what hurtful words and comments can do to those who are perhaps already suffering. Do I think he intentionally meant to offend anyone? No-but he should perhaps take some of his own advice and open his mind to the culture of the US and learn acceptance. Donovan Longo, staff reporter, joined the Latin Times team in February 2013 and has quickly become our resident pop culture expert.

					By Robyn Ross | Mar 6, 2014 4:45 PM EST It's no secret there's been a ton of negativity surrounding this season of The Bachelor. But while fans, celebrity and otherwise, have shared their distaste for Season 18 star Juan Pablo, it's also been one of the most talked-about seasons in the series' 14-year history. Which begs the question: Does a detested Bachelor actually make for a more successful season?The Bachelor: Where are they now?When host Chris Harrison announced on The Bachelorette's After the Final Rose special in August that Juan Pablo was the franchise's newest star, the immediate reaction was mixed. Fans seemed excited to finally have a minority Bachelor, but Juan Pablo was also viewed by some as a questionable choice. Unlike past seasons that starred a previously rejected contestant, viewers knew very little about Juan Pablo. Eliminated in Week 6 on The Bachelorette without having had a one-on-one date, all we really knew was that Juan Pablo was a former professional soccer player from Venezuela with a 4-year-old daughter. How would he interact with women one-on-one on camera? How would he handle himself in interviews? How was he with his daughter? The only thing anyone knew with relative certainty: Juan Pablo was sexy, which, to be fair, is a very important characteristic when choosing the lead.""You have to go with how you feel at the time and the information you have at the time, and, for us, Juan Pablo was easily the best choice at the time,"" Harrison tells TVGuide.com. Prior to the announcement, TVGuide.com users certainly agreed with that sentiment, as Juan Pablo received 40 percent of nearly 10,000 votes cast about who should be the next Bachelor. The Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemyHeading into the January season premiere, ABC played up Juan Pablo's Latin background with its ""Juan-uary"" promos. The network even announced three Sunday specials, culminating in a three-year ratings high for the show's premiere. But then came controversy. Just before the third episode, Juan Pablo infamously said in an interview that he didn't think the show should have a gay or bisexual star because gay people were ""more pervert."" The soundbite made headlines everywhere, and angry viewers and non-fans alike tweeted their disgust. Juan Pablo posted an apology, but the dust never really settled.A couple weeks later, viewers were talking about Juan Pablo's late-night swim with Clare, which Juan Pablo later used to shame her. (He claimed he regretted the seemingly innocent rendezvous.) Towards the end of the season, another oddity occurred: Contestants left the show because they couldn't see a future with Juan Pablo. Whereas during most seasons the rejected women cried hysterically upon their eliminations, some of this season's ladies were honest in their lack of interest. Notably, opera singer Sharleen exited just before hometown dates saying, ""There's a little voice in my head telling me that this is not right...The idea of proposal doesn't seem like something that is possible for me.""During fantasy suite week, Andi also left the show on her own accord, telling Juan Pablo that he had no respect for her, was immature, and couldn't care less about getting to know her. But, as is often the case, the supposed backlash against Juan Pablo actually translated to more buzz about the show. ""I've done more interviews — random ones from Sports Radio to The New York Times — about this season and the controversy surrounding him, including the remarks off-camera,"" Harrison says. And perhaps even more telling, at the ""Women Tell All"" special, for the first time the fights weren't between the girls, but with the star. (Even the majority of TVGuide.com users for the first time, when asked if Juan Pablo should choose Nikki or Clare, chose neither.)The Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Andi would make a fantastic BacheloretteBut has Juan Pablo actually hurt the franchise? Consider last season's star Sean Lowe, who was arguably the most liked Bachelor to date and who eventually married his winning contestant Catherine on an ABC special. But Sean's season had the lowest-rated premiere in the show's history and his finale garnered 10 million viewers, just a smidge ahead of Ben Flajnik's Season 16 finale, but less than Seasons 13, 14 and 15. (It's worth noting that, after an initial spike generated from Juan Pablo's insensitive comments, viewership has been steadily dropping. Perhaps the Olympics or the return of The Voice are to blame, or maybe viewers lost interest around the same time Sharleen and Andi did.) So, is Juan Pablo truly a ""bad"" Bachelor? ""I don't know how you answer that,"" Harrison says. ""Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven't that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor. ... People want to follow Juan Pablo because he's unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions. Sean's decisions were cut and dry whereas Juan Pablo you're leaving scratching your head. So, a season like this draws you to discuss.Bachelor's Chris Harrison breaks down hometowns, previews Andi's ""nightmare"" fantasy suite""We need you to love the Bachelor or hate the Bachelor because we need you to have an opinion,"" Harrison continues. ""Apathy is what kills us, when you just don't care what happens. With Sean, there weren't any negatives and it was just a matter of who the lucky lady was going to be. With Juan Pablo, it's how are we going to land this plane with no landing gear and the pilot is passed out? I like the fact that there are both ends of the spectrum here. All I hope for is for you to have an opinion about Juan Pablo. Some people love him and will defend him, but then there are those who can't stand him and he gets on their last nerve.""Despite the way his missteps have created buzz, Harrison insists that the producers didn't cast Juan Pablo to be a lightning rod. ""We didn't go into Juan Pablo's season thinking this guy is going to be really controversial on- and off-camera,"" Harrison says. ""We thought he'd be the Latin version of Sean. [We thought,] he's a good family man looking for love, and turns out he's not in the way Sean was.""So, looking back, would Harrison have done it differently? ""I have no regrets about him being the Bachelor,"" Harrison says. ""It's a very different season, and, in my opinion, not a bad season. He's not a bad guy. When you have a very specific Bachelor with a different culture, a somewhat different language, yes it's going to narrow down the field and the women who will fall for this guy. But I think it's been very interesting. I can't even explain what a different journey this was for me and our fans. We're on a roller coaster and we're all just hanging on for dear life and have no idea what's coming next.""The Bachelor's three-hour finale airs on Monday at 8/7c on ABC. What did you think of this season?

God forbid Perez should ever use the ""f"" word huh ? oh wait……
There's this crazy new thing called the Google machine…check it out sometime!Perez, is that these tweetes messages were addressed to you?This guy seems to take life a bit too seriously, especially when he seems to look at ""the big picture"" by including his own person in the equation.
In fact, this guy is not ugly at first glance. But as the proverb says: ""Great beauty, a formidable force, great riches are not really of great interest. A right heart exceeds all.
This guy is a piece of work. He doesn't want to show his daughter kissing a girl but he will have her hold a gun at 4 years old. What shows a better example?!?!
Please, how petty. You don't know what he meant or whom it was sent to….Have you
ever heard the term private joke?…Not everyone can be as Perfect or politically correct
as you perez. I love you to hear what people say when they are driving….you're
such a petty person.
If you don't like what Perez posts why did you sign up for his page?? Just to trash him huh? You don't look any better than the people he posts about. I read his page when there's crazy stories about the lifestyles of the ""Rich and famous.""…..Instead of Perez for his posts, show links where it shows he was incorrect. Oh, but that would be too much work for you wouldn't it?Your comments just look like you have/like to hate. And it looks like you'll sign up to do it. Sad. (Now begin trashing me and calling me names, like you do to Perez, I mean that's why you're apparently here, and I've given you a gold mine)
everyone needs to calm down all these sayings are from an internet meme. my gf sent it to me months ago so this is clearly just a joke between him and his friends as it was between me and my friend and not meant to in the context of him thinking you should be laughing at handicapped people.  people need to lighten up and not take everything so serious!
these are legitimate jokes i have heard since i was in grade 2… get over it. ugh i am so sick of this shit.
nobody worried about the gun he is letting this girl handle?
Re: patrick –  Nothing wrong in that, He was just practicing his little brat to shoot with a gun in anticipation of a forthcoming invasion of zombies. When the majority of the world will become homosexual they will change into zombies hungry for the flesh of heterosexual.
he didnt even tweet them he retweeted them
U ignorant people how dare him make fun off mental retardation stay out of america your not that hot any ways my son is autistic and hes smarter than pablo will ever be!!!! O and im a lesbian to so make fun of that way to be a good example you must be desperate u cant get a girl from ur own poor country stay out of us btw my son is way prettier than your ugly family
Re: Douche Hunter –  fuck u to Re: tacogirl –  u fucking stupid poor america what has this come to
None of those are his original comments, thousands have tweeted or meme shared those quotes …he may have found them funny but he isn't to blame for the statement
I've seen that joke many times and it's pretty old too. It's usually sent in a text msg chain that you send to your close silly for ends an it is funny and has NOTHING to do with disabled children. Where in that joke was a disabled child referenced??!! Trust me I know a lot of mentally ""normal"" people that are not children that lick windows and ear crayons! It's fucking funny and meant to be a joke to someone you call a dear friend that does retarded stupid shit. I will never tolarate someone bulling, disrespecting a child that has a mental disability or any child for that matter. I think anyone that would do something like that is completly disgusting but that is not the case in this situation. That's like if you ever called someone stupid out of joking or anger in your life you are making fun of diabled children right? Isn't it the same thing if that's what your saying about Juan Pablo??!! Give me a break! Leave the guy alone! Is daughter will be fine. It will probably affect his daughter in a more adverse way because of what you and all the other media are saying about her dad and her. Juan Pablo isn't my cup of tea but LEAVE HIM ALONE for Petes sake! It was a joke that had nothing to do with disabled children so leave it at that, laugh at it because it IS funny and move the fuck on! Geez!!!!
Re: sarah –  I agree! And sorry everyone for my typos and misspelling I am writing  all of this on my phone and I hate touch screen and auto correct.
Re: erica –  please go read my comment. The joke in question has NOTHING to do with mentally disabled children. Calm down please no need to talk down to people like that especially when you are talking about setting example for children. Oh and go you for being a lesbian I'm all for equal rights!
Juan Pablo's hate for so many vulnerable people is just disgusting. What more do we need to hear? I doubt his pick Nikki would agree, since she's a nurse who works with Down Syndrome patients……what a disgrace this guy is. What a scumbag.
The tide will turn. The ""machine"" that is the show, started to socially construct him negatively by editing things out that were positive, and including things that fit the negative image they were trying to construct of him, in order to distance themselves from him after he made a misconstrued comment about homosexuality.  It's funny actually to watch all these second rate writers and web sites, and so called ""celebrities"" dominate the discussion and the rest of the puppets in the world eat it up as ""truth"". Juan Pablo has been bullied by all the things that were portrayed about him.  All this garbage about ""worst bachelor ever"" is pathetic. He was very respectful and kind to all the women. He didn't drink alcohol and encouraged them not to. He refused to do the two dates thing because he saw it as hurtful to the women. He was so sensitive and kind. He was funny. Just b/c he made a comment outside the show, all of a sudden, like a pack of wild dogs, the show and media turned on him and yes, bit by bit, with each disparaging comment, or cleverly constructed image, they tried to make him seem to be a villain. Shame on ALL of you. To be so readily taken in, to be so manipulated by the powers that be on the show/station; to not think critically about what has happened, is a sad reflection of the level of intelligence in the mainstream!

In the clip, Juan Pablo explains that Andi “wasn’t feeling it.” But when the Bachelor starts to talk about whether the word “default” even exists in his vocabulary, Chris tries to jump in and play Dr. Phil by explaining the real reason Andi left. Does Juan Pablo listen?Watch the video below and find out:The Bachelor finale airs Monday, March 10 at 8 p.m. on ABC.	Entertainment

416 Views He’s not the sharpest tool in the shed, and Juan Pablo Galavis re-posted a completely inappropriate tweet from a fan on Twitter on Thursday (March 6).The “Bachelor” star shared, “Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r—–d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f–ked up friend, just as I’ve done. I don’t care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you’re f–king special to me, you’re my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!”After posting the message, Juan added the comment, “JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT…” despite the fact that it was totally offensive to persons with mental handicaps.And following a firestorm of criticism, Galavis deleted the tweet and posted a defense- “I’m BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese… For those who DON’T I recommend to LEARN… #Culture.”“Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES… People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM… In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone… #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect.”He added, “Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD… The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there… #openyourmind #learnculture.”December 10, 2015January 6, 2015January 5, 2015Your email address will not be published.

484	After a dramatic season full of tears, breakups and crazy drunken meltdowns, Season 18 of “The Bachelor” is coming to a close. On Monday, Juan Pablo will be forced to choose between Clare, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo. And while viewers of the ABC series are dying to know who the single dad will choose, the main focus of the after-show will be on the next “Bachelorette.”As we previously reported, “The Bachelor’s” season finale will run three hours instead of the normal two. But the third and final hour of the show won’t be dedicated to the final rose ceremony. Instead it will be the “After the Final Rose” special.According to a synopsis from ABC, “After the Final Rose” will feature a live sitdown with Juan Pablo and host Chris Harrison as they “discuss his final two women of the season, Clare and Nikki.” Juan Pablo will explain what was going on in his mind during his final few days in St. Lucia, all leading up to the “shocking outcome” of the 2014 “Bachelor” season.Special guests Chelsie, Kat, Kelly, Renee and Sharleen from Juan Pablo’s season of “The Bachelor” will be in the audience, along with former “Bachelor”/ “Bachelorette” success stories Sean and Catherine Lowe, and Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfried. And “After the Final Rose” will feature another mystery guest – the next “Bachelorette.”While the new “Bachelorette’s” name has yet to be released, many “Bachelor” viewers are speculating (and hoping) that Andi Dorfman will be named Juan Pablo’s successor. Andi quickly became a fan favorite in season 18, despite being the last girl to land a one-on-one date. Making it past hometown dates, Andi’s relationship with Juan Pablo went downhill after her overnight fantasy suite date with him turned into a nightmare. Andi accused Juan Pablo of “name dropping,” not listening to her, and telling her that she was in the final three by “default.” The pair had a nasty showdown in St. Lucia before Andi eliminated herself from the competition.And fans aren’t the only ones of Team Andi for “The Bachelorette.” Desiree Hartsock, who was “The Bachelor” in 2013, wrote on her blog that she believes the Atlanta woman will take the torch.“Andi stayed true to how she felt about Juan the day she decided to go home and [stood by her story of] what happened in the fantasy suite,” Des write. “Since she has been a fan favorite throughout this season, I am speculating that she will be the next Bachelorette.”Do you think Andi will be announced as the next “Bachelorette”?

488	"Juan Pablo Galavis’ latest Twitter comments have him in trouble once again. This time, the Bachelor star is being  criticized for retweeting an inappropriate joke that used the R-word.The retweet in question has since been deleted, but it apparently said, “Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy!” Juan Pablo Galavis also added that he “LOVED” the joke.RELATED: Are Nikki And Clare Crazy For Staying On 'The Bachelor'?Juan Pablo Galavis’ response to this R-word Twitter joke sparked immediate backlash from followers. But instead of apologizing for his statement, the Bachelor star blamed his actions on the differences between American and Venezuelan culture.“Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES,” Juan Pablo wrote in a series of tweets. “I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese...,” Juan Pablo Galavis wrote in a series of tweets. “For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture. Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture.”RELATED: Fantasy Suite Shocker Changes Everything On The Bachelor


Juan Pablo, seen here with Bachelor finalist Nikki, defended his R-word joke on Twitter.


But apparently, Juan Pablo’s Twitter plea was not that convincing. One user named @Finzup75 got into a particularly heated online discussion with the former soccer player. She later claimed that she had a sister with Down Syndrome and was thus particularly offended by the Bachelor star’s use of the r-word.“YOU are not in VENEZUELA, dips—t,” @Finzup75 replied to Juan Pablo’s R-word explanation. “[The r-word] is hugely offensive here. How about you respect people with disabilities?”RELATED: Nikki, Clare Can't Stop Fighting On The BachelorJuan Pablo then tweeted back, “UNFOLLOW me and you will be happy... Im Venezuelan and Twitter is WORLDWIDE..”But once again, @Finzup75 was not convinced. She continued to slam Juan Pablo over his R-word joke.“DIPS--T, you are starring on an AMERICAN show! Show a little sensitivity!” she added.


Juan Pablo will give his final rose to Nikki or Clare, above, on this week's Bachelor finale.


Still, some defended Juan Pablo following  this R-word Twitter joke. A follower named Dominique_Pinto wrote, “people that are so sensitive shouldn't be on social media!” The Bachelor star retweeted this reply, along with his trademark “It’s OK” response.Ironically, Juan Pablo’s R-word joke came just days after the national “Spread The Word To End The Word” Day. The annual awareness event calls for the end of derogatory uses of the R-word.This R-word scandal is not the first time Juan Pablo’s comments have caused controversy. Earlier this year, the reality star was asked whether there would ever be a gay Bachelor. Many viewed his response as homophobic.“I respect them, but honestly I don’t think it’s a good example for kids to watch that on TV,” Juan Pablo said of gays. It’s hard. It’s a very thin line. … And there’s this thing about gay people that uh, it seems to me, you know — and I don’t know if I’m more mistaken or not — I mean, great … I have a lot of friends … but they’re more ‘pervert’ in a sense, and to me the show will be too strong — too hard, to watch on TV.”Juan Pablo later apologized for these statements, blaming them on the language barrier. But this did not stop the Bachelorettes, especially Kelly Travis, from calling him out on these statements during this week’s ""Women Tell All"" special. If word of the Bachelor’s R-word joke goes just as viral, we can only imagine the ladies will have something to say about it during next week’s ""After The Final Rose.""Watch Juan Pablo discuss his anti-gay remarks below.View the discussion thread.

News.Fans immediately took to social media, criticizing the star for the post, and the tweet has since been deleted.Juan Pablo caused a stir back in January when he told a reporter he didn’t think a gay or bisexual Bachelor would set a good example for kids because gays were more, “pervert, in a sense.”The reality star attempted to rectify the situation by blaming the comments on a language barrier, saying that the word “pervert” in Spanish is not as offensive. He used the same excuse this time around, blaming his latest tweet on cultural differences.“In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,” he wrote. “Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture”He posted several other message stating that his English is not that great.Galavis has been heavily criticized during his season on the ABC dating series, and two women have left the competition, proclaiming they didn’t want to date him. “The Bachelor” finale airs next Monday night on ABC.Ron White's UGLY splitMeet JLaw's MUCH older beauBourdain: I'd poison TrumpEx reveals truth about PrattRowling RIPPED over TrumpCarrie's shocking autopsy results'Bachelor' twins shockHow Drew recoveredThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

That does not mean that The Bachelorette 2014 has to be from this current season, but we all know ABC likes to share among the shows.It all depends on what happens at The Bachelor 2014 finale and who Juan Pablo picks as the winner and maybe the runner-up will move into the role as The Bachelorette 2014?

		                                     Recent immigrants who barely speak English seem to make fewer gaffes with the English language than American-born Juan Pablo Galavis.“The Bachelor” star, who grew up in Venezuela, once again blamed his background after he came under fire for making light of offensive language. Galavis encountered a backlash after he retweeted someone apparently poking fun at the mentally handicap and who used the r word.""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can,” said the tweet. “Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r***** can read, but look at you go, little buddy!”Galavis not only retweeted it, but he also wrote: “Loved it.”Galavis brushed off the controversy, and blamed his poor choice of words on the fact that English is his second language.“In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone… #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,” he wrote on Twitter.He later deleted the tweet, though he told his followers to “learn culture.”It wasn’t the first time a statement landed ""The Bachelor"" in hot water. Earlier this year, he said he opposed having a gay “Bachelor” because homosexuals were “perverts, in a sense.” He later apologized and blamed his choice of words on a language barrier.Follow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino Like us at facebook.com/foxnewslatinoRon White's UGLY splitMeet JLaw's MUCH older beauBourdain: I'd poison TrumpEx reveals truth about PrattRowling RIPPED over TrumpCarrie's shocking autopsy results'Bachelor' twins shockHow Drew recoveredThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

503	"“The Bachelor” premiered on March, 25, 2002 on ABC, with the premise of 25 women competing for the heart of one man. Hosted by Chris Harrison, the show has The Bachelor go on a series of dates with groups of women, as well as on individual dates, all in the hope of finding a wife. The elimination process consists of a rose ceremony, in which roses are handed out to the women who The Bachelor chooses to keep on the show. Those who don’t receives flowers at each week’s “rose ceremony” are sent home. At the end of each season, “The Bachelor” must choose between two women, with the expectation that he’ll propose to one of them.The contestants live in “Villa De La Vina,” a mansion in Agoura Hills, California, for the first two weeks of filming. The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.  The first “Bachelor” was Alex Michel. At the end of the first season, Michel had to chose between Amanda Marsh and Trista Rehn, better known now as Trista Sutter. Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.” The series has featured a slew of hunky and memorable Bachelors over the years including, Andrew Firestone, Lorenzo Borghese, Charlie O’Connell, Bob Guiney, Brad Womack, Jason Mesnick, Jake Pavelka, Sean Lowe, Juan Pablo Galavis and Ben Higgins. It has has also spawned three spin-off series on ABC. “The Bachelorette” debuted in January 2003 with Rehn as its inaugural star. “Bachelor Pad,” where previous contestants competed for a cash prize of $250,000, debuted on August 9, 2010. And “Bachelor in Paradise,” which also features previous contestants from both “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in an exotic locale, first aired on August 4, 2014.Though “The Bachelor” has earned a reputation for not having the relationships work out, there have been a few high-profile weddings during its run. Rehn, Mesnick, Hebert, and Lowe have all had weddings specials air on ABC.February 5th, 2018January 29th, 2018January 22nd, 2018January 15th, 2018January 8th, 2018January 2nd, 2018January 1st, 2018January 1st, 2018September 7th, 2017August 31st, 2017August 25th, 2017August 25th, 2017June 15th, 2017May 15th, 2017March 28th, 2017« Previous

Will he propose? Well, the monetary offer is on the table for him too. Should be interesting,” he said.Renee, Chelsie, Kelly, and Sharleen will all be in attendance at the ceremony.The blogger also says that Andi Dorfman will be announced as the next “Bachelorette” on the ATFR.Several other media outlets, including TMZ and WSB have confirmed that part.

509	Canadians will soon need to pay more to watch series and movies on Netflix. The company has raised the price of its plans for both new and existing users. While the rise has been already implemented for new subscribers, existing users will be notified through email before new rates are charged from them.In a statement released by Netflix, the company cited addition of new content and introduction of new features and services as the reasons behind the price rise. It said that Netflix adjusts the pricing of its packages from time to time as they introduce new movies, exclusive TV series and upgrade their platform to offer better services to its customers.The company has a huge database of content and also produces its own original content which has become popular like House of Cards. It also has a large number of movies sourced exclusively from international film festivals. Few of USA TV shows are also aired by Netflix in Canada like CW’s Riverdale and ABC’s Scandal.Netflix has a growing market in Canada and in 2016 it had around 5.2 million subscriptions. The television streaming market is quite competitive in Canada and many leading names are fighting out with each other.Brands like Amazon prime are quite a hit in the country having Canadian airing rights of highly rated shows such as American Gods and Mr. Robot. CBS All Access is also set to enter the Canadian market sometime in 2018 with its 9,000 episodes from various shows. The multiple numbers of competitors and the fight to acquire rights for shows has increased the acquisition cost of the content. Though Netflix did not mention it in their statement, still it is a situation faced by all companies in Canadian television industry.Netflix increased their prices last year in May while introducing the feature of streaming in high quality on multiple devices. This time the increase has been $1 for the basic plan making it $8.99 per month. Users can only stream standard quality videos on a single device at a time. The cost of the standard plan has also gone up by $1 ($10.99 per month) which permits subscribers to access content on two screens. Subscribers of the premium plan now have to shell out a monthly $13.99, which is a $2 increase from the previous price. Users can view high definition 4k videos simultaneously on four screens with this plan.The company changes its prices based on local market conditions in a country. The Australian subscribers had to pay few dollars more after Netflix raised the prices in June countering the increase in local taxes. It remains to be seen how the users will respond to the move.TV streaming service in Canada will get a major boost next year with the introduction of CBS Corp’s CBS All Access service. It is the company’s bid to go international that prompted the move and gave Canada the first opportunity to enjoy its content.The online streaming service in the US has a huge database of content and around 9,000 episodes from its various series. Viewers will also get access to special CBS channels like Showtime without requiring a cable connection. Apart from television activities, those who fond of games playing can try out one of the secure Canadian source NBSO online casino games list website. It is free and has a high level of reliability (si vous parlez français, essayez de choisir des jeux sur le site web du guide spécial casino en ligne, qui est fiable et gratuit).CBS corp. has a good chance of creating a considerable grab on the market but it lacks on one ground. The copyrights of many of its shows are already purchased by Canadian broadcasters like Rogers Communications Inc., BCE Inc. and Corus Entertainment Inc. So viewers will not get to see shows like Survivor or The Big Bang Theory and some of the shows are also aired on Netflix. The restricted content may impact the number of subscribers the company is expecting.We have to wait and see as CBS predicts they are going to have 4 million subscriptions by the end of this year. It is interesting to note that TV viewership is declining in Canada and online streaming services are giving a tough competition to the traditional form. In 2016, the volume of subscribers reduced by 1% and reached 11.1 billion viewers and the revenue fell by 2% amounting to $8.7 billion, according to the data from Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.On the other hand, online streaming services have gained increased number of subscriptions. Netflix recorded a growth of 52 million viewers in US alone and another 52 million from all over the world. Compared to that, 158,000 people in Canada disconnected their cable service in 2015. It can be expected that the market is ripe for online streaming in Canada and other players like Hulu and HBO Go may join the competition in some years.With so many providers in the game, the price is also a big factor in getting subscriptions. CBS did not reveal the rates they will charge in Canada, but in the US current rates are $5.99 per month. To get a commercial free version, viewers have to pay $9.99. If the rates are any higher, then Canadian may not be too interested in joining up considering the limitation of content.Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS said that they were aware of the potential of online streaming judging the success of their competitors. The introduction of the service in Canada gives them the chance to directly reach the viewer on an increased scale which can be expanded globally. CBS All Access had achieved a growing domestic market and now is ready with their premium content to hit the international arena.Auto insurance provider Intact Insurance in Nova Scotia plan to use mobile apps to track driver habits to determine the premium rates in the future. Based on the way one drives, they can be eligible for a 25% savings on their insurance premium!The idea may sound out of a science fiction movie but the concept has existed for some time. Many companies like Intact Insurance offer a plug in dongles for vehicles which are used to track driver habits. Intact insurance revealed that the dongle program included 350,000 participants from all over the country. It was introduced at N.S in 2014.However, they are not always the practical solution due to various reasons.First is the cost that prohibits their universal use and in some cases, the devices are not returned to the company. They can also be lost adding to the cost of the company. Another reason is the dongles track the habits of any driver that gets behind the wheel and it is not possible to distinguish between them.Mobile apps have many unique advantages that make them a pragmatic solution for the insurance companies. The app would be using the smart phone of the driver and eliminate any expense on part of the insurance provider. They will also be able to specifically track the habits of the insurance payer which is their priority. It will only monitor the main driver as the app will be linked to his mobile phone.The tool will be used to track aspects of sudden accelerations, hard braking, night driving utilizing the GPS feature of the phones. Intact Insurance applied for permission to launch the program from the N.S Utility and Review Board which was granted on August 4. The company plans to launch the service next month starting September. The initiative will be a way to reward drivers with good habits and give them lower insurance rates for their performance.For the time being, the app or the dongle insurance rates are optional in Canada. But according to experts, a day may come when it automatically becomes more preferable considering the costs. With the advance of technology, the companies may increase the cost of the premium and people will opt for the tracking program for affordability.But not all customers may be willing to join the program. It has been seen that many consumers do not prefer to join such programs. Some also practice bad driving habits like speeding or other dangerous stunts which may impact the insurance rates. There are also some apprehensions about the nature of data collected by the app and its usage by the company. But as the insurance industry is regulated it has not misused the user data under its control.	Entertainment

511	"According to E! News, the ""Women Tell All"" special was pretty heavily edited and some of the juiciest drama was left out. During the special, which aired on Mar. 3, fans saw the ladies of ""The Bachelor"" rip into Juan Pablo but viewers got a much tamer version.During the show, several of the ladies called out Juan Pablo for not spending enough time with everyone and really getting to know them. A couple felt like he didn't take the show that seriously. He was also called out for his comments about not wanting a gay Bachelor.E! News was at the taping and dished on which parts was (for whatever reason) cut from the show. The most edited part of the ""Women Tell All"" was JP's conversation with Kelly about why a gay Bachelor wouldn't be a good idea. Kelly was really upset over the comments because she has two fathers.""It was way more heated than what was televised, with Kelly and Juan Pablo fighting over what he said,"" E! wrote.Host Chris Harrison had to jump in, telling Kelly that she would be able to talk to JP more about it after the taping. The sit-down with the Bachelor himself was said to be heavily edited and was a lot more heated than what was aired. Some of the ladies told him he was ""narcissistic"" and ""not genuine.""Juan Pablo reportedly didn't know the ladies were bashing him before he came out because he did not get to see them talking to Chris Harrison but after the taping ended there was no animosity between the ladies and JP. According to E! he hugged and kissed each lady on the cheek after the cameras were off.Last but not least is Sharleen. E!'s scoop on the opera singer is a little odd but reportedly she was ""a bit more frazzled during filming"" and Harrison had to tell her several times to calm down. She also freaked out a little bit when the AC kicked in at the studio.The finale of ""The Bachelor"" airs on ABC Monday at 8 p.m. "	Entertainment

518	"The Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis is biting back after several of his former contestants slammed him on the Women Tell All special that aired earlier this week.Juan Pablo Dating Mystery Woman?Galavis aired out all of his feelings and slammed many of the women on his People magazine blog Tuesday. He first reprimanded the contestants for not putting themselves in his shoes and considering how difficult it is to have to speak to and try to get to know so many women in such a short amount of time.""It's very easy to speak when you only have to focus on one guy, but it's much harder when the guy has to get to know 27 women. It isn't easy to remember all of the conversations or the questions that I ask, but I always tried my best and I wish the women recognized that,"" he wrote.'Bachelor' Contestants Jealous of Clare?He then revealed that he could tell many of the women he eliminated were ""nervous"" when they had conversations with him and knew it would be too hard for them to ""open up"" in that type of environment.""The women I had a better connection and attraction with are the ones that I felt fit more into what I was looking for,"" he said.He specifically called out Victoria for jumping into a conversation during the special and said she has other things to be concerned about.""Ay, Victoria! During my talk with Kelly, Victoria really surprised me. Why did Victoria jump in the conversation? I believe she should have worried more about being sober on the show so she could get to know me rather than say something negative about me when she was there for only four days. Does she know me? Does she know when and where I learned English?""He went on to say that of all of the women on the Women Tell All special, Sharleen and Renee are the ones who know him best. He added that Andi's decision to leave the show after their not-so-romantic evening in St. Lucia did him a favor.Be sure to see who receives the final rose on the 18th season finale of The Bachelor Monday, March 10 at 8/7c on ABC.

""You ain't ready for this jelly, cause you're kind of a prude.""She then goes on to make fun of the reality star for his dancing and drinking skills (or lack thereof) and also makes reference to his anti-gay comments.Ultimately, the song is just for fun, as Aragon repeatedly sings in the clip.""The words in this clip are not meant to sound bitter,"" she croons at the end.

521	"Oh, “The Women Tell All”. By far a more interesting episode of The Bachelor than the finale every season – and I think we all knew this one would be juicy.After fifteen minutes of nonsense, we finally got to the good stuff – the women started to tear Juan Pablo apart for only talking about himself and not asking questions of his girlfriends. Hmm, funny how none of this stuff came up until Andi brought all that up. It was like all the jilted women saw her leave and went “Yeah! That! I never liked him anyway!” Tell that to the tears you shed in the Reject Limo, ladies.First in the hot seat was Sharleen. She sounded intelligent – because she is. I believed that she didn’t know she was Juan Pablo’s favorite, and I believed that all the other women were well aware. Up next was Renee, who generally had good things to say about Juan Pablo. She didn’t love that he waited so long to kiss her, yet was making out with Clare two seconds later. Renee said she’s been dating and is really happy, so yay! She was one of a handful of likable people this season.We were all really waiting to hear from Andi though, right? She said what she thought of Juan Pablo, and it all sounded pretty right on. She doesn’t think he’s a mean-spirited guy, but he’s thoughtless. He said hurtful things because he wasn’t thinking about her feelings.Andi is bound to be the next bachelorette. They ended on a note of basically saying “I think this process could work and I’ll continue to search for love”. I like Andi, but I think she’s a little dull. I don’t know if I’d be interested in seeing her star in the show. What do you guys think?By the time Juan Pablo came out, he’d been pretty harshly critiqued by the women. I thought it was weird how much some of the women harped on the idea of “fair and unfair”. This isn’t recess, guys. Life isn’t fair. He saw the moms differently, he treated them more carefully, get over it.The blooper real was funny – or should I say, it’s OK. Also, all the women I didn’t like were “Team Clare” and all the ones I enjoyed were “Team Nikki”. Anyway, I have a feeling about who will win, but I look forward to seeing Juan Pablo’s mom tell someone next week that he can be rude!

523	"Grab those tissues, “Bachelor” fans! Juan Pablo’s run on the ABC dating show will come to an end on March 10 with not one hour, not two hours, but a three-hour-long final episode.Last time viewers of “The Bachelor” left off, Juan Pablo faced his ex-girlfriends in “The Women Tell All” episode. While Renee and Sharleen had nothing but nice things to say about the 32-year-old single dad, some of the other girls had less than stellar reviews of the Season 18 bachelor. Needless to say, one of said girls was Andi, the assistant attorney journal who broke up with Juan Pablo after their “nightmare” fantasy suite.With the praise and criticism aside from all the ladies, there are currently two women that “Bachelor” fans need to be focusing on – Clare and Nikki. Clare, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo., are the final two women fighting for Juan Pablo. And while both of them are in love with him, Juan Pablo can only give his heart to one of them.According to a leaked synopsis, viewers can look forward to watching the season finale episode alongside a studio audience and special guests: Chelsie, Kat, Kelly, Renee and Sharleen from Season 18 of “The Bachelor,” and recent “Bachelor/Bachelorette” success stories Sean and Catherine Lowe, and Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfried.The season finale episode, which is set in St. Lucia, will reportedly come to a “shocking conclusion” as the single dad “prepares to make one of the most difficult choices of his life.” As previously mentioned, both Nikki and Clare are head over heels for Juan Pablo, but “Andi’s allegations and her early departure” could potentially put their relationships with Juan Pablo at risk.Will the women still believe they have a connection and future with the bachelor? Does the bachelor even have strong enough feelings for either woman to hand out his final rose? And if he has found love – will he propose?Watch the season finale of ""The Bachelor"" when it airs on ABC on March 10 at 8 p.m. Do you think Juan Pablo will propose? Take the poll below or send a tweet to @AmandaTVScoop.    Will Juan Pablo choose to be with Clare in the season finale of ""The Bachelor""? Photo: ABC  Subscribe"	Entertainment

525	"Juan who? Bachelor contestant Renee Oteri found her happily ever after being booted by Juan Pablo Galavis on season 18 of ABC&apos;s hit reality series. The single mom shared an Instagram photo with her fiance (and her engagement ring!) on Monday, Mar. 3.

				PHOTOS: Meet Juan Pablo's bachelorettes!			
""My forever,"" Oteri, 32, wrote beside the picture of the smiling newly-engaged couple. In it, her handsome fiance (who&apos;s been identified by Wetpaint as an ex-military man named Bracy) drapes his arm over her shoulder, as she holds his hand and shows off  her diamond ring.Sources confirmed to Us Weekly last week that Oteri ""couldn&apos;t be happier"" after getting engaged. ""She is so happy and has wanted this with her fiance for a very long time!"" an insider told Us. ""We&apos;re all so happy to see them back together!""

				PHOTOS: The Bachelor -- where are they now?			
""He is always the one everyone wanted to see her with!"" the source added.The beautiful brunette, who was the fourth runner-up in the current season of The Bachelor, made her mark on the show as a single mom — to 8-year-old son Ben — opposite single dad Juan Pablo. ""Her fiance has known Ben since he was a baby,"" another source told Us. ""Renee is so excited to start over with her new family in Seattle.""

				PHOTOS: Biggest Bachelor moments -- breakups, bling, and more!			
During a conference call with reporters on Feb. 15, Oteri opened up about her life with Ben. ""We definitely talk about everything, and I want my son to see love,"" she shared.Although she&apos;s moved on since wrapping up filming for the show back in October, Oteri revealed that unlike other contestants, she has ""nothing negative to say"" about Galavis. ""I still feel the same about him now than I did the moment, you know, I met him.""

528	"Juan Pablo Galavis came on “The Bachelor” to find love, and after a long journey that involved his heart being broken, the single dad is all set to choose between Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley.The current season of the dating reality show will come to a close on Monday, and rumors indicate that Galavis will pick Ferrell as his final choice.But, she might not be too happy once she gets to know Galavis' reality, as luxury accommodations and extravagant foreign trips aren’t part of his life, a source told Life & Style magazine.The 32-year-old is reportedly broke and lives with his parents in Miami.“Most of the money Juan Pablo got from soccer is probably long gone. Money must be tight, because he lives in a three-bedroom apartment with his mom and dad,” the source said, adding that he came on the show to make some money.“The reason he was so interested in being the Bachelor was to make money and become more famous. He’s always actively looking for money and work.”Shedding light on Galavis' career, the source said that currently he works as a sports consultant for the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame. He has active work only during baseball season, and monetary situation becomes a bit tight once the season is over.“During baseball season, he has to travel to different ballparks and try to get Venezuelan players to sign memorabilia he can bring back to the Hall of Fame,” the source said.It is not immediately known if Ferrell and Crawley are aware of Galavis’ reality. But the source feels “the winner is about to be very surprised. She has no idea what she’s in for.”If rumors are to be believed, this news is not going to faze Ferrell, whose relationship with Galavis is said to have fizzled out soon after the finale of the show was filmed. However, it is not known if he being broke was a contributing factor to the alleged split.For a while now, Galavis has been accused of coming on the show to find a girlfriend, and not a wife as he claimed. Andi Dorfman, who walked out on Pablo after their overnight date, recently said that the single dad is filled with negativity, and he came on the show for the wrong reasons.“I think that he was definitely here to find somebody,” Andi said during Monday’s “Women Tell All” episode. “I think he had that genuine want, [but] I think his version of what he was trying to find was different from ours. In my opinion, I think he was trying to find a girlfriend and someone to date and someone to -- after this is all over -- figure out if it's going to work. And I think we all kind of came here to find a husband."""	Entertainment

530	"Chris Harrison. You are making it very hard for me to continue being blindly devoted to you these days. Hot off of Juan Pablo's incendiary talk about the possibility of a gay Bachelor, Chris weighed in on the show's future stars, and what he had to say was the opposite of enlightened. Actually, he went a step FURTHER than our boy Juan Pablo in terms of awfulness. A thing I did not think was actually possible.In a recent interview, Chris ""Suave"" Harrison was asked if The Bachelor would ever consider someone less hunky than their usual stars. You know, someone with a little bit more to love. Chris shot down the prospect of a chubby Bachelor like it was possum in his attic and he was a gun-toting man with a virulent fear of possums, a fear that surmounted reason or the safety concerns regarding shooting a possum in your attic.Chris was dropping cold, hard truth bombs like they were roses and it was the first week of The Bachelor. Chris says that chubby ""isn't attractive"" and T.V., whether we like it or not, is all about looks. It's not that Chris is anti-chubby guys; in fact, when breaking down why it could never work for the show -- he pointed to himself! Chris. You're a total babe. Calm down. Expand your mind and your waistline. Eat this brownie. I like my hosts of reality T.V. with a little something extra to hold onto. Have I gone too far?We can actually chalk up all of Chris's comments to his burgeoning business savvy. Essentially, when it comes to a gay Bachelor, Chris thinks that would be bad for business. Sigh. Give me back the brownie, Chris. I like my hosts socially proactive in their support for marriage equality. He says that this doesn't mean he's anti-gay-marriage, he just thinks that changing up the show is bad for business. Sounds like a weak defense to me.Do you think Chris is being business savvy or just homophobic? Image via Instagram

Chubby guys need not apply to be the Bachelor. CLICK CONTINUE READING FOR MORE!When questioned by New York Times magazine about the possibility of a gay lead, Chris said he's ""100% for equality and gay marriage"" on a ""philosophical level"" but posed the question, ""Is it a good business decision?""""I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.'

534	Should the next bachelor on The Bachelor be gay?Chris Harrison, the host of the ABC reality series The Bachelor since 2002, seems to have some reservations about featuring a gay bachelor on a subsequent season.In an interview in which he was asked about the current bachelor’s controversial comments, Harrison stressed that he is a 100 percent marriage equality supporter, but that business is business what comes to ratings-driven television content:The question is: Is it a good business decision? I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you’ve been making pizzas for 12 years and you’ve made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, ‘Hey, you should make hamburgers.’ Why? I have a great business model, and I don’t know if hamburgers are going to sell… Is our job to break barriers, or is it a business? That’s not for me to answer.”As alluded to above, you may recall that this season’s bachelor, Juan Pablo Galavis, got into hot water when he claimed in an interview that a gay or bisexual bachelor on the show would be “too perverted.”He subsequently apologized to anyone he may have offended, suggesting that his comments were taken out of context. He also noted that English is his second language, “and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words to express myself. What I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept. The show is very racy as it is and I don’t let my 5 year old daughter watch it. Once again, I’m sorry for how my words were taken. I would never disrespect anyone.”In a slight digression, Harrison — who also has hosted The Bachelorette since 2003 — revealed that unlike the norm for reality television, this season’s Bachelor installment involved minimal boozing. Juan Pablo is a teetotaler (or at least didn’t drink during the entire filming) and successfully encouraged the women to avoid drinking as well, explained Harrison.The Bachelor 2014 season finale will air on March 10 during which Juan Pablo will supposedly decide between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell.Are you a fan of Chris Harrison and The Bachelor?

“The Women Tell All”
March 3, 2014You’re terrible and everybody hates you. (ABC)So, here’s how these “Women Tell All” specials are supposed to work: Chris Harrison comes out and blah blahs about some made-up thing called “Bachelor Nation” and we drive around on a party bus “surprising” “viewing parties”  before returning to the studio where a dozen of the rejects who we might kinda sorta remember if we squint hard enough come out and immediately begin attacking one other for being “fake” or “two-faced” or not being on the show “for the right reasons,” there are some montages, some of the women go sit on Chris Harrison’s Couch of Serious Questions, and then the Bachelor comes out to be yelled at by only the most recently rejected women before we get a blooper reel and a glimpse at the finale. And then I spend the next day trying to decipher layers of shrieking and coming up with ha-has while also somehow conveying to you, the reader, all of these idiots’ imagined grievances. That’s how it’s supposed to work.However, somewhat remarkably this season the women all seem to get along, with the notable exception of Niña de Papá and Nurse Nikki, our remaining contestants. And so, with no Ti-Polar or Villainess to take their rejection, embarrassment and disappointment out on, this season, the ladies have turned their attention to the real bad guy in the room: Juan “IS OKAY” Pablo.This is remarkable! Sure, there have been “Women (and Men) Tell All” specials where some of the contestants turn on the Bachelor (and Bachelorette), but those tend to be isolated incidents involving the contestants who were most recently eliminated and thought they really had a chance to win this thing. Those contestants tend to have developed actual feelings for our hero (or heroine) and were left hurt, humiliated and feeling used. But here, these women did not develop any feelings for Juan Pablo other than disillusionment and un poco disgust.How did it come to this? Less than a year ago, Princess Desiree’s “Men Tell All” special’s audience was filled with women screaming for Juan Pablo — in a good way! — and a nation was excited to watch this sexy Venezuelan’s “journey to find love.” But now, having acquainted ourselves with this wishy-washy, homophobic narcissist with a raging madonna/whore complex, the contestants and the audience both have a little less amor for our Latin lover.And las mujeres, they are going to tell him all about it …Unfortunately, we don’t just pull out the knives for Juan Pablo right away. Instead, we begin the special with Dallas Sean and New Age Girl as a much-needed reminder that this show isn’t a complete farce — see? sometimes they get married! and stay married! for a whole month! Of course, if New Age Girl’s comments about their wedding night are to be taken seriously (Dallas Sean: “There were fireworks!” New Age Girl: “Quick fireworks.” Chris Harrison: “~nervous laughter~”) there might not be much long-term hope for these two.Other things I learn from this complete waste of my time:OK, you two please to go away now, I do not want to think about your disappointing sex life ever again.And then there is some terrible Muppets synergy and NO. NO, ABC/DISNEY. I DIDN’T LIKE IT WHEN YOU DID IT ON THE BACHELORETTE AND I CERTAINLY DO NOT LIKE IT HERE. STOP IT. LEAVE. PIGGY. ALONE.Now for what we all came for: Mujeres, telling “all.” The women who were deemed memorable enough to be invited back include: CrazyEyes, Kylie, Nurse Ratched, Elise, Allison, Jacqueline Bisset, Chantal, Angry Kate McKinnon Character, Lauren S, Dirty Feet, Paula Abdul, Chelsie, Kat, Cesar Millan and Molly, Maria Callas, Momma and Abbie Carmichael. Somehow this is not all 25 women who have been eliminated (either by Juan Pablo or of their own conviction), although it seems impossible.Chris Harrison begins by reminding the women that at one point they liked Juan Pablo. Remember that? When you wanted him to propose to you? The ladies all agree that yes, at the beginning they were attracted to him. Come on! He plays soccer! He has a face! He has that often unintelligible accent that disguises the deeply offensive things he’s actually saying!Chris Harrison then wonders if Juan Pablo is so attractive, why wasn’t that enough? Abbie Carmichael has to explain to Chris Harrison likes he’s a fifth grader that a pretty face isn’t everything. Nurse Ratched adds that over the course of several weeks, she came to realize that their conversations weren’t going anywhere, and one of the Laurens, the one who wasn’t eliminated the first night after smearing massage oil all over Juan Pablo’s suit, offers that the only thing Juan Pablo ever asked them was, “What do you want to know about me?”AHAHAHAHAHAHA, of course he did.Chris Harrison notes that Momma seemed to have a different relationship with Juan Pablo, why was that? Well, Captain Obvious, maybe it had something to do with the fact that they were both parents, a point that was relentlessly harped on in every episode. But Paula Abdul, who also has a child, notes that he never asked her any questions about herself like, “what do you like on your pizza?” or “what’s your favorite color?” You know, the sort of deeper personal things you should know about someone before you marry them. Alli adds that on one date he asked her where she saw herself in five years, only to then ask her on a subsequent date where she saw herself in three years.AHAHAHAHAHAHA, of course he did!But that’s when Abbie Carmichael, of all people, steps in to defend Juan Pablo for being a narcissistic jerkhole. In the end, she thinks that Juan Pablo’s motivation to be on the show was different from theirs: they all came looking for a husband, but maybe he only wants a girlfriend. A girlfriend who is only interested in listening to stories about Juan Pablo, and whose favorite pizza toppings are to remain a mystery for the ages.The women then move onto their other issues with Juan Pablo, notably that he kept changing the rules on him. Cesar Millan notes — accurately — that Juan Pablo was all about making out with the ladies, except when he wasn’t, in which case he’d whip out the daughter card. Chris Harrison tries to defend Juan Pablo by claiming that parents in relationships have different priorities than non-parents, but that’s nonsense, and he knows it.Kat pipes up that she was irritated by how Juan Pablo constantly referred to Momma and Paula Abdul as his “las especiales,” which, fair enough! Paula Abdul adds to this that she gets why she and Momma were “especial,” but what she doesn’t get is why he treated the two of them differently from one another: why was he all about getting down with her, but telling Momma he wanted to wait? One of Las Especiales were being disrespected, but she’s not sure which of them it was. PALABRA, GIRL. And Cesar Millan, who is getting more and more worked up by the momento is all, “HE’S A LYING LIAR IS WHAT HE IS.”Chris Harrison changes the topic again: how about that time he and Niña de Papá went “swimming?” The mujeres, who had no idea it even happened at the time, remark that they found Juan Pablo taking Niña de Papá to his hot tub during their group date FAR more disrespectful than Niña de Papá luring him out into the ocean. Todos de las mujeres then jump to the defense of Niña de Papá’s honor: how DARE he slut shame her! HE’S the slutty one! SHAME ON HIM.Well then!Chris Harrison invites Maria Callas to the couch first, explaining that all his time trapped in this hellhole, he’s never seen a relationship quite like Maria Callas’ with Juan Pablo. But instead of explaining that this is because there has never been such a dramatic IQ discrepancy on this show before, the two talk in broad metaphors about roller coasters and things being black and white and how this show isn’t “real life.” Chris Harrison attempts to lure Maria Callas into calling Juan Pablo stupid, reminding her that she was the one who said the cerebral connection was missing and that she wished that she was “dumber.” But Maria Callas never quite arrives there because she has manners and class. In fact, Maria Callas goes out of her way to defend Juan Pablo, assuring the skeptics amongst us that Juan Pablo was “curious” and that their conversation wasn’t “non-existent,” which is almost positive!Of course, this applies to Abbie Carmichael, Esq., too.(This is when the 9-year-old wanders into the room, sees Maria Callas sitting on a couch talking about her “physical connection” with Juan Pablo, and announces that he thought The Bachelor was “a bunch of women jumping off cliffs and kissing.” You’re not wrong son, you’re not wrong.)Momma is next on Chris Harrison’s probing couch, and we learn absolutely nothing of interest about Juan Pablo. She had a connection with Juan Pablo because they are both parents (YES, WE KNOW.); She doesn’t regret not telling him that she loved him (GOOD, SHE SHOULDN’T.); She was a little irritated to see him kiss Niña de Papá 20 seconds after practically having to beg him to kiss her (AS SHE SHOULD BE). The only thing of interest that we learn in this interview is that Momma is in a new relationship that she is reluctant to discuss lest she jinx it. (Actually, she’s engaged! Mazel, Momma! Best wishes to both you and Ben!)Next up is Abbie Carmichael, Esq. who refused to play along and pretend that she was IN LURRRVE with Juan Pablo after the Fantasy Suite, instead choosing to call him a insensitive egomaniac to his face before dumping him.Abbie Carmichael explains that when they were first left alone in the Fantasy Suite, it was fine! They talked, they laughed a little, it was a relief to be alone and away from the cameras. But then, all Juan Pablo wanted to talk about was Juan Pablo: soccer and traveling and who he knows. Abbie Carmichael, who if she hasn’t already been chosen to be the next Bachelorette is certainly not discouraging the idea, then makes a shrewd move and claims that Juan Pablo was being “negative” about the whole process and not grateful for the opportunity he was given — implying, of course, that she has nothing but respect for the process of dating 25 people at once, and, if she were given the opportunity, she would only be positive about it, always. Well played, madam.Abbie Carmichael then explains that she thinks Juan Pablo thinks he’s a great Bachelor and the crowd laughs. THIS IS HOW FAR YOU HAVE FALLEN, CHAMO: YOU’VE LOST THE “WOMEN TELL ALL” AUDIENCE.Abbie Carmichael adds that Juan Pablo also made some disturbing comments about how she was barely still in the competition, and then had the gall to mention his overnight with Niña de Papá, who does that? That was the moment when Abbie Carmichael was done with Juan Pablo, and, really, who can blame her? And so she pretended to be asleep and willed dawn to arrive so that she could get away from this huevón.Abbie Carmichael notes that while he was rude and inappropriate and made her feel cheap, she recognizes he didn’t intend to do so — he just doesn’t have a filter or any understanding of how words work. But what really chaps her hide is that when confronted with his rudeness, Juan Pablo defends himself by claiming he was just being honest, and “is okay.” NO IS OKAY,  MARICO.Chris Harrison asks Abbie Carmichael how she’s holding up, and she assures him that she still believes that true love exists and that she will continue to search for it. In fact, she’d be willing to take this “journey” all over again, if Chris Harrison knows what she means.Finally, it is Juan Pablo’s turn to come out and defend himself against these raving maenads. Chris Harrison begins by asking Juan Pablo that now, having had a chance to watch himself over the course of the season, does he have any regrets? “NOPE!” Juan Pablo insists, “I’ve been honest from day uno! Sometimes I am rude, yes, but I do not care! It is unimportant to me, your feelings, ¿comprendes?”The first woman to confront Juan Pablo is the one who got drunk and tried to kiss him, but he wouldn’t kiss her because he had completely forgotten she was even on the show, but then claimed that the actual reason he isn’t kissing her was because Camila. And she’s like, “So, yeah, what was up with that, dude? If you weren’t into me, that’s cool, but you didn’t need to drag your daughter into it — especially when it didn’t stop you from making out with 17 other ladies.” But instead of answering that perfectly reasonable question (although really it was more of a point), Juan Pablo insists that he isn’t letting Camila watch the show. IS OKAY. Well that’s good? I guess? But that was not the pregunta?Chris Harrison points out that while Juan Pablo was reluctant to kiss Momma, he was all over Niña de Papá, and Juan Pablo is all, “¿Uh, sí? ¡Por supuesto!” Juan Pablo then explains that Momma had told him a story about how her son was devastated by a breakup with her ex-boyfriend, and it made Juan Pablo realize that it he needed to be careful with Momma and her son and take his time.At this, Paula Abdul challenges Juan Pablo’s decision to have a hometown visit with Momma and his choice to meet Ben. If Juan Pablo knew Momma wasn’t going to make it to the end — and let’s be honest, he knew she wasn’t going to make it to the end — why would he meet her child? Pero Juan Pablo, he no comprende — why, he introduces first dates to his hija all the time. What’s the gran deal? IS OKAY!I mean, other than leading an endless parade of women through your daughter’s life, and not giving her an example of a strong stable relationship and establishing the idea that no one ever sticks around in the end, I guess you’ve got a point there, Juan Pablo! I hadn’t thought of it that way!Chantal would like to take exception to the very fact that Juan Pablo set Momma and Paula Abdul aside as Las Especiales in the first place, after all, they all had lives they left behind to be on the show. Juan Pablo argues (not incorrectly) that children are different from jobs or dogs or whatever, that these women left sons behind. Juan Pablo then ruins his argument by unnecessarily adding that it was different for him when he was on The Bachelorette, because Camila had her mother to take care of her. 1. No one was calling you a hypocrite for being on The Bachelorette, but 2. Don’t Momma’s and Paula Abdul’s sons have fathers and grandparents in their lives, so really, it’s not all that different from Camila being with her mother?CrazyEyes insists that leaving one’s massage table and reflexology charts behind and leaving one’s son behind IS the same thing, WHY WON’T HE ACKNOWLEDGE IT, and Juan Pablo sighs that he knows, he knows, he has compassion, there were just a lot of people he had to get to know and remember, what is her name again?But the ladies, they are RILLY RILLY MAD about this whole Las Especiales thing, and Alli demands that he quit saying that he was “honest” and “fair” when he was playing favorites. And look, while I like a good pile-on as much as the next person, don’t any of these women realize that Las Especiales aren’t in the final two and that the only “special” treatment that they ultimately received was that one was kept at arm’s length for the majority of the proceedings and the other was sent packing on her birthday?So Abbie Carmichael steps in to be the voice of reason, again, and points out that what he meant by “Las Especiales” is that they had to be treated with more care and sent home the moment he knew his relationship with them wasn’t going anywhere. WHICH HE DID. Abbie Carmichael then turns to Juan Pablo and assures him that just because she defended him doesn’t mean he’s not a jerk — he’s totally a jerk — but he’s not a jerk because of Momma and Paula Abdul. “IS OKAY,” Juan Pablo chirps.Abbie Carmichael then notes that one of the things that did bother her was the fact that while they all came here looking for a husband, Juan Pablo seldom used the word “wife.” Nor did he really take the time to get to know them as people, or to learn anything of substance about any of them. “IS OKAY,” Juan Pablo responds.Juan Pablo goes on to answer that this is just Abbie Carmichael’s opinion — he learned everything he needed to about them: 1. How well his tongue fit in their mouths and 2. How good they were at listening to stories about Juan Pablo. What else did he need to know? IS OKAY!Chris Harrison drags Maria Callas into the fray, who says that while she felt he took her seriously, she is hearing that the other ladies didn’t have a similar experience. Whaddya gonna do? At this, Dirty Feet wails that the 27 of them just wanted to each have personal relationships with him, to connect with him in a true and meaningful and special way, IS THAT SO MUCH TOO ASK?And then Cesar Millan, who has been uncharacteristically quiet up through the Juan Pablo portion of the evening, announces that she has something to say: “As someone who has a gay parent, I’d love if you’d explain the comment ‘The gays are more pervert?’ What was that all about, mojón?” Juan Pablo insists, “IS OKAY,” before apologizing for the comment and offering to discuss it after the show, it was taken out of context. “Alright then,” Kelly fires back, “tell me how ‘pervert’ is out of context. Use your Español.”It’s at this point Jacqueline Bisset interjects that as someone who speaks English as a second language herself, she’d appreciate it if Juan Pablo would quit using his language issues as a cop-out for just being rude. Chris Harrison, realizing that these ladies are ready to tear Juan Pablo limb-from-limb, intervenes, and allows Juan Pablo to address the gay pervert issue without interruption.Except he does not. Instead, he says he’d rather not waste 4 minutes talking about it here, but rather an hour explaining everything to Cesar Millan privately. He’s not un homophobe! He has gay amigos! Gay amigos who called him after that story came out! He knows gay people were born that way! And you should maybe feel very badly for Juan Pablo because people are still mad at him from that one time he said the horrible thing about an entire group of people being perverts! Maria Callas comes swooping in on his defense, claiming that it wasn’t shown on their date, but this one time they talked about equality issues, and he was totally for it, you guys. Really. No, she’s serious.And with that, Chris Harrison introduces the blooper reel. Longtime readers know that the one depth to which I shall not plunge is “blooper reels,” and so this will go uncommented except to say that in one clip Juan Pablo keeps referring to himself and his “leetle package,” thereby confirming what I suspected really happened in Abbie Carmichael’s Fantasy Suite.Finally, we are given a preview of the finale which looks like it will be two solid hours of Nurse Nikki and Niña de Papá rolling around on their hotel beds, crying. Who will he choose — or will he choose anyone? Honestly, the best possible outcome would be that Juan Pablo pulls a Wombat and chooses no one, and these women can go back to their lives knowing they dodged one egomaniacal, small-packaged bullet.The Bachelor airs on Mondays at 7 p.m. on ABC.Therese is also watching Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Saturday Night Live, The Walking Dead, The Olympics and Arrested Development kinda, sorta, so go easy on her if these entries are un poco late.Note: This is a seattlepi.com reader blog.

537	"Find out exactly why ABC won't cast anoverweight 'Bachelor' -- and why they need to!Chris Harrison, host of The Bachelor on ABC, is speaking out on why most of the bachelors are, well, all the same: straight and hot.When asked why there has never been a gay bachelor, Harrison didn't pull a Juan Pablo Galavis and deliver a homophobic remark veiled under an ""But English is my second language!"" excuse. Instead, Harrison was blunt: It's all about the business!""The question is: Is it a good business decision?"" told The New York Times Magazine. ""I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model, and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell.""But beefcakes do. And that's also why Harrison, though iffy on a homosexual bachelor series, is firmly against a chubby, overweight or obese bachelor.""No. You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say,"" he said. But don't think Harrison thinks he's above it, either. He agrees he'd never be a Bachelor himself!""I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive,"" Harrison said. ""Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites.""But he probably likes eating pizza, and he doesn't seem like a complete douchebag, which would be an improvement on the prior Bachelors: Remeber Jake Pavelka, who was super mean to Vienna Girardi when the cameras were off? Or how Galavis boasted to Andi Dorfman about the other women he'd spent the night with already? Or the creepy way Sean Lowe talks about his new sex life with Catherine Guidici?Maybe a less self-absorbed, vain dude would treat his women better. When it's a choice between respect, devotion and adoration and a few extra pounds, I'll take a little paunch any day. If a man who loves pizza and hamburgers treats you better than a guy with highlights, a fake tan and abs of steel who gorges on grilled chicken and stares at his reflection more than your eyes, go with your gut ... for the guy with a gut. More from YourTango:© 2017 by Tango Media Corporation All Rights Reserved."

Remember “free spirit” Lucy Aragon, the “Bachelor” contestant who couldn’t keep her clothes on? (But really, how could you forget?) Since her brief stint on the show, she’s managed to move on to Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel and venture out into the music world.Remember “free spirit” Lucy Aragon, the “Bachelor” contestant who couldn’t keep her clothes on? (But really, how could you forget?) Since her brief stint on the show, she’s managed to move on to Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel and venture out into the music world. With only a ukulele covering her goods, Aragon posted a video Monday of her original song “Ess Okay” to YouTube for our enjoyment. “Juan Pablo, you kicked us off of your show. We’re doing so fine, we’re drinking red wine all night,” she sings. “You sent my a-- home cuz’ I was always in the nude, you ain’t ready for this jelly cuz’ you’re kind of a prude.” Aragon debuted the song on Instagram with this caption: ""The moment has finally arrived! I give you...the Bachelor Reject Anthem. Original music and lyrics by the only and only #freespirit ME. I just want to show the world that you can make fun of somebody and still be funny rather than mean.”We’d tell her not to quit her day job, but we’re still trying to figure out what, exactly, that is.Warning: Some of Aragon's lyrics are NSFW.

For Cailyn Cox, writing isn't just a hobby, it's her life. Passionate about Hollywood, she makes it her mission to find the most entertaining celebrity gossip for SheKnows readers. And when she's not enthralled in the celeb world, she's ...Chris Harrison has seen a lot of Bachelors come and go because of his job as the host of ABC's hit series The Bachelor.The question on everyone's mind at the moment is whether or not there could be the possibility of a homosexual Bachelor on the show in the near future.The current leading man, Juan Pablo Galavis, has already caused an uproar on that topic after he said homosexuals are ""more 'pervert' in a sense. And to me the show would be too strong... too hard to watch.""Although the Venezuelan star has since backtracked and explained that his comments were the result of a language barrier, the same pressing question is not going away any time soon, and this time, Harrison is in the firing line.However, the 42-year-old TV host was far more diplomatic in his answer, and during his interview with The New York Times Magazine, he confessed he was hesitant about whether there should be a gay Bachelor.Harrison told the publication, ""The question is: Is it a good business decision?""""I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this — Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell.""And although the dating show host may be on the fence about having a gay star on The Bachelor, he definitely is against having a chubby one. When asked if the show would consider a heavier star, Harrison said, ""No. You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say, but I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive.""""Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites.""And when asked if Harrison himself would ever like to be a star on The Bachelor, he replied, ""Now that I'm divorced, it's feasible.""""But there needs to be a level of innocence and naïveté when you come in to be the Bachelor, and I have none. I have seen how the sausage has been made for 12 years now, and I helped make that sausage and so it just wouldn't work.""SheKnows Media &dash; EntertainmentThe stuff you need to know, crafted just for you.

From Andi's follow-up of last episode's ending to Kelly's emotional reaction to Juan Pablo's off-camera remarks and a bunch of stuff in between, Juan Pablo certainly took his fair share of heat.  But it was also surprising who came to his defense, especially when it came to the almost unanimous claim that all his conversations were superficial.
The Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Andi would make a fantastic Bachelorette
""I think Andi, Sharleen and Renee had a good point and defended him because they did have a relationship with him,"" host Chris Harrison tells TVGuide.com. ""I hate to say this to the other girls, but he just didn't want to have a relationship with them. There's no nice way to say that.""
Keep reading for more of Harrison's take on the episode and what he has to say about next week's big finale. Plus: Should Juan Pablo choose Nikki or Clare? Don't forget to vote in our poll.  
It was great to see Sean and Catherine. Does it make it more fun when you have a success story?Chris Harrison: They were in my dressing room before the show, and we were hanging out, talking about the honeymoon and about real-life stuff. They're just a normal couple so ridiculously in love. It's validating, but more just cool to see these kids in love.

But it was also surprising who came to his defense, especially when it came to the almost unanimous claim that all his conversations were superficial.The Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Andi would make a fantastic Bachelorette""I think Andi, Sharleen and Renee had a good point and defended him because they did have a relationship with him,"" host Chris Harrison tells TVGuide.com. ""I hate to say this to the other girls, but he just didn't want to have a relationship with them. There's no nice way to say that.""Keep reading for more of Harrison's take on the episode and what he has to say about next week's big finale. Plus: Should Juan Pablo choose Nikki or Clare?

Does it make it more fun when you have a success story?Chris Harrison: They were in my dressing room before the show, and we were hanging out, talking about the honeymoon and about real-life stuff. They're just a normal couple so ridiculously in love.

Harrison has seen it all during his time as host of the reality competition, and this season is definitely no different.""No,"" Harrison responded to a question posed by the New York Times Magazine about having a ""less hunky, like maybe a chubby guy"" for a Bachelor.""You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say, but I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive. Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites,"" Harrison explained.When asked about having a gay Bachelor on the show, Harrison was a little hesitant and said it would depend on whether it would be good for business.""I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model, and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell,"" Harrison said.Of course, much has been made about the possibility of having a gay Bachelor after the current Bachelor, Juan Pablo, made a controversial remark and said that a gay Bachelor would not be a ""good example"" because gay people are ""more pervert.""

This year it's different.""It's definitely changed,"" said Cannon, a vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz here. ""I'm hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It's just, 'Sally, the engineer.'""As startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female-focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what traditionally has been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.The shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.Started in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year's main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named ""breakout app"" in 2011.This year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Ore.-based Palo Alto Software, was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry's culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as ""brogrammers.""""Part of that is the 'bro-gramming' and too-cool-for-school attitude that goes on,"" she said in an interview before her meeting. ""What women have to push really hard about is you don't have to be successful in a man's world - it's just the world.""Parsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference's panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.Hugh Forrest, the symposium's director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.""If I had a dime for everybody who said that's a great rule but there just aren't enough qualified women I'd be rich, rich, rich,"" he said. ""My reaction is: Look a little bit harder.

547	"After last year’s takeover of South By Southwest (SXSW) by Justin Timberlake and Prince you could hear the collective groan across the social media when Apple announced its plan to bring its iTunes Festival to SXSW this year.Now entering its 28th year, SXSW is without a doubt the premiere festival for the music industry. Once a regional outpost for in-state acts and musical hopefuls, SXSW is now listed amongst the “50 Most Innovative Companies” by Fast Company. Looked to by corporate marketers aiming to build brand cachet with tastemakers, the festival hosted 2,278 bands across five nights in 2013, most paying to play what the company deems “one of the biggest global music market places in the world”.With more than 76,000 people attending SXSW, one would think an audience for new musicals acts would be easy to find. Yet the math dictates otherwise. With hundreds of bands performing each night – most of which are relegated to playing upstart showcases – the audience wanes when badge holders clamor for the chance to see big name acts – often after standing in line for hours – thus negating chances for bands in their early stages to be seen and discovered. With the world’s largest brand touting the chance to see radio-friendly acts like Coldplay, Pitbull and Imagine Dragons through a lottery system this year, the naysayers have every right to scream “sell out”.SXSW is still credited as a launching pad for upcoming acts: the critical reception of Waxahatchee’s Cerulean Salt was no doubt impacted by the band’s attendance last year. Savages signed a deal with Matador during or shortly after the festival. But what about the thousands of other acts who’ve made the trek on their own dime to Austin for a shot at recognition? How can they compete with the likes of Cee-Lo Green and Blondie, who are scheduled to play Rachel Ray’s annual party? It’s not like the brands that pay to sponsor stages and provide free samples to attendees are there to support struggling musical artists when throngs of people angle to say they were lucky enough to see these mainstream artists.Sure, performances by iTunes Festival acts can be streamed live or on-demand, viewed with the iTunes Festival app or via Apple TV by those who can’t afford the hundreds of dollars required to obtain a festival badge. But does an Internet connection provide the same experience as being there? For musicians and fans alike, there is a no-cost counterpoint to SXSW one can enjoy at their leisure.Entering its fourth year, the social media-based festival dubbed Couch By Couchwest (CXCW) runs concurrently with SXSW. Billing itself as a festival “where the beer is cheaper and the only hipster is you”, the idea of CXCW was hatched and promoted by four music bloggers in 2011. Like SXSW, the nascent festival does not lack for star power: CXCW has hosted performers including Neko Case and Rhett Miller. Add to that roster a number of critically acclaimed artists such as Wooden Wand, Glossary, Austin Lucas, Doc Feldman and John Moreland, and you have the opportunity to see independent acts who travel sparingly or on regional paths. The hook: Couch By Couchwest is a YouTube festival where artists who either eschew the corporate nature of SXSW, can’t afford to go to Austin or those who have never ventured out beyond their homes to perform in front of an audience of their peers are invited to record themselves performing a song exclusive to the festival. Performances have been done in living rooms, kitchens, thrift shops, the New York City subway, you name it, as long as it’s not a stage. The videos are then aired during the week’s festivities and promoted via Twitter and Facebook. As with SXSW, there are sponsors of the festival, ranging from an artisanal mustard company to independent music labels whose artists perform at the festival. Prizes are given for contests that include best poster, haikus about the festival and recipes for Taco Tuesdays and Doritoballs. To learn more about the origins, history and potential legacy of CXCW, I interviewed one of the festival’s founders, Amy Holdorf, who ran the music blog, My Aimz Is True.* * *Why did you start CXCW? Was it out of abject disdain for SXSW?We have nothing but love for SXSW! It started in 2011 when a bunch of our friends were bragging on Twitter about how they were going to SXSW, and we were insanely jealous. We couldn’t go to Austin due to lack of funds, family obligations, career commitments, etc. We thought, “Where’s the SXSW for those of us stuck at home on the couch?” Thus, Couch by Couchwest was born. We made a Twitter account, a crappy Tumblr blog, a G-mail account, talked to a few musicians that we knew, chatted ourselves up on Twitter, and the rest is history. How many submissions did you receive the first year?The first year we had 75 unique artists and posted 212 different entries. Several artists made more than one video. Some PR person in Boston picked us up too, so we got a ton of submissions from the Boston area. We also posted photos of people “enjoying” CXCW. We want the festival to be interactive, so we encourage non-musicians to send us photos of them with their laptops or tablets, watching videos. People also send us photos of their cats and dogs sacked out on the couch. Unlike SXSW, animals and children are welcome at CXCW!How many did you expect the first year?I don’t think we expected anything the first year. Sweet-talking artists like Neko Case and Cory Branan into doing it was dumb luck. How has CXCW grown year over year?2011 (Tumblr blog) – 75 artists/bands, 99 videos, 92 other posts. 2012 (moved to couchbycouchwest.com) - 228 artists/bands, 242 videos, 64 other posts (we got overwhelmed and started combining multiple photos or videos into one blog post). 2013 – 348 artists/bands, 371 videos, 45 other postsCan you highlight any acts that have benefitted from CXCW?I have no idea if any acts have benefitted from CXCW. One cool thing that we did notice that would not have happened if not for CXCW: in 2012 both The Dead Exs of New York City and the venerable Ray Wiley Hubbard of Texas submitted videos and saw each other’s videos. Hubbard invited them to Texas to tour with him. How cool is that? A band called Mandolin Orange got a lot of press a few months after their CXCW 2012 video. They were featured on NPR and a few other national media outlets. I like to think that we had something to do with their success, but probably not. I know that we and others have made a lot of great friends and met a lot of amazing people though this little festival. That alone is worth all of the work we put into it.How much work is involved in curating CXCW?It’s a stupid amount of work. We all have day jobs, families, and other life commitments on top of trying to pull this festival off. We don’t get a lot of sleep during CXCW week. We were completely overwhelmed by the number of videos sent to us in 2013, so we brought in two more people to help us curate this year. We also tried to streamline the submission process a bit. If we had money, we would hire a programmer to help us automate some of the curating. In fact, in true slacker form, we put all of the work for CXCW 2014 off until the last minute and we will be scrambling to get everything together this year. I’m not proud of this, but such is life. That’s why I'm answering questions for PopMatters at 12:34AM on a Friday night a week before CXCW.Are labels involved and supportive?The indie labels we have approached or that we know people at have been awesome. They give us albums to give away, and encourage their artists to make videos. Yer Bird, an indie label in Calgary, Canada, has been with us from the start. This Is American Music tells all of their bands to make videos for us. Plus, they have given us CDs to give away. Last Chance Records has also given us stuff to give away and told their artists about it. We have approached other labels, but they have said they are too busy with SXSW.How long do you see CXCW continuing?CXCW will continue for as long as we remain interested in running the festival. I think we will always be interested in the music side of the event. Discovering new artists and bands is the best part of CXCW! I can see a point where we get tired of running the website and curating the videos. Then we will become corporate whores like SXSW, and sell CXCW out to iTunes and Doritos and Foursquare for millions and millions of dollars. Do you feel bands rely on CXCW?I seriously doubt bands rely on CXCW. If they do, they need a better PR plan. I would love it if we found someone new and made them famous, but I really don’t see that happening with our little festival. Does that even happen at SXSW anymore? This is really just for fun, and to give the artists a little more exposure.What do you feel the legacy, if any, of CXCW will be?Sofa sales skyrocket. Ikea becomes a major sponsor. Our fans successfully groove perfect butt spots into their couch cushions. All of the couch time plus the awesome tunes drives our festival goers to the Internet to buy tons and tons of music, which eventually not only saves the music industry, but also USPS (someone needs to deliver all of that vinyl). People around the world realize the benefit of chilling on the couch with a beer and some music. Dogs and cats start living together. World peace is achieved.Which social media outlet has the greatest impact on CXCW?Twitter, without question. We didn’t even have a Facebook page the first year. People who like the same things tend to find each other pretty easily on Twitter, and word of mouth (or tweet of mouth, or something) is a powerful way to publically spread the word about the festival. We do all of our announcements on Twitter and only cross post to Facebook maybe five percent of what we post on Twitter. This year our goal is to get CXCW trending. SXSW and their attendees are nauseatingly vocal on Twitter. We hope to carve out a slice of Twitter for ourselves this year. Do you have any CXCW personal highlights?Oh jeez, where to begin? Scoring Neko Case our first year was so killer. She was promoting a charity that she works with and we were happy to help her. Her video was so cute. Lee Bains III and the Glory Fires also did an amazing video in 2011. They were recently signed to Sub Pop, and about a month ago I saw them put on a blistering show here in Boston. They are one of my favorite bands right now. In 2012 Tyler Stetson from Oregon did a brilliant parody of James Taylor’s “Carolina in My Mind”, changing it to “SXSW in My Mind”. I laughed about it for weeks. And The Famous did an amazing cover of The Misfits’ “Hybrid Moments”. So, so good! In 2013 we started off the festival with a band from rural Utah called Two Mules Blues. They put on a good rock set, and then blew up a couch. One of the band members has a pyro license or something. When I first saw the video, I stood up and applauded. We had a bunch of extremely talented kids perform in 2013, too. Can’t do that at the bars in Austin! Eight-year-old Emi Sunshine (and her rooster Tom Cruise) blew us away. Burgeoning juvenile delinquents, three brothers known as The Foresters, also kicked some bum. A few artists play with their little kids in the videos, which is so sweet. Larry Hooper and his daughter Finley have been at every CXCW, including 2011 when Finley was four months old! I’m skipping so many good artists, but you can still see most of the videos on our YouTube playlists. I can’t wait to see what 2014 brings!* * *As an active participant in CXCW I can attest the festival does not rival SXSW in scope or influence, but the shared DIY attitude of its curators, fans and artists has made CXCW a genuine musical event with a sense of communal belonging and true discovery long since lost at SXSW. While some may view this grass-roots festival as a bit of a lark, were it not for CXCW I would not be familiar with or have traveled to see artists like Miss Shevaughn and Yuma Wray who debuted songs from their latest release, Lean Into the Wind at CXCW 2013.If you can't make it to Austin this year, pull up a couch cushion and enjoy CXCW 2014. They’ve saved a space for you. You may just enjoy yourself and discover your new favorite band you would otherwise not have been introduced to through any other musical festival. Best of all, no badge is required.Couch By Couchwest runs March 9-15, 2014.Janiva Magness unleashes her blues swagger on a new set of smokin' and thought-provoking soul/Americana tunes with new album Love Is an Army.While America was riveted by the ""Red Scare"" on the one hand, it failed to see what the other hand, the Nazi threat, was doing.Despite its conservative attitudes, The 15.17 to Paris is as radical in its way as Eastwood's more progressive films.  Americana artist Roger Street Friedman delivers a nostalgic western ballad set in Texas for the third song in his online residency with PopMatters. On her latest single ""Here We Go Again"", soulful singer-songwriter Jess Nolan laments the current state of the world in a call for unity. Synthwave and synthpop cross seamlessly together on second full-length from Virginia outfit, the Rain Within.

			Trending:		Michael and Lisa Gungor head up the Grammy-winning gospel group Gungor.Pseudo hip-hop band Wheelchair Sports Camp.Folk-rocker Lara Ruggles of Boulder.Margaret Hunt, director of Colorado Creative Industries, at Red Rocks. CCI is sending a large contingent to the SXSW event.Among the thousands of bands, bloggers, CEOs, celebrities and consumer brands heading to Austin, Texas, this week for the annual  South By Southwest Music Festival will be a couple of state government employees looking to drum up interest in Colorado’s music industry.One visit won’t turn Denver into the next Nashville, but Colorado Creative Industries’ chief Margaret Hunt and her colleague Christy Costello do hope to  pitch the potential of the state’s  already bustling music industry to musicians, record labels and recording studios, and, perhaps, attract another major national festival.They have success stories to tell — nationally known acts including The Lumineers, One Republic and The Fray hail from Colorado — and can tout major performance destinations, including Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the Telluride Bluegrass Festival.“Colorado Creative Industries‘ goal is to meet with industry leaders and explore what’s happening in music and the future of the music industry to help position Colorado in the forefront,” said Hunt, whose office is a division of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.Although her office spent $10,000 on the business-development venture, Hunt said Colorado’s  official foray into the SXSW marketing fray  doesn’t have specific goals attached.Hunt hopes to make impressions and identify industry trends. She’ll meet with the  Future of Music Coalition —  individuals involved in music production, distribution and sales, television and radio, music directors, composers and more.“I thought this would be a good opportunity to put our toe in the water,” Hunt  said.CCI also is co-sponsor, with the Colorado Tourism Office, of the  30-band   Colorado Music Party on Thursday and Friday. The unofficial showcase, also sponsored by   OpenAir,  Reverb and  SpokesBuzz,   will feature such local bands as You Me & Apollo, Rose Quartz, Gungor and Wheelchair Sports Camp.While CCI supports  a wide spectrum of creative industries — fine arts, dance,  writing, publishing and more — Hunt sees music as a key area to develop.“You look at music festivals and events, the number of venues, the number of recording artists —  and Colorado is up there with the cities known for music, like Seattle and Austin,” Hunt said.SXSW, which runs through Sunday, is considered the premier music industry showcase and  festival in the country. The event draws more than 25,000 official participants, including bands and industry professionals.“We’re approaching this as an industry team to market and brand Colorado,” Hunt  said.CCI, which has an annual budget of $2.7 million, provides grants to arts and cultural organizations and public art programs, funds  the Creative District Program, and supports artists and creative entrepreneurs through the Denver Music Summit,  youth arts education, and public school programs.Major players in  Colorado’s music industry see the SXSW investment as an important  gesture of support.“It sends the message that the state is more and more committed to helping this place become even more of a mecca for music,” AEG Live Rocky Mountains CEO Chuck Morris said. “The more people that want to move here, the more studios that open up, the more interest from musicians and songwriters is a great thing for our state, our economy and music community.”You Me & Apollo vocalist Brent Cowles said state backing of the Colorado Music Party means a lot to him and his indie-rock band.“There’s a lot of music coming out of Colorado that’s getting attention,” he said, “and this  means (the state is) going to invest in it and believe in it.”Kendall Smith,  from The Denver Post’s Underground Music Showcase, and Dani Grant, who runs the Fort Collins  band incubator SpokesBuzz, approached Hunt to get the state involved in music efforts at SXSW.“They recognized that Colorado Creative Industries and the state had a role to play in advancing the music industry,” Hunt said.As the Colorado contingent hits Austin this week, it will be among the likes of Doritos, Converse, Spotify, iTunes and countless other brands trying to be heard in the marketing scrum — a challenge for any brand  pushing its   product  at SXSW.“There’s no question that SXSW is  loud,” said  Elaine Garza, an Austin-based marketing and PR expert who has worked with brands at SXSW for 15 years.“There’s so much going on and there’s always the question: Is it worth the investment to come?”Garza said she knew of no other state being represented at SXSW, and since  Colorado isn’t pitching a consumer brand, like an energy drink or jeans, the message might resonate with fans and industry pros.“It kind of makes a bigger statement that Colorado is investing in the music scene and spending money to promote that,” she said.Matt Miller: 303-954-1785, mrmiller@denverpost.com or twitter.com/official_mattm"	Entertainment
550	"A record number of Australian bands and artists will join some of the world's best at the South by Southwest music conference in Austin, Texas, from today.Fifty-five Australian bands, solo artists and producers will showcase their talents to representatives from global music markets over the five-day event, which runs from March 11 to 16.“Events like SXSW provide a good springboard for artists,” said Millie Millgate of Sounds Australia, a joint initiative of the Australia Council and APRA|AMCOS that has promoted local music to export markets since 2009.“The name of the game at SXSW is to get seen and to be heard,” Ms Millgate said, adding that Sounds Australia manages showcases for musicians at the event.This year's record attendance by local artists owes to a surge in up-and-coming dance and electro acts, following the breakout success of Flume, Flight Facilities and Gold Fields at previous SXSWs.Of the 55 Australian artists, 21 are dance and/or electro acts.Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's

            Australia's electro scene has boomed so much that last year's flagship, the Aussie BBQ, expands this year to include a night dedicated to the dancefloor. ""Beat Pie"" caters to the demand for Australian electro, dance and hip-hop acts.For relatively new Brisbane indie electro producer Danny Harley, who plays under the moniker the Kite String Tangle, SXSW will be his first gig overseas. He says the chance owes to the breakthrough success of his electro hit Given the Chance. The track has amassed almost 900,000 Soundcloud plays since its release in August and charted at No. 19 in Triple J's Hottest 100 – a solid achievement given Harley is yet to release an EP or album.“The success of my current track is largely due to international blogs,” Harley said, adding that “the online buzz was really valuable for spreading the word about my song. But it will be interesting to see if any of that word has actually made it [to SXSW]”.More than 1700 acts will play at SXSW, but thousands more promoters, managers and labels will lurk behind the scenes, looking out for the next big thing.“For the most part the acts with the most buzz heading in to the conference are the ones that are most likely to come away from it with success,” Ms Millgate said, pointing to the importance of social media and blogs in building a successful SXSW campaign.It wasn't always like this.Brisbane indie rocker John Patterson, guitarist for the Grates, described their first trip to SXSW at the start of their career in 2005 as “a bit of a gamble”.At the time, the three-piece had just signed on to their record label in Australia following a handful of homemade EPs and grassroots shows, and going overseas was a financial risk.“SXSW is such a huge event,"" Patterson says. ""There are so many opportunities for things to get seen and things to get missed . . . you're competing with thousands of other bands.""But their wager paid off, and through their first SXSW appearance the group landed a US record deal. They have since returned twice, in 2006 and 2009, to promote new material.The sentiment is shared by fellow Brisbane indie four-piece the Jungle Giants, who are making their SXSW debut.While they have gained renown at home after touring with the Big Day Out, Splendour in the Grass and the Falls Festival, they're cutting their teeth overseas.“It's only now become financially feasible to head over to America, so it's all culminated to this point,"" frontman Sam Hales said.As an unsigned band he hopes the Jungle Giants will meet international labels and garner the release of their debut album, Learn to Exist, overseas, as well as an American tour.Even established Australian bands are jumping on the opportunities of SXSW.ARIA chart toppers Boy and Bear will head to the conference for their second time, and as drummer Tim Hart said, it's almost like starting again with their new album Harlequin Dream.“It's a really interesting thing over there,"" Hart said. ""You're just another band because there are so many other artists. But this is where all the promoters, festival owners and everyone go to and they're looking for acts.""As a more experienced and mature band, Boy and Bear are ready to make the most out of the SXSW experience, Hart said, and look forward to the networking opportunities.Save articles for later.Subscribe for unlimited access to news.

Angel OlsenThe Missouri-born singer’s simple chords and powerful yet intimate vocals tell you it’s ok to be lonely. Who needs more than thoughtful songs combined with grunge guitar? Her latest album Burn Your Fire For No Witness is out now on Jagjaguwar.Jamestown RevivalJamestown Revival is essentially Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance, two guys from a little town called Magnolia, Texas who have been singing together since they were kids. They have a fresh take on classic twang and their harmonies are as tight as any Everly Brothers recording.NoThis L.A.-based rock band draws comparisons to The National thanks to the deep baritone of Bradley Hanan Carter and lyrics like “We make some noise inside a room and call it art” on their dramatic new single “Leave the Door Wide Open.”The PreaturesHailing from Sydney, Australia the band’s latest album Is This How You Feel? is out now on Harvest Records. Isabella Manfredi and Gideon Benson trade off vocal duties over a beat of rhythm-focused ’70s pop.JettaAs a backup singer Jetta has been on the road with Paloma Faith and Cee Lo Green. Now, we get to hear her commanding voice as she steps forward to perform her own songs. “Feels Like Coming Home” is the powerful single on her debut EP Start A Riot, out now on Universal Republic Records.Cloud NothingsThe first single from their next album (due in April), “I’m Not Part of Me” strikes a balance between noisy pop punk and hummable hooks.Nikki LaneThe country singer’s sophomore album (out May 6), produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, is an eagerly anticipated way for the sweet and sour singer to croon that it’s “always the right time to do the wrong thing.”Future IslandsThere’s been a lot of buzz for the combo of cool synth pop and Samuel T. Herring’s dramatic vocals. Along with a Coachella appearance and a number of sold out headlining dates, the band played The Late Show and will release its new album Singles on March 25.The Autumn DefenseSince 1999, this has been a side-project for John Stirratt, the bass player in Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, as he collaborates with multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone on ’60s rock and pop. Their fifth LP, cleverly called Fifth, was released this past January on Yep Roc.Speedy OrtizThis Massachusetts band, led by Sadie Dupuis, brings ‘90s-style lo-fi guitar and Liz Phair-esque vocals in to the 21st century. The quartet is preparing for the release of a full-length album this year. Just because we love the name: Potty MouthAnd a few Los Angeles-based acts we’d like to get to: Avi Buffalo, The Blank Tapes, Eleni Mandell, Kelela, Dum Dum Girls, Holly Conlan, Banks, and Fever the Ghost.Tags: Angel Olsen, Cloud Nothings, Future Islands, Jamestown Revival, Jetta, L.A.

dean@coloradodaily.comdean@coloradodaily.com I'm sorry. It's that time of year. I'm going to write about South by Southwest.This will be my third year attending and covering the festival, and I apologize because I've grown a sense of guilt about it. Mocking SXSW is about as common and easy as mocking Coachella or Miley Cyrus. The other thing those three have in common, though, is that they're actually fun if you can manage to not be an eye-rolling, better-than-thou contrarian.Look, I'm not clueless and neither are most people who go to Austin in March. The festival isn't what it used to be, it's too corporate, it's over-hyped, it's not the real Austin, etc. They're valid issues, but there are valid reasons not to do a lot of fun things. If you have the press pass and/or the financial means, why not? And if you don't, why not pay attention, even peripherally?SXSW's music festival is still a great place to find bands. Last year, I caught shows from the Whiskey Shivers and Ringo Deathstarr. In the year since, I brought them both into Second Story Garage. Oddly enough, the first time I ever saw some Colorado bands was at SXSW two years ago. Just following the coverage might give you a handful of new bands to check out.Austin is weird, as any souvenir T-shirt will tell you, and SXSW acts as an amplifier. The weirdness isn't even coming from locals half the time, for the month of March. Maybe you have to be of a certain age or disposition to enjoy wading through a litter-strewn and crowded Sixth Street, enjoying dancing sousaphone players or dancing skeleton marionettes. That's cool. Enjoy it emanating from your computer screen instead. This sounds like a pitch, and I guess in a way it is, but mostly it's an argument in favor of chilling out and enjoying something. Maybe SXSW has a confused purpose or significance, but so what? Enjoy the party.I'll be back at it this year, and by ""it"" I mean following local bands, discovering new ones, subsisting on beer, eating a lot of pulled pork and not sleeping. Here's the actual pitch: It's all going on SecondStoryGarage.com, as well as ColoradoDaily.com. Last year's highlights included Big Freedia twerking, The Yawpers' Nate Cook getting a little dark and profane on camera, and me drunkenly talking about pizza. Much like SXSW, it's a messy grab bag of stuff.Hope you like it, and as always, happy South By.Contact Ashley Dean at 303-473-1109.

AUSTIN, TEXAS—Seeing as how Toronto and Austin signed a “music city” alliance back in October, you’d think the 2014 South by Southwest festival would be awash in evidence of our two cities’ newly strengthened relationship.Yet as the music portion of SXSW kicks into gear on Tuesday there’s not nearly the official Toronto presence one might expect on the streets of Austin. Oh, there are Toronto acts everywhere at this year, as there always are: F---ed Up, the Darcys, Trust, Timber Timbre, Greys, Lowell, Saidah Baba Talibah among them. Related:What Rob Ford, and Toronto, could learn from Austin's music industryBut the sole event actually bearing the City of Toronto stamp is a late-afternoon showcase titled “Toronto Turns Up,” featuring More Or Les, Ariana Gillis, July Talk and the Arkells (who are from Hamilton), at the Canadian Independent Music Association’s “Canada House” headquarters at Friends on 6th St. on Saturday. That’s it.Despite the establishment last month of a 30-member music advisory committee intended to guide Toronto in its efforts to embrace and exploit its thriving music scene in a manner modelled on that of the “Live Music Capital of the World,” only one city staff member, film commissioner Randy McLean (subbing in until Toronto’s plans to establish a music office with an actual music commissioner akin to Austin’s bear fruition) is in Texas in an official capacity for this year’s festival. Several members of that committee are here, yes, but they came on their own (or their company’s) dime, and some of them are wondering if Toronto might not be missing the boat on the whole alliance thing.Even Thursday night’s big “beat battle” at Avenue on Congress between Toronto’s Beat Academy hip-hop crew, led by sometime Drake producer Boi1da and featuring the rising likes of Wondagurl and Rich Kidd, and Texas’s Space City Beats mob happened of its own volition. It was, the Beat Academy’s Toni Morgan says, a “happy coincidence” that they’d been planning a “Toronto vs. Texas” SXSW event when the Toronto/Austin alliance came into being.As Jeff Cohen, co-owner of the Horseshoe Tavern and one of the founders of Collective Concerts, observes, Toronto sent two city councillors to SXSW last year and then followed that visit up by sending a delegation back for the Austin City Limits festival last fall that included a very enthusiastic Mayor Rob Ford.“Five months have passed by since they signed the alliance, and there’s less going on at South by Southwest than there was when there was no alliance,” Cohen said Monday. “I think we’re missing an opportunity. The City of Toronto should have made a big splash at this year’s South by Southwest … It looks like my city dropped the ball. Both (cities) are just losing this great opportunity. Nothing’s been done.”Cohen isn’t being a totally negative Nelly. He concedes Toronto is “making headway” with its Austin alliance, “but it’s at a turtle pace.” And that’s much the same refrain one hears from his fellow industry compatriots down here for SXSW.“I’m happy that the City of Toronto is moving ahead with stuff like the music advisory committee and clearly it’s on their radar screen as something that should be aided and abetted and supported,” says Mike Tanner, director of operations for Toronto’s North by Northeast festival. “On the other hand, in my North by Northeast capacity, I know how big the city bureaucracy can be and, in the interests of getting things right and making sure that proper policies and procedures are followed it can take a long time to get stuff done …. “I think it’s kinda down to the industry to do things in a tangible way that has an effect on the street, so that you see musicians or venues or fans or other people benefitting so it’s not just a piece of paper that was signed by two elected politicians, that it actually has a meaning and an impact that people can feel. “I think a lot of times bureaucracies like to work from the top down, but with something like this I think it might be more effective to work from the foundation up, from the actual events and the actual people and the guys on the ground making stuff happen.”To that end, Tanner and the NXNE crew will work on their own to strengthen their long-held ties with SXSW this year to make that connection “a lot more evident and obvious” in light of the new alliance.“We’ve been in much closer contact with them, sharing some info and some best practices,” he says. “And there may be something that comes to fruition at our festival. I don’t know yet.”Likewise, Amy Terrill of the industry lobby group Music Canada and Toronto’s recently minted “4479: Music Meets World” music-marketing campaign will be conducting business with movers and shakers in the Austin scene on “a more informal basis” during SXSW.“From the industry level in Austin, there’s a lot of interest,” she says, “and I think the frustration is things move a little bit slowly. Certainly, in Toronto, it’s taken a little while to get the advisory committee set up. But there are necessary foundational pieces, and while we may wish the process went a little bit faster, the committee that Toronto has established is a fantastic committee and there’s gonna be a lot of great people on there and it’s gonna do a lot of great work. “It’s just that some things take a little bit longer.“I think the industry-led initiative is where the real magic is gonna happen. So I think that’s okay that that’s where we’re at right now as the city structures get established.”Do you want to help shapethe Toronto Star's future?Join our team of readers who are passionate about journalism and share your views.         Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

557	"Having attended major trade conventions like SIGGRAPH and NAB in the past, I'll say this about SXSW. It's one of the best conventions/festivals/trade shows to be found anywhere in the world. It's well organized, well run (well, except for the wifi) and it's mindblowingly diverse and forward-thinking. But it may have already outgrown its host city, Austin. We have the conventions space and the rentable venues and hotel space (barely, in the latter). What do not have are the roads to keep the festival from becoming a major irritant for the people who actually live and work in Austin.When SXSW isn't in town, Austin's population is about 850,000. When SXSW is in town, that number swells to about 1,050,000. Those people bring a lot of money to town, so there's no question in the grand scheme things that SXSW's visitors are welcome.The roads around the city aren't even built to handle its everyday population. When the city swells by about 25% for SXSW's fortnight, the city's infrastructure simply cannot handle the influx. Despite the fact that Austin's total footpring -- about 272 square miles -- dwarfs Manhattan's 23 square miles, there just isn't room on the roads to deal with such a sudden population surge. And city decisions are making things worse, not better.Today was a good case in point. I-35 is the main artery running through Austin north to south. It doesn't just serve Austin, it leads north to Waco and eventually to Dallas and beyond. South, it hits San Antonio and other arteries that lead to points south including the Texas-Mexico border in Hidalgo County. It's a major trade artery for the state and nation, 24/7/365. But because it only gets to eight lanes maximum as it goes through Austin, and four of those lanes are in the dark, dangerous Death Star trench on the bottom deck, 35 is far too easy to disrupt. Today a pair of what appeared to be minor fender benders shut the whole thing down southbound, backing up traffic and trade for miles.Now, I-35 is federal/state and Austin isn't solely to blame for its thinness. But Austin is to blame for leaving drivers up on 35 with nowhere to go. The city has already been shutting down some of its interior road lanes for bus and bike traffic. Those shutdowns have in turn closed off some parking lots. And with SXSW in town, the city shut down even more interior roads to create a street festival atmosphere. The gridlock on 35 soon became gridlock downtown. There was nowhere to go, nowhere to park. SXSW on-foot attendees probably had little idea that the town around them had gone sclerotic, but for locals who already tend to resent the traffic increase, gridlock became misery.I-35 clearly needs to be dealt with, but so does Austin's habit of going left and fooling around with old ideas. Mayor Lee Leffingwell's big idea is to keep adding bike paths and bus lanes plus ""Rail or Fail,"" essentially, expanding Austin's Metro rail system. Whether you build roads or rails taxpayer dollars will be used and public debt will be increased, but rail is a favorite, and very expensive, rolling obsession of folks of a leftist bent like Leffingwell. Once you build trains, unless they become efficient systems (which they hardly ever do -- see AMTRAC), they become a permanent public expense over and above the roads. Never mind that this is Texas, a sprawling state with sprawling cities where rail tends to be under-used, and never mind that nearly every time a city gets going on a rail project, they go way over budget and end up getting years behind schedule, just to build something that relatively few people use. And never mind that Austin's Metro has been both over budget and behind schedule and still doesn't offer much in the way of flexibility or speed. Or just getting you from Point A to Point B in the time that the rail system promises. Never mind that rail hasn't really worked in either Houston or Austin, at least not yet, both because of the culture here but also because the cities are just so physically spread. Austin's leaders see none of these problems, they just think they haven't told their dazzling story about trains (a 19th Century way of thinking, to be honest) articulately enough.Never mind all that. Austin is already host to major events like SXSW, Austin City Limits and every Longhorn home football game. It's also now the host for F1 racing, though the Circuit of the Americas is located far enough outside downtown to produce less of an impact than events like SXSW. It's the capital of Texas, which is larger than most countries by itself. Austin needs to stop shutting down roads meant for cars in favor of turning them into bike paths or giving them over to bus use as a means of forcing residents and visitors onto public transportation. It should also stop kowtowing to the taxi industry via its misguided crackdown on Uber. If it wants to be a major destination and a big star on the map, then Austin really needs to grow up.

The band is playing four shows, including a showcase at Esther's Follies and a benefit for the Children's Cancer Association alongside Typhoon, Aloe Blacc, Les Claypool, The Bots, Peelander-Z and Arc Iris.The Youngblood Brass Band will also play a show highlighting artists from Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois at Holy Mountain. The March 14 daytime show is a collaboration among Madison's Majestic Theatre, Minneapolis's First Avenue and Chicago's Metro. Other artists representing Wisconsin at the Majestic/First Avenue/Metro show are Madison's Anna Vogelzang, La Crosse's T.U.G.G., Vic and Gab and Hugh Bob & the Hustle, both from Milwaukee.Americana rockers WheelHouse will make the trek from Madison to Austin to play shows on March 13 and 14, at Scholz Garten and Roky Erickson's Ice Cream Social. ""We are super excited, not only to play at what has become a mecca of music, but also to take in some of that warm Austin weather,"" says Wheelhouse lead singer Frank Busch.Henzie-Skogen says he tries not to get too caught up in the hype, especially now that the Youngblood Brass Band has been around as long as it has. He said he's looking forward to eating tacos and seeing friends, and playing a lot of shows in a different scene. The group released a new album late in 2013, and SXSW is a good opportunity to play some shows in between U.S. tours, he said.But for bands at different stages in their careers, it can be an entirely different experience.""For a band like PHOX, who are poised to infiltrate the hearts and minds of the entire universe — and rightfully so — I think it's a very cool, very essential thing, and a great way to stir up some buzz,"" Henzie-Skogen said.The indie-pop group is well on its way to achieving widespread hearts-and-minds infiltration, looking at early SXSW coverage.The seven-piece, whose lead singer once explained that if you like sugared cereal, you'll like PHOX, must have found a lot of people who like sugared cereal. NPR and People Magazine have both featured PHOX as a band to know for this year's festival.SXSW attendees will have four chances to see the Madison band — which recently signed a deal with Partisan Records — while they're in Austin.Email:

And when you go through that many bands you start to see trends in the names. The two most commonly occurring words are always — always — ""black"" and ""DJ."" In addition to those two, this year we noticed that ""white"" appears an awful lot, too, as does the name John. Michael, Paul and Jesse are also pretty popular. Go figure. Using the power of Internology, we compiled a list of all (or nearly all) of the bands playing SXSW this year (there are a lot). Then we used that list to create a tag cloud. The names used most often are in larger type. If you make a new band name using just the most popular words, you'd end up with something like ""Wild White Ghost DJ Black Band."" But the possibilities, just from the pool of words used in this year's batch of SXSW bands, are seemingly endless. Here are a few I came up with: Baby MagicBlood ComedyTeam Joe OrchestraYoung Wild Sound Of course, if you find this colletion of words too limiting, you can always refer to the online Band Name Maker or the Wu-Tang Clan Name Generator (which is reportedly how actor and musician Donald Glover came up with is rap name Childish Gambino). Tell us your new fake band name in the comments section or tweet it @allsongs. And stay tuned for a boatload of coverage on SXSW, coming this week from NPR Music, starting with the All Songs Considered SXSW preview show, coming Tuesday.

During South By Southwest 2014, I tweeted, ""Here's the list of all the amazing tech that launched at #sxsw this year,"" and then posted an image of a 404 'page not found' error. It was a joke, but it felt all too real in Austin.Years ago, when major corporations with massive marketing budgets started to come to Austin and sponsor SXSW Interactive, they were seen as an invading species. On the surface, it was a typical story of colonization: a peaceful and not particularly clean shaven species lives in harmony; a better dressed species with expense accounts causes hotel room prices to skyrocket; the happy, furry people either die out from logo asphyxiation or put on suits and join the invaders.While some feared that narrative, what really happened for awhile was one of symbiosis. Marketers wanted to work with the technologists and tinkerers who had made SXSW their favorite escape. They wanted to reach the early adopters. They wanted to increase their share of voice, but also encourage more conversation. The technology enthusiasts, meanwhile, saw opportunities for private corporations to fund their and validate their business models. As a bonus, the marketers often sponsored pedicabs, food trucks, and open bar parties. For the tech products like Twitter and Foursquare that spread so quickly at SXSW that they attracted mainstream media attention, marketers were lining up to run campaigns. The quest for startups to launch the most buzzed about product excited developers, marketers, and journalists alike.Wither startup?
This year, however, that quest plateaued. Startups were everywhere in Austin, but the buzz about individual startups was muted. I kept asking people what startups and technologies they saw that were exciting. Barely any could name any startups that stood out, even though many of those people had a number of startup executives' business cards in their pockets. A lot of marketing executives were meeting with startups, but usually these were companies they had heard of or were recommended by agencies or venture capital firms. Few people I spoke experienced anything completely new.Some of the more interesting technologies were those deployed by large brands, rather than startups. Oreo used 3D printers to create cookies on demand based on trending topics. IBM branded a food truck that used its Watson technology to recommend ingredients. Jagermeister (a client) promoted a new mobile social application. None of these featured prominent startup partnerships. Yet all tap into technologies like rapid prototyping, recommendation engines, and mobile video that continue to be important areas of innovation by startups and major brands alike. Meanwhile, automotive brands such as Chevrolet are showcasing advances in telematics - an area where startups have typically been far less pronounced compared to the car manufacturers themselves.Branding, branding everywhere
In this sense, brands really have taken over the domain that they know best: buzz. Many brands have matched their sponsorship investments with investments in strategy, creativity, and public relations that have turned SXSW into yet another brand bowl. Who won? Google, Samsung, Mondelez, Chevrolet, or IBM? What about surprise entrants like Pennzoil with its real-life Mario Kart races? None of it matters, even though the buzz of the big brands is drowning out that of the startup brands.What does matter then? I spoke with a senior marketing executive from a financial services company, and he told me he'd rather spend half a million dollars to send 100 people from his company to Austin than create some branded experience there. So many brand marketers are using that approach, even if for many, it's more like sending 5 or 10 or 20 people. Practically every marketer I encountered said they sent more people this year than ever. And they're motivated to learn and forge connections, even if they party as hard as the Interactive veterans too.That's why SXSW hasn't become some logo-fueled episode of Invasion of the Startup Buzz Snatchers. Startups still have the upper hand here. They're the main attraction. Marketers are lining up to meet the best of them, whether the startups are doing something totally new or they have spent the past few years proving their models. These marketers don't even care who counts as a startup. What marketers appreciate is that SXSW attracts a self-selecting mass of creative, interesting, innovative and curious technologists. Marketers want to learn from almost any of them, partner with the most relevant ones, and perhaps invest in, acquire, or try to compete with those they think are most impactful to their business.That makes it harder to write stories about what startup got the most buzz. But it does provide the underpinning for the stories that will spring up through next year's SXSW and beyond.

Anything can happen in Austin. Be prepared.The last thing anyone would say about South By Southwest is that it's an avenue for self-improvement. The annual mega gathering, which began last week for film and interactive-technology mavens and turns into a music conference and festival tomorrow, fulfills many needs for the culture nerd. Communal bonding? Yes – somewhere around 100,000 people will wander the Austin streets looking to high-five each other during this time. Fun? For sure. This is the entertainment industry's spring break, with much better music that what you'd hear at the Flora-Bama border, and mercifully fewer bros in board shorts. Excess? That's a given, whether your pleasure comes in a plastic cup, folded into a tortilla or pouring out of a nightclub's speakers. But soul edification? Inner peace? It's about as likely to hit you at SXSW as it is during a game of Temple Run.Yet after twenty-plus years of on-and-off attendance, I've discovered that there is a key to discovering the Hidden Wisdom of South By Southwest. This kind of self-help goes beyond what any herbal remedy, extra phone battery or pair of sensible shoes offers. Those practical survival tools are givens. So is some modicum of misery, born of overabundance. That's the paradox of choice. But the too-muchness of SXSW can become a route to knowing yourself better, as a music lover, a listener, and a cultural explorer.Here are some things you can do to make your South By Southwest experience not just a gauntlet to survive, but also a source of renewal. Making these choices can benefit anyone who comes to Austin, badge on lanyard – newcomers and veterans alike – and even those following along remotely, from the comfort of a Wi-Fi enabled home. It turns out that what makes South By Southwest more than bearable is exactly what makes loving music so important. To quote my favorite actual self-help book, it's all about embracing the full catastrophe.

Travel can expand you, and in Austin, you can cross half a dozen time zones most nights without even leaving downtown. The international scope of SXSW is one of its most impressive elements. Where else can you see South Korea's biggest rock band one night and a Norwegian psych-rock supergroup the next? Exploring international music in Austin is a great way to attune your ears to wider frequencies in general. Newcomers will learn whole new languages, if not literally, in spirit. For veterans, there's no better way to get out of a listening rut. Folks playing at home can create their own staycation by going through globally-minded attendees' playlists at their own pace.

Like so many aspects of the wired world, SXSW offers far too much choice for mere humans to manage. One coping mechanism can actually become a kind of mind-body practice. Sit still. Choose a venue, and just stay there as one artist surrenders the stage to another. Such a calm approach combats the worst problem of the festival — missing every set you want to see because you can't get from venue to venue quickly enough. More than that, it allows for space to open up inside, in the meditative moments between sets. Newbies need this break from cultural ADHD more than anyone, and veterans can rest their older backs as well as their brains. Online opportunities like this abound, for those at home, too; start with NPR Music's own showcase, streaming from Stubb's on Wednesday night.
                Seriously, guys, go to a panel. The rock 'n' roll will wait for you.

Seriously, guys, go to a panel. The rock 'n' roll will wait for you.South By Southwest started as a small gathering where people really talked to each other, not just about music and barbecue, but about the practice of music-making. That part of the conference still exists, though it can get lost among all the day parties. Go find it. The panels offered daily at the Austin Convention Center feature the most exciting thinkers in music and technology today, talking informally about every aspect of music culture. Newcomers can gather practical advice and learn history at panels, while avoiding too-many-margaritas burnout. Veterans can loosen up old ways of thinking. Remote followers who are up (and probably at work) while the ears of Austin's late-to-rise hordes are still ringing softly on their pillows can find out what ideas are catching fire by checking in with the bloggers who get up before 3 p.m. each day and grab serious material.

Bob Boilen, host of NPR Music's All Songs Considered, interviews Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone of The Zombies at SXSW.Everybody knows that the musical sets at SXSW can be hit or miss. Time constraints, shared sound systems and overcrowded rooms work against artists really shining. You know where that happens? Back at the conference, where artists in one-on-one public conversations share stories and insights in a relaxed atmosphere. This year's line-up includes, among others, Blondie, Gary Numan, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, Cee Lo Green, Ana Tijoux and St. Vincent (I'm doing that one. Can't wait!) I'm perennially shocked that every one of these special events isn't packed; people are too busy eating migas to partake, I guess. But the benefits are obvious. Newbies can bask in the aura of heroes. Veterans can get on the mic and ask that question they've always wanted to ask. And for those at home, SXSW archives many of these conversations, along with other panels. So you can luxuriate in superstar insights while taking a bath.
                Imagine what would happen if you just followed this guy.

Here's one case where a self-help bromide really applies to the particularities of SXSW. Let go. Things will go wrong. You won't be able to make it to La Zona Rosa at midnight; the line for your fifth-choice day party will stretch around the block; you'll have forgotten your earplugs at an ""acoustic"" set that turns out to be louder than Metallica. When these little disasters happen, just do something different. SXSW is sprawl at a level that Rust Cohle couldn't imagine. A million amazing things take place simultaneously, from satellite festivals to unofficial bar shows to busking sessions and hotel room sets. Newbies will get a rush by simply immersing in the flow. For veterans, loosened schedules create chances to tap into longstanding information networks and find something great beyond the madding crowds. Remote observers will enjoy the benefits of these roulette spins in time, because surprise is often what reveals the next buzz band.
                Don't try to go it alone at SXSW. There could be a friend and guide right over your shoulder.

A hundred thousand people, and you're just going to hang with your old pals? It's natural, and on some level safer, to stick to companions you know. Wild cards fill the streets during SXSW. But if your head is clear, don't be afraid to strike up conversations. Newcomers, you need mentors. If you hear a wise voice on a panel, connect afterwards; often, people are happy to share expertise and even maybe a coffee. Elders, the kids know where the scene you haven't yet discovered is forming. Share a pedicab across the freeway. And Web-enabled observers, you have the biggest collection of new friends at your disposal — get on Twitter or in a chat room and benefit from others' adventure stories. Whole new worlds of listening are just a recommendation away.And this leads to my final word of wisdom about SXSW. It doesn't stop in March. I could mean this in some kind of spiritual way — keep that feeling of serendipity alive in your ever-rockin' soul! -- but really, all I mean is at least half of the artists you wanted to see will be playing your town before the end of October. And if you'd rather just stay inside forever, there are those Web archives to explore. So don't despair. Never despair. The Hidden Wisdom will carry you through.The Record is the ongoing story of how people find, make, buy, share and talk about music.

566	SXSW 2014 is upon us, which means that thousands of bands have swarmed to the annual music festival in Austin, Texas — and that tens of thousands of attendees have followed, eager to see their favorite stars emerge from a giant Doritos machine or play a “secret” show to hundreds of fans. While they’re at it, they might discover a new sound or two.After all, you could see Coldplay, Lady Gaga, 50 Cent and Soundgarden at the South By Southwest Music Conference, which runs from March 11–16 this year, but the major acts are not the only attraction. SXSW has emerged as an essential destination for up-and-coming groups eager to get themselves in front of new fans and old music executives.Even if you’re not heading to Austin for the music festival, it’s a great opportunity to find new musical acts to fill your playlist. To help you sift through the over 2,000 bands heading to Austin this week, here are 17 bands to watch at SXSW or elsewhere:HighasakiteListen: “Since Last Wednesday”If you’ve never heard someone rock a zither before, be sure to check out Norwegian Grammy nominee Highasakite. The band was invited to tour with Bon Iver after Justin Vernon was blown away by their dreamy indie pop.SkatersListen: “Miss Teen Massachusetts”This just-out-of-the-gate New York group delivers energetic garage rock that earns them apt comparisons to The Strokes. Their debut album, Manhattan, is filled with songs that crackle with electricity and infectious enthusiasm sure to make you a fan.Hurray for the Riff RaffListen: “The Body Electric”Frontwoman Alynda Lee Segarra is from New Orleans-by-way-of-The Bronx, and that’s an apt description for her music, too. Her debut album, Small Town Heroes, gracefully blends idiosyncratic eras and genres for a sweetly gritty Americana sound.The WytchesListen: “Digsaw”This Brighton, UK-based three-piece are riding a wave of surf-psych rock across the pond in the hopes of putting America under their spell. The band cites Leonard Cohen and Black Sabbath as influences for the narco-hazy “Paint It Black”-esque riffs they’ve dubbed “surf doom,” but there’s no real comparison for their sound.Sir SlyListen: “Gold”Alt-pop trio Sir Sly have flown under the radar in the States so far, but they are poised to make big waves at SXSW. The band is signed to the same UK label who preached the gospel of Haim, Atlas Genius and Chvrches early on — and Cherrytree Records in the U.S., which is home to Feist, Robyn and Disclosure among others— and Sir Sly’s dark pop tunes fit in well with that company. Their danceable, if occasionally melancholic, tracks are laden with enough pop hooks and sing-along choruses to be genuine crowdpleasers.TinkListen: “Take Me There”Chicago upstart Trinity Home, a.k.a. Tink, could be either the next Nicki Minaj or the next Ashanti, and she has the chops to rival both. On the four mix tapes the 18-year old has released so far, she drifts effortlessly between R & B groovers and knock-’em-down, beat-laden tracks — and delivers on all fronts.Dawn LandesListen: “Bluebird”The Kentucky-bred New Yorker just released her first full-length in four years and she makes up for lost time on Bluebird. The album is a smart mix of alt-folk, country and indie pop experimentation that goes down like a beer bong of sweet tea.AanListen: “I Don’t Need Love”Portland, Ore., has a reputation for being a hothouse for musical taste-makers and trendsetters. Aan makes good on that reputation with their complex, challenging rock. The band has been around since 2007, but only recently put out their debut album, Amor Ad Nauseum. Apparently it can take awhile to capture their brand of perfection.TemplesListen: “Shelter Song”Temples have been making a name for themselves in England’s psychedelic pop scene, based on their undeniably groovy sound, which is rooted in the 1960s with hefty helpings of Motown, glam and Krautrock sprinkled throughout. Temples have been receiving lots of well-deserved attention throughout the UK, including praise from the likes of Johnny Marr and Oasis’ Noel Gallagher.TorresListen: “Honey”Singer-songwriter Torres mines the same musical vein that Sharon Van Etten and Waxahatchee do, and strikes gold each time she hits the stage with her lucky Gibson guitar in hand. Torres comes to her shows armed with a gorgeous, vulnerable croon and a litany of intricate, tender songs sure to woo all comers. September GirlsListen: “Heartbeats” The band may take their name from a Big Star song, but the songs that the Dublin five-piece craft sound like what would happen if the Bangles started a My Bloody Valentine cover band. The floating vocals and fuzzed out guitar make for memorable tunes and inescapable earworm melodies.TensnakeListen: “Love Sublime” feat. Nile Rogers and FloraBerlin-based producer Tensnake knows how to fill a dance floor and has traveled the world doing just that for years, building a reputation as one of the premiere house and disco producers out there. Now he is getting ready to release his debut album, Glow. It’s due out March 11th but is already earning accolades for its raw emotion, crossover dance-pop appeal and modern disco feel.ÁsgeirListen: “King and Cross”Ásgeir Trausti is barely known in the U.S. — but in Iceland he’s huge.  One in 10 Icelanders own his album, In the Silence, which has already outpaced sales of albums by fellow Icelandic acts Björk and Sigur Rós. The 22-year old singer-songwriter works in sweetly hushed acoustic numbers with lyrics frequently penned by his 70-something father, accompanied by synths and pianos and electronic trappings, which, when paired with his soaring voice, build irrepressible harmonies sure to win over audiences outside of Iceland in no time.AlvvaysListen: “Adult Diversion”Toronto’s Alvvays are a vvarmly bright new project by Molly Rankin, who is descended from Canadian folk royalty and uses her talents to make wistfully jangly, bittersweet Brit pop. The quintet’s lo-fi sound pairs perfectly with Rankin’s breathy vocals to create guitar-driven confections sure to earn a place on your playlist.Bipolar SunshineListen: “Love More Worry Less”Adio Marchant, a.k.a. Bipolar Sunshine, infuses warmth into his electronic-tinged pop songs. He cites David Bowie, Kanye West, reggae and The Carpenters among those who influenced his songs, which frequently pair heartfelt, yearning lyrics with lush arrangements. His distinctive style will undoubtedly garner this British singer/songwriter plenty of attention in Texas.Black MilkListen: “Sunday’s Best / Monday’s Worst”Detroit-based producer and rapper Curtis Cross, a.k.a. Black Milk, has worked with J. Dilla, Danny Brown and Jack White, but is making a name for himself with his album No Poison No Paradise. The semi-autobiographical album tells the story of a man and his dreams in a flurry of unrelenting rap that will take you to church and back again.Ava LunaListen: “PRPL”The Brooklyn five-piece delivers soulful funk sounds with pretty harmonies and an endearingly punky brashness. The band just released their second album, Electric Balloon, and to call it an eclectic mix is an understatement. The band blends full-on no wave rockers with R & B inspired slow burners with a little of everything in between, which just means that there’s something for everyone at their shows.MORE: 14 Musical Acts To Watch in 2014MORE: 14 Albums To Look Forward To In 2014	Entertainment

The concert to take place on the cross over night between South by Southwest’s Interactive week and Music week, will be shared around the globe via the live streaming social media app, Hang w/ – it will take place at Austin’s historic at 1100 Warehouse on March 11, at 8pm. 50 Cent (who is also an investor in the company) said, “I’m going to bring my fans behind the scenes and give the opportunity to those who couldn’t make it a chance to experience a concert at South by Southwest.”The Hang w/ app allows users to “hang with” each other via live video and simultaneous chat. Users follow other users who interest them, and the system sends a notification every time someone in a user’s “following” network goes live. Hang w/ will enlist hundreds of concert attendees to broadcast the 50 Cent concert live to their friends, colleagues, and social media connections creating a concert around the globe.“This is going to be a pivotal event in Hang w/ history,” said Andrew Maltin, co-founder and CEO of Hang With, Inc. “Hang w/ has shown itself to be a powerful technology platform for musicians to engage their fans, and we are thrilled at the opportunity to showcase our platform in front of the who’s who of music and tech, courtesy of 50 Cent, who himself lives at the intersection of music and tech.”The platform, which reached the 1,000,000 download milestone only nine months after launch, continues to release powerful key performance indicators. Recently, the platform released metrics that showed fans are substantially more likely to tune in to a celebrity’s Hang w/ broadcast than they are to engage in comparable metrics on leading social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Dave Swartz, co-founder and President of Hang With, Inc., said, “We are thrilled to be headlining South by Southwest Interactive crossover night with our partner 50 Cent and bridge the gap for artists and fans for a one of a kind experience all over the world.”Those interested in following 50 Cent and receiving push notifications when he is broadcasting live can download the app at http://www.hangwith.me/50cent.– Scott Randell (@DefinedByMvsic) 50 centsxswComin' at you live from The Source Magazine.

I arrived in Austin this weekend with just that — plus my bicycle — to cover South by Southwest for Take Two. On Sunday, I headed over to the interactive show floor to check out the best new digital creations. What I discovered was a whole lot of gimmicks. Take this life size ""Operation"" board, for example.And then there were the folks who lined up to play the ""Price is Right.""Fun and games at SXSWI did, however, discover some pretty awesome wearable tech in a conference room at the Hilton. Interested in an Iron Man-like motorcycle helmet? Listen in to my Take Two segment for more. Completely wrecked by jet lag and daylight saving, I made my way to Joe's Bakery with Armando Rayo Monday morning for the pride of Austin breakfast cuisine. Not everything is bigger in Texas. Case in point: instead of eating giant breakfast burritos like we do here in California, Austinites prefer small breakfast tacos.Full of bacon, cheese, eggs, Mexican chorizo, salsa verde, jalapenos, beans and tons of other homemade goodness — this is what Texans love. When I brought up the idea of breakfast burritos to an owner at Joe's, she scoffed and said that people from California always ask for them. She didn't understand why.I'll refrain from debating the merits of the breakfast burrito vs the breakfast taco here — because I'll be doing exactly that on Take Two Tuesday. Check out KPCC for daily updates from Jacob.

Tomorrow (March 11), thousands of bands, journalists and music fans descend onto Austin, Texas for the annual SXSW Music Conference. Like always, there will be tons of parties, lines, food, and too many decisions to make about which acts to catch. Here are Billboard's 10 best bets for the week -- acts that have a strong buzz going and could have a breakout year after the madness ends.SXSW 2014: Full CoverageReal Estate  Real Estate are quickly becoming the preferred purveyors of sunny jangle-pop in the indie-rock world. Their new album, ""Atlas"" (Domino) was recorded at Wilco's Chicago studio The Loft and finds the band continuing down the path of well-crafted songs that evoke a romantic, yet nostalgic vibe that's always warm and inviting. As simple, refined pop song writers, it's hard to beat these guys right now.    Cloud Nothings  Cleveland's Cloud Nothings have gained a steady following over the last few years with a raucous live show and a never-ending supply of post-punk songs. Their fourth album, ""Here and Nowhere Else"" (Mom + Pop/Carpark) is due out on April 1 and frontman Dylan Baldi has promised that the music within the eight songs is ""more positive"" this time around.    Chance the Rapper  This time last year, Chicago hip-hop artist Chance the Rapper was relatively unknown on the national scene, as he was prepping his throwback, breakout mixtape ‘Acid Rap.’ 12 months later, he's recorded with Justin Bieber, James Blake and Lil Wayne to name just a few.    Hurray for the Riff Raff  Most music that comes out of New Orleans tends to lean towards the Crescent City's funk roots, but Hurray for the Riff Raff hone in on the south's gothic-folk traditions that would sound at home in any club on Music Row. Centered around Alynda Lee Segarra’s charming, southern voice, the band's new album ""Small Town Heroes"" (ATO) is an excellent take on classic country traditions.    Dum Dum Girls  The promise of the Dum Dum Girls has existed for years, but the L.A. band's new album, ""Too True"" (Sub Pop) is a strong leap forward. It combines the group's love of fuzzed-out distorted guitars and vintage '80s goth the Cure and Siouxsie Sioux, as lead Dum Dum Girl Dee Dee Penny blurs the line between tortured artist and confident rock-star.    RAC  RAC used to stand for ""Remix Artist Collective"" where it was just that -- a few DJs that did fancy mash-ups. Nowadays, it's just the solo project of original RAC member André Allen Anjos, a master-mixer from Portland, Oregon. He's releasing his debut album ""Stranger"" (Cherrytree/Interscope) in two parts this spring, with guest spots from Tegan and Sara, Penguin Prison and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros' Alex Ebert. It's EDM-tinged pop ready to break into the Top 40.    Charli XCX  Charli XCX broke out in 2013, but not with her album ‘True Romance.’ Instead, she saw a song she wrote, ""I Love It,"" top the charts for Icona Pop. She's currently at work on her third album, which she describes as ""very punk inspired."" For dance artists these days, that could mean anything. She recently lit up the internet with Iggy Azalea in a video they did for Azalea's new single ""Fancy,” in which they brilliantly reenacted the 1995 Alicia Silverstone film ""Clueless."" For those in search of the next Ellie Goulding, Charli's poised to rise up.    Eagulls  On Eagulls' self-titled debut (Partisan), the Leeds, UK five-piece blend a sound that evokes the Pixies' melodic brand of punk rock and the Horrors gloomy vocals. The band is just two years old, but write music that's emotionally charged with powerful guitars and a rather brash attitude. Punk purists can take solace in the fact that their clip for ""Nerve Endings,"" which won the NME award for ""Best Music Video,"" featured a rotting pig brain.    Ty Dolla $ign  Wiz Khalifa protégé Ty Dolla $ign has hustled well-received singles and mixtapes out for the last several years and is currently prepping his debut album ""Free TC"" (Taylor Gang Records/Atlantic), due out later this year. But fans got a taste of Ty in January, when he released ""Beach House EP,"" a 7-song official introduction that features a slew of top-notch guests including B.o.B., French Montana, DJ Mustard, Trey Songz, and of course, Wiz. Right now, he's angling to be rap's next big thing.    Timber Timbre  Timber Timbre is the musical project of Canadian musician Taylor Kirk and on his sultry new album, ""Hot Dreams"" (Arts & Crafts), he expands on the dark humor and sparse rock arrangements that lined his previous four albums. It sounds like Nick Cave soundtracking a romantic date night, but not in a creepy way. In the past, the band has supported Feist and Laura Marling and their music has been featured in ‘Breaking Bad.’ It's only a matter of time before the cool kids latch on.

570	"Much like ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Seth Meyers, your music critic is in Austin, Texas, this week for the SXSW music festival, a five-day adventure of bands, beers and more bands. Before heading out, I surveyed a baker's dozen of Portland bands to see why the trek's worth it and named a few local acts to watch out for among the thousands invading the city.  I've been in Austin a day and a half and already been to an ear-rattling house show, eaten a fried avocado taco and attempted to devour a full pound of brisket and ribs from Austin BBQ institution Franklin. (I failed; I'll try again when they're in town in August for Feast Portland.) Check in on Oregonlive.com/music and Twitter all week for photo galleries, behind-the-scenes moments and live updates on bands from Portland and beyond. The fest kicks off properly on Tuesday, with the locals-only Portland Party on Wednesday afternoon -- look for my galleries and write-ups to follow. I'll also be moderating an SXSW panel on Thursday about modern music discovery with Bandcamp's Andrew Jervis and others. I'll be skipping the Lady Gaga Doritos concert, though.  Are you in Austin? Let me know. If not: what do you want to see covered this week? Band discoveries? Interviews? Portraits? Taco photos? I'll do my best to make it happen. -- David Greenwald

572	"By Reggie Ugwu  | March 10, 2014 11:27 AM EDTSouth By Southwest, which kicked off Friday with SXSW Interactive (March 7-11) and SXSW Film (March 7-15) followed by SXSW Music (March 11–16), is one of the year's most prominent music events and, as is often said, the most overwhelming. For at least a decade, industry pros have complained the confab is marred by overpopulation, innumerable events at all hours of the day and night, corporate sponsorship ad nauseum— all of which beg the perennial question: Has SXSW jumped the shark? In 2012, the number of people who attended at least one SXSW activity totaled some 155,000. With that in mind, Billboard polled a brain trust of veteran music execs to get expert strategies for how best to approach the conference; and to explain why, exactly, it's still worth the ticket to Austin. Today, Billboard.biz talks to Michael ""Goldie"" Goldstone, founder, Mom + Pop Records, for his seasoned perspective on the industry's annual Texas takeover.It’s spring break for me, too, in a way. I try to balance seeing people that I want to see for fun, seeing people that we work with, which is always fun, and seeing artists from all over the world and the country that are viable to check out. It’s a very sort of frantic, manic, awesome festival, but if you try to accomplish too much you end up not accomplishing much at all -- and it’s not as rewarding.This year we have 5 or 6 bands playing a lot of showcases. Lucius, Cloud Nothings, Tokyo Police Club, Wild Cub and a couple others that haven’t been announced yet. Every year I try to refine how I allocate my time. You always want to be first and foremost present and engaged and committed to the artists that you work with. You start with your artists and identify the shows that could potentially be the most compelling, and you build your schedule around that. ""I'm not gonna lie, this year I'm not going in expecting much.""   -SickamoreWe’ve been able to get radio people from all across the country to come see our bands as a captive audience. So you could take the position of “I’m not sure what SXSW does,” or you can add up all the little intangibles about it and believe that you’re creating a presence.When it comes to new talent, you’re getting a lot of tips from lawyers, publishers, managers, agents and more about what they’re showcasing. I make a list of artists I want to see based on where those recommendations are coming from. You have to comb the sandbox and do your homework and try to do as much research as you can and listen to as many things as you’re able to. I’ll build playlists and work through them.Sometimes I’ve gone down there, gotten turned on to music while I’m at the conference and then weeks or months later I’ve been able to get involved with that artist. That happened with Poliça and it happened with Lucius. I was inspired and encouraged to go see a show and the show was great. A couple of months later, we were able to do a deal with the band. So you know, I love the fact that everything is possible. Obviously, South By is still valuable.You have to have a certain level of flexibility down there and soak up the environment and enjoy it rather than trying to see every possible unsigned artist or every show that all of your bands are playing. It’s a process that has its own ebb and flow to it.If there are 3 or 4 things happening at a given time, it might be best to just stay where you are if you’re hanging with people that you want to spend time with or having a conversation with someone you don’t really know. Do you really want to try and grab a pedicab and skip halfway across town to catch the last couple of songs of something that you’re not really sure about anyway?

573	This section was created by Content Works, Postmedia’s commercial content studio.March 10, 201411:55 AM EDTEntrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women’s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference. This year it’s different.“It’s definitely changed,” said Cannon, an Austin, Texas- based vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz LLP. “I’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It’s just, ‘Sally, the engineer.’”As startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female- focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what has traditionally been a male- dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.The shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook Inc.’s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.Bro-gramming CultureStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year’s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare Inc. took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named “breakout app” in 2011.This year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Oregon-based Palo Alto Software Inc., was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry’s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as “brogrammers.”“Part of that is the ‘bro-gramming’ and too-cool-for- school attitude that goes on,” she said in an interview before her meeting. “What women have to push really hard about is you don’t have to be successful in a man’s world — it’s just the world.”Look HarderParsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference’s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.Hugh Forrest, the symposium’s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.“If I had a dime for everybody who said that’s a great rule but there just aren’t enough qualified women I’d be rich, rich, rich,” he said. “My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It’s impossible for me to believe that you can’t find a female speaker in the world who isn’t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.”Man’s WorldAmong the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women’s issues this year was a March 7 talk “Starting Up in a Man’s World” that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.The lineup contrasts with other technology conferences, some of which have been permeated by a boys club atmosphere. Last year after programming event Pycon in Santa Clara, California, developer evangelist Adria Richards received threats of violence when she posted online an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at the event.Parsons said there are deeper concerns that females in technology face that need to be addressed outside of conferences and within companies.Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture-capital firm last year alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment.The Menlo Park, Californa-based firm, which provided startup financing to Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., later lost a bid to avoid a public trial.C-Suite WomenStill, more women are taking executive roles at technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, who started her job more than six months pregnant. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sandberg wrote the book “Lean In” to inspire other females.Carley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers — like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.“The number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers,” she said in a panel on entrepreneurship at the forum. “They have the ideas, but they don’t have that best friend they can sit with and jam code.”www.bloomberg.com	Entertainment
574	"Head here to visit The 405's SXSW 2014 hub.With the Music side of SXSW kicking off today, Shell Zenner has put together a rather handy A-Z guide of bands playing this week. She's also put together a playlist, which you can listen to below.The 1975 - are impossible to categorise, so it's quite fitting that they are the only number-based band that I've mentioned in this list. Their debut self-titled album was a smash hit in the UK in 2013 and the US should take notice.
A-ges and Ages have a sound that builds and builds and I think that their folky uplifting vibes will generate one of the feel good sets of the festival. If you're more of a cool kid, then Neon Gold records ASTR, a duo from New City and their electronic vibes should enlighten your ears.  If you like your music more on the eclectic side of the tracks then don't miss Afrikan Boy.B-ANKS has been all over the tips for 2014 lists and I'll be vying for a place in a venue to see her showcase her incredible vocals. Manchester son Bipolar Sunshine will be bringing his impressive pop vibes along for the ride, or if you need to check a raw live show then Bo Ningen are the band for you. Austin favourites The Black Angels and the Black Lips will be rocking out and Bear's Den, Boy & Bear and Breton will all be an impressive watch. Personally I'm hoping to grab my first glance of Big Ups and a shed load of BBQ.C-hance The Rapper's shows would probably only be harder to get into if he was wearing a meat dress.. so queue early guys and gals. Cate Le Bon's live shows are an absolute treat so try not to miss out! Sheffield band The Crookes secured UK music industry funding to bring third album Soapbox back to the US and other recommendations on my list are Carousel, Casual Sex, Chloe Howl, CYMBALS, Chet Faker and Cherry Glazerr.D-renge have slayed everything and everyone in their path over the past couple of years and Austin is the next place on their list. Watch out! Electronic vibes aplenty with Duologue and Dauwd playing and UK acts Daley and Dems should figure in your plans too.
E-agulls released their incredible punk debut album last week, Electric eye and Empress Of impressed me at Iceland Airwaves festival and Ezra Furman will be a definite one to check out live.F-at White Family's shows have been renowned in the UK of late as messy and mental affairs and it's bound to be HOT HOT HOT in Austin. Austin based Feathers toured with Depeche Mode in the last month or so. Liverpool artist Forest Swords released a rather special album in 2013 which you really should hear.G-ossling has an unmistakeable voice that I can't wait to check out live, but you should wrap your ears around Glass Animals, Glitches, GRMLN and Gems too!H-ighasakite sound delicious in more ways than one with their brand of Norwegian indie pop and are high on my list to check out live. H Hawkline not only plays in Cate Le Bon's band but will be stepping out of the shadows to play solo at the festival. HAERTS and Holy Esque will also be showcasing new music which I'm keen to hear.I-ndian Jewelry were completely impressive at Austin Psychfest 2013 and lend a slightly more leftfield sound to the proceedings. The Burger Records and Austin Psychfest line-ups will be must sees this year.J-ungle are incredibly hard to google, very mysterious and will be one of the hype bands at this year's festival. Jessy Lanza and Jetta will also be on my list of fresh new female talent to check on the show this year!
K-ins are from Brighton yet I travelled to Leicester to finally see them live. Saying that, they're worth travelling to Austin to see. I have yet to experience the wonder that is Kirin J Callinan live - his one Manchester show had rave reviews and I'll see you down the front yeah?L-a Luz from Seattle are an all girl group that I wish to get to know better! I won't be missing them for sure. Lizzo will be offering some bangers and other choice picks are London Grammar, Lowell and the upbeat sound of Lucius. 
M-Ø is at the top of my M list after a huge queue stopped me seeing her In Iceland! Melt Yourself Down have incredible live shows though, so get yourself down for sure!
N-o Joy and their brooding sound will bliss you out and Nina Nesbitt is certainly one to watch.The O-rwells ramshackle and energetic live show will be just the tonic after too many tacos.P-erfect Pussy released a tape on Captured Tracks last year and have their debut album due for release next week. Manchester babes Pins will blow your mind and if you want to get stoned and starving, I suspect there is no one better to do it with than Parquet Courts. Painted Palms, Panama, Petite Noir, Phantogram, The Preatures and Prides are also stellar additions to the SXSW line up.
Q-uilt. Yes I love my bed and their album HUGELY. Must see.R-oyal Blood have UK shows set up supporting Arctic Monkeys and were one of the BBC's tips for 2014. You'd be a fool not to see them. Radkey, Rathborne, RDGLDGRN, Roosevelt, Royal Canoe and Ryan Hemsworth are all on my list too!
S-pires just released a seven inch on Too Pure Singles club and if you dig Temples then check them. Jules and Sandra from Dum Dum Girls feature in Sisu who I'll definitelu be checking out and I'm in love with the poppy summery Ski Lodge album so I'll be seeing that for sure! Montreal's Solids, Supreme Cuts and Sylvan Esso will be in demand too.T-humpers released their debut album on Subpop recently and have supported Chvrches too! Tallows, Team Me, TEEN, Teeth Of The Sea, To Kill A King, TOPS, TORRES, Tourist, Traams and of course Temples will all be a good way to spend your time.
U-ntil The Ribbon Breaks will be playing the British Embassy alongside UNKNWN and it's a free RSVP if you're quick. Showcase the taste of the UK!V-ancouver Sleep Clinic offer atmospheric sounds from Brisbane, Australia and are riding high in the Amazing Radio chart at present. Australia also has another great musical export in Vance Joy who will be impressing ears.W-olf Alice, Woman's Hour and The Wytches are three of the UK's most exciting emerging artists at present, in terms of American talent, Washed Out, Wet and the awesome Wanda Jackson are playing!X is for eXhausted. You will be after five days full on in Austin!Y-oung Summer is the moniker of DC based singer songwriter Bobbie Allen who's at the top of my Y list, closely followed by Young Fathers and Young Magic.The Z-oltars are based in Austin, channel garage rock vibes and have released on Burger and Sundae Records.

578	An app that translates text within photos, an online mental health service and a teched-out motorcycle helmet all claimed a spot among the nation’s hottest new technologies on Sunday, each earning top honors at the premier startup competition at the South by Southwest convention in Austin.Narrowed down from 48 on Saturday, 18 entrepreneurs pitched their startups to a panel of judges during the final round of the SXSW Accelerator on Sunday, vying for the grand prize in six different areas of technology. The winners each received $4,000, an invitation to next year’s convention, and most importantly, a prestigious and historically lucrative title in the world of technology startups.“It’s fantastic for us, and what’s most important is the exposure that comes with it,” Connor Dickie, whose Canadian company won in the competition’s innovative world category, said in an interview following the event. “It shows people what we’re doing and where biotech is heading.”Dickie’s company, Synbiota, offers an online, crowdsourced platform where scientists can share information and streamline the research and development stages in the production of new foods, fuels and medicines. Some of the funding the company received Sunday will go toward a “hackathon” the company plans to host in Ontario bringing together Internet wizards and biotech scientists. In the wearable technology category, Skully Helmets of San Francisco won for its motorcycle helmet that displays information like driving directions inside the visor and features a rear-view camera that allows riders to see directly behind them without turning their head.Another San Francisco company, ThriveOn, came out on top in the health category for an app that provides an online, personalized program meant to improve mental health. And Israeli company Samba.me landed the grand prize in social technology for a video messaging app that captures video of recipients watching the original video and adds their “reaction” footage to the original.Irish startup Trustev won in the big data category for online identity verification software intended to help merchants combat e-commerce fraud. And lastly, in the the entertainment and content contest, Rhode Island-based Waygo came out on top for its mobile app that lets users scroll over text in, say, Chinese or Japanese characters and see in real-time the translation in English.“The $4,000 is just icing on the cake,” Ryan Rogowski, one of the founders of Waygo, said in an interview, noting that the company will likely use some of that capital to explore new marketing tactics and distribution channels. “Meeting these other teams and introducing ourselves to new potential investors, that’s the real benefit” he added.SXSW Accelerator boasts an impressive lists of pasts participants, many of whom were first introduced to the world at South by Southwest. Siri, which was later acquired by Apple for its now-famous voice-to-text technology, Bump, which was later acquired by Google for its touch-to-share technology, and social media company Klout all passed through the SXSW Accelerator in Austin.In fact, since the competition debuted six years ago, the 208 finalists have collectively raised more than $580 million in funding.“Here, it’s all about developing relationships and making new ones,” Rogowski said.

581	 Steve Winter, special to wtop.com  AUSTIN, Texas — We all know that the International Consumer Electronic Show is a  four-day, 96-hour non-stop party.  Sponsor bashes, media showcase events, nightclub soirees and all the enticements,  libations and entrapments that only a city like Vegas can offer makes CES a  dynamic round-the-clock attraction.  But South-by-Southwest – commonly referred to as SXSW – now that’s a party.  Day One was barely in the books at the Austin Convention Center Friday when the  happy hours started sprouting like weeds.  It didn’t matter if you were in the Registrant’s Tent in the Marriott Parking lot,  in the lobby of the Hilton Austin Downtown or in a meeting room that just hours  earlier played host to an interactive session or a film seminar.  The carousing started early and continued well into the night.  No question, the  phrase “it’s 5 o’clock somewhere” took root right here in Austin.  Revelry aside, CES and SXSW mean business, and while there are dozens of  similarities between the two, there are numerous differences as well.   While the Vegas event features educational sessions, keynote speeches and  seminars, CES is primarily a technology and innovation trade show – the largest  trade show, in fact, in North America.  If CES is all about technology, SXSW is truly all things to all people.

		This year’s edition of annual music industry showcase SXSW kicks off in Austin, Texas this week and, while it’s primarily about the next generation of bands and artists, there’s loads of big names that’ll be making the news. Here’s 10 things that everyone’s bound to be talking about between guzzling margaritas and chowing down on BBQ. UPDATE: Jay Z and Kanye West also will perform together at SXSW on Wednesday March 12 Coldplay preview new material…
Recently, Chris Martin’s Coldplay dropped a surprise new track, ‘Midnight’. Produced by Jon Hopkins, it hints at a cooler, more electronic approach to their forthcoming new album, ‘Ghost Stories’, due for release on May 19. SXSW should be the first chance to hear more from that record; the band are playing an iTunes Festival gig out in Austin, which will be live-streamed across the world so even if you’re not in Texas, you don’t have to worry about missing out. … And so does Julian Casablancas
Last week, The Strokes frontman shared a video teaser for his new solo album. It prompted a few questions for us and, come next Saturday (March 15), he should be answering at least one or two. His new backing band The Voidz will likely join him, revealing their identities, while it seems inevitable he’ll play some fresh tracks in between material taken from his 2009 debut ‘Phrazes For The Young’. Lady Gaga is this year’s Keynote speaker
Dave Grohl, Bruce Springsteen and the late Lou Reed have all taken a break from playing music to speak at SXSW and, this year, Lady Gaga will join that list. We don’t know what she’ll talk about yet but, as one of music’s more eccentric characters, it’s bound to be interesting. The night before, the singer will perform an intimate gig at the Stubb’s venue. 
Meanwhile, Jarvis Cocker will be on hand to help out songwriters 
The Pulp frontman is one of the finest lyricists of modern British music and he’ll be offering songwriting tips at a SXSW lecture on Wednesday, using his own lyrics to show his development as a musician, explaining the “meaning of artistic vision” and giving advice to budding stars. Sounds like one lecture you’ll want to take notes at. Jungle will be a must-see band
Sure, we still don’t know what Jungle actually look like (think the pictures you’ve seen are actually them? Think again) but they’re shaping up to be one of the most talked about bands of the festival if the rabid reaction to their recent shows in the UK is anything to go by. The whole enigmatic schtick might be a bit tiresome these days but when you’ve got the tunes to back it up – just check out Jungle’s latest single ‘Busy Earnin’- you can almost get away with it. We’d suggest getting in the queue for their Austin shows now. Green Day’s side project will play 
The Californian punks formed their garage rock side project Foxboro Hot Tubs in 2007 and released their debut album ‘Stop Drop And Roll’ the following year. They played under the name at a secret show in Oakland, California last year and now they’ve promised to do a two hour set at SXSW. Expect songs from their one and only LP plus tracks from Green Day’s 2012 record, ‘¡Dos!’.

It’s been five years since the rapper released any music but he’s set to make his comeback this year with new record ‘Animal Ambition’, due June 3. What better place to preview his new tracks? 50 Cent should have plenty of material to choose from too – he’s also got another LP, ‘Street King Immortal’, done and dusted although he’s yet to confirm any concrete details about that record. Kelis’ food truck 
As well as playing a show at the festival, Kelis will be previewing her new album ‘Food’ by serving up dishes from her very own food truck during the event. On the menu, she’s promising jerk ribs (obviously), duck confit sliders, shredded beef and wild cherry BBQ sauce and coleslaw. Sadly, it doesn’t look like milkshake’s on the menu.Trick well and truly missed. Fat White Family take their riotous live show to the US for the first time
Another band bound to be causing a stir at SXSW is Radar Award winners Fat White Family. They had to sell their services to get themselves over the Atlantic (they raised money via PledgeMusic, offering massages, meals and private gigs in return for cash) so expect them to make that hard work worthwhile. Just how America will react to their sleazy, ramshackle punk remains to be seen but we’d bet our houses on them starting some sort of controversy. Music films screened for the first time
SXSW isn’t just about music – there’s film and technology portions to the festival too. Bands and cinema collide for some of it though, with some hotly anticipated music flicks showing in Austin. Festival-goers will be able to catch the premiere of ‘Pulp’, a documentary about Pulp, and A$AP Rocky’s SVDDXNLY film, while the long-delayed André 3000-starring Jimi Hendrix biopic All Is By My Side is also screening. <!–

584	"With some 2,200 acts performing at the annual South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas, the roster is too varied and too deep to serve as an indicator of where rock and pop is headed.  But it’s rich with clues.For example, SXSW says hip-hop is still a force.   Next-generation performers on tap include 20-year-old Chance the Rapper; Future, likely to showcase material from “Honest,” his next album; genre-smasher Jeremiah Jae; Gee Watts, whose debut album “199x” arrives in early April; 21-year-old Young Thug; and YG, whose debut full-length disk “My Krazy Life” is out next week.   As for hip-hop’s present:  Kendrick Lamar is headlining an iTunes-sponsored show that also features ScHoolboy Q and Isaiah Rashad.

586	"Mark Holden, head of futures at media agency Arena, reveals the lessons he has learned on the third day at SXSW Interactive in Austin, Texas.It’s busy here in Austin. Thirty thousand delegates have come together for SXSW Interactive 2014, and the breadth of sessions, topics and speakers is vast. In just one hour, Eric Schmidt will talk about the new digital age, alongside sessions about content and commerce, crowd-funded start-ups and music for video game marketing.It’s inspiring but also a bit of a sensory overload, as sessions about the ‘big’ trends in technology (e.g. crypto currencies, robots, genetics or connected objects) rub up against topics that marketers and agencies are grappling with now (e.g. retail, content, mobile). So, what, as a marketing community, should we take away from SXSW and put into practice? What ideas, themes, trends or technologies should we invest our time in? Here’s my take on how approach and prioritise the key areas I’ve seen emerge from SXSW Interactive this year:There are four topics I’ve seen across the schedule at SXSW this year which we are all grappling with now: mobile marketing, content, real-time communication and the evolution of social media for marketing. Perhaps surprisingly, the conversation around these topics has not focused on the new and shiny, but on how to approach them in more mature ways.For example, as the ‘mobile majority’ becomes a reality, Richard Ting of R/GA put forward a more strategic view of mobile marketing: not mobile screens as spaces for advertising, but planning for mobile to enhance product and user experiences, of which ads may be one part. This requires building mobile services and assets over the long-term (such as the excellent Nike Tricktree), not necessarily one-off ‘campaign hits’ for the sake of ticking a mobile box.Content and real-time marketing have been two of the most prolific topics here at SXSW. And the key questions are being tackled: should every brand ‘do’ real-time marketing? What’s the strategic value of content? A particularly highlight was Kristina Halvorson, of Brain Traffic, who accuses the marketing community of being ‘drunk’ on the buzz of agile and real-time content - the ""Oreo effect"".To whoops of support, she called on brands and agencies to focus their content efforts on serving customers at their points of real need, and to have clearly defined content strategies that focus on making content that really counts, not chasing every new opportunity that arises.In fact, putting customer experience first is a big theme across SXSW. On this count, the marketing community and the developer community have something in common:  to remember that we’re designing digital services for customers, not ourselves, and their needs are always paramount. Adobe’s ‘pipeline’ development team revealed how they build new products, and at the heart of their process is one key principle: that the customer experience of any prototype defines success or failure. We need to put customers (and their behaviours) first, and the technology second.Yes, there are plenty of sessions about wearable technology. But there is one underlying, and more significant, trend here at SXSW that will play out over the next 2 years: what the Internet looks and feels like when it moves beyond phones, tablets and computers.We are all familiar with responsive design. But in a session about next generation responsive, Sarah Rotman Epps of Forrester spoke compellingly about the need go beyond ‘responsive’ as a way to show webpages on 3 screens, to a new marketing design paradigm which cuts across any potential screen: digital signage, watches, in-car systems, connected TVs and others. When many more new screens are connected, design of marketing must be truly responsive: tailored to a customer need and the context they’re using a particular device in.In fact, contextual user experience is another recurring theme of SXSW 2014. Partly driven by data, partly by new connected ‘ things’, and partly of the ubiquity of Internet access, designing how services (and marketing) help users in a particularly context and moment of need, is going to be a big challenge moving forward. Cliff Kuang of Wired sums it up by calling for ‘more context, less complexity’. By understand what people are doing on their devices at any point in time or place, we should tailor brand experiences that make life a little easier for them.Staring into the distant future here at SXSW is exciting, and a little bit scary. The most fundamental trend I have seen is how technology reshapes manufacturing and our expectations of what products are. Ideo and Joi Ito of MIT Media Labs painted a picture of this potential new reality, where already in places like Shenzen, product designers are effectively ‘A/B testing’ physical products at scale by using advanced production and 3D-printing techniques.They predict that everyday products will be embedded with sensors, such that almost anything, including our clothes, may respond to our emotional need-states.  This points towards a future where mass customisation of products becomes a reality - where we expect the things we buy and use to respond to us. At this point, marketing really does meet user experience design.There is one common thread I have seen that cuts across the now, next and beyond of SXSW: whether its content, context or customisation, the place is to start is with the needs of customers (and users) and build messages, experiences and products that improve their lives, even if just a little bit.A new Campaign for a new breedNew ideas, new perspectives, new focusRegister for tailored email bulletins today and let us deliver the insight that you need

  A GROUP of pop and rock bands and two movies from Scotland are to appear this week at one of the world's most influential cultural festivals in the US.

  Meursault, Young Fathers, Prides, Withered Hand, Honeyblood, Casual Sex and Holy Esque will be at the South by South West (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas, as well as the films God Help the Girl and For Those in Peril.

  A special event, Showcasing Scotland, backed by the nation's art body, Creative Scotland, and the Association of Independent Music will take place on Friday.

  God Help the Girl and For Those In Peril will screen as part of The SXSW Film Conference & Festival.

  Paul Wright, the director of For Those in Peril, said: ""It's really exciting for us all to be part of this year's SXSW festival. We could not have picked a better place for the film to have its North American premiere than at a festival known for showcasing exciting new talent from around the world.""

  Bands are often spotted at the festival and signed by labels and agents, or improve their reputation within the US.

  David Weaver, development officer at Creative Scotland, said: ""The seven acts we are supporting really showcase the diversity in Scottish music right now.

  ""All of the bands are fantastic in different ways, both on record and live, and I'm really looking forward to seeing them perform in Austin. Each act is set for a great year ahead.""

  Following its recent world premiere at Sundance Film Festival and then at Berlin Film Festival, Stuart Murdoch's first feature film God Help the Girl is screening at the Paramount Theatre on Saturday.

  The film's co-producer Carole Sheridan, from Singer Films, said: ""SXSW is a cool festival and we are hopeful the film will be loved by the music and film fans that attend.""

592	"Clear.Clear skies. Low 19F. Winds light and variable. Updated: February 12, 2018 @ 4:15 pmÂ Â The students, led by media arts and studies lecturer Josh Antonuccio, will get the chance to attend exclusive conferences, interviews and mentor sessions with many of the movers and shakers of the music industry. They'll also have complete access to thousands of live shows on more than 100 stages across the city, performed by popular and rising musical talents alike.""OU students will be on the cutting edge of what's changing and happening in the music industry right now,"" Antonuccio said. ""It's a six-month preview of what's coming down the pipes, culturally.""The experience is all part of Antonuccio's Media 4903 SXSW class. It's the first year for the class at OU - Antonuccio taught a similar class at Hocking College in 2009, where he performed with folk singer-songwriter Emily Rodger's band. He said this will be his sixth year of attending the SXSW music festival. SXSW, also known as ""South-By,"" includes interactive and film festivals, as well.Antonuccio said the conferences and interviews provide unmatched opportunities for students.""The atmosphere is electrified with culture and creativity, and there are so many great entrepreneurial ideas,"" he said.Among the more exciting features for the OU class are interviews with musician Jarvis Cocker from indie rock outfit Pulp and singer-songwriter CeeLo Green, as well as a panel discussion on the future of YouTube music revenue models led by Russell Simmons, co-founder of legendary rap music label Def Jam.""Music supervision, live music - all of the people that are running those companies, they (students) can literally just go up and talk to them,"" Antonuccio said.Junior audio production student Colin Cottrell said that students had the ability to pick and choose which discussion sessions, presentations and bands they wanted to go see outside of a few required events per day.""I think I'm most excited to see Neil Young and Sean Combs speak,"" he said. ""As for bands, After the Burial and Animals as Leaders are both playing Friday night, and I really look forward to that.""He said the students' full-badge access at SXSW provides a ""great learning and networking opportunity for people involved with music"" with countless members of the music industry - a definite boon as students prepare to enter the marketplace.Antonuccio said some of the conference sessions often last until late into the night, but that performances happen constantly throughout Austin from Tuesday through Sunday, March 11-16, while the students will be in Austin. More informal performance showcases - some free, some not - span the daylight hours, and then regular performance lineups take place in the evenings at the various venues. Antonuccio recalled walking home once at 2 a.m. after a full day of performances and interviews, hearing a familiar riff nearby, walking into a venue, and discovering that big-time alternative rock act Smashing Pumpkins was playing a free show for a crowd of around 1,000 people.Austin has a diverse mix of venues - from Athens-esque backyard shows to concert halls to bars where the likes of R&B singer Janelle Monae and party animal Andrew W.K. show their chops in an intimate environment. Crowds could be as small as 100 or as big as 30,000.The only downside, really, is the risk of not getting into a particular crowded venue. The festival has grown substantially in recent years, so it's not unusual to get closed out of a show by a performer or band that's been getting a lot of festival buzz.On the other hand, according to Antonuccio, ""It's one of the coolest cities on the planet, and the BBQ's amazing, and there's a live music venue every five feet.""Antonuccio said SXSW is also a great place to discover new talent. Mainstream bands perform alongside lesser-known acts. He said he's excited to support visiting Ohio bands, including Athens' own folk-rock act The Ridges.Through the class's $800 course fee, the students' lodging, plane ticket and music festival pass are all paid for; the pass (which regularly costs about $600 or more) functioning as a kind of ""golden ticket"" that allows them to jump to the front of any lines for musical acts, and gives them exclusive access rights to festival sessions and interviews.Once the students get back, Antonuccio said, they will present their experiences in two roundtable discussions with OU student and faculty members. The class is already cleared for next year's SXSW - although students should be aware that it involves a selective application process.SXSW runs from March 7-16 (with the Interactive festival running March 7-11, Film running March 7-15, and Music running March 11-16).

If you think you can just fit in at SXSW Interactive, you are wrong. Unless you normally only wear plain clothing with things like “Wordpress” or “Google” written across them, clear framed glasses and leather boots, you will stand out like a hipster in a Microsoft store. Really the only thing you can do to prepare yourself for the SXSW Interactive experience is practice your buzzwords. This way you can at least communicate with everyone else around you in the Austin Convention Center. This is a list of the five words you need to know before leaving your apartment to go mingle with the #TechNerds downtown.1. Disrupt, verb: interrupt by causing a disturbance or problem
SXSWi definition: new technology that unexpectedly displaces an already established technology
Sentence: “Man, online video is one disruptive technology that really changed the whole television game, bro, man.”If you don’t know this one, go home. Really, go home. It is apparently the most important word in the TechBro language. If we’re lucky, one of the dudes with spiky hair trying to find a cute little TechBabe to settle down with will invent the next form of disruptive technology soon. Personally, I hope it has something to do with pants that can produce identification cards when you lose yours downtown during SXSW.
SXSWi panel: Disruption of TV and the Future of “Online” Video2. Wearable, adjective: able to be worn
SXSWi definition: some piece of technology that can be worn as clothing
Sentence: “This wearable is great for making calls but totally makes my wrist look fat.”The Google Glassholes are only the beginning. From what I’ve heard walking around the Convention Center, there are big things coming the world of technological things you can wear on your actual body. Even Mindy Kaling is in on it — she talked about owning a calorie counter that can be worn on your bra. 
SXSWi panel: Wearable Devices: The Future of Healthcare?3. Platform, noun: a raised surface on which things or people can stand
SXSWi definition: some public service through which you can spread your personal brand
Sentence: “I used to love Facebook, but now Twitter is definitely my favorite platform.”If you haven’t heard of platforms by now, you’re doing it wrong. How are you even ON the Internet at all? You probably don’t even have a ***Brand*** (see below).
SXSWi panel: Platforms vs. Publishers: A Big New Theory4. Brand, noun: a product made by a certain company under a certain name
SXSWi definition: a person or company’s personality, essentially, presented in a marketable way
Sentence: “I don’t know, I just don’t think eating seven Cronuts in a row fits my Brand.”If I’ve learned anything in three days of SXSW panels, it’s that you are nothing without your Brand. I’m in the process of figuring mine out, so you could say my Brand is “just trying to figure out my Brand.”
SXSWi panel: Life’s a Breach, Don’t Burn Your Brand5. Startup, verb: the process of setting something in motion
SXSWi definition: a small, decently innovative company made up of mostly 20-somethings who don’t need real jobs
Sentence: “I was in a pretty good startup at last year’s SXSW, but we kind of ended a few weeks after the festival.”In a few years, SXSW might start requiring all attendees to be a part of some kind of startup. That might actually be a requirement now and I’m just missing out. There hasn’t been a single day I haven’t heard someone mention their startup. The strange thing is, none of them seem to exist anymore. Hmm.

596	"We proudly present this article from our partners at ReadWrite.By Taylor HatmakerNothing can inspire such a volatile cocktail of dread and excitement in an otherwise-technology-loving human quite like South by Southwest.South by Southwest Interactive — SXSWi to acronym-loving geeks — is tech’s premier celebration of itself. It takes place annually in a very much transformed Austin, TX. Like our other not-quite-sane-enough-to-skip-it peers, we'll be making the trek down to South By (first tip: that’s what you call it) later this week.Whether it’s your first time or your tenth, being ready is your key to making it out alive.And not just alive, but enlivened by awesome networking, excellent tacos, and a ton of learning from great minds throughout the industry — if you play your cards right.(Note: it’s ever so hip to hate on major tech events right now, but really, SXSW is a great time. We’re a little jaded, and it’s exhausting, but hey, we still love the heck out of all things technology.)If you're reading this, it's time to book a hotel for SXSW 2015. Hell, it might be time to book for next next year's. Ironically, at one of the world's most tech-savvy gatherings, basic logistics like finding a place to sleep and getting from point A to point B can prove totally maddening.That said, if you're a risk-taker, you can rock it last minute, taking advantage of careful planners who booked rooms just in case and decided to cancel. HotelTonight's app may give you an edge in snapping up these last-minute rooms. Just be aware you may end up staying in San Antonio.Austin is both a small city and a big one. If you're staying downtown, walking your ass off is honestly the best way to get around. You'll see bikers driving ""pedicabs"" around — don’t use those. They're silly, slow, and expensive.For the interactive portion of South By, nearly all events are walkable once you're in the Austin Convention Center area. Just allow extra time for crowds, traffic, and elaborate social marketing stunts you might run into on the way. As an alternative, look for free promotional rides (car brands like Chevy tend to do this) and special deals on social transportation apps.Bike share programs near the convention center and Craigslist bike rentals are also an option, but be careful — and wear a damn helmet. That Ford F-150 may not know how to share the road.Above all, be flexible. Even with an impeccably planned SXSW itinerary, you'll find that it's a chaotic, bustling jam-packed event, so be open to going with the flow. There's so much to see and do, it's impossible to do it all. You can't do 1/5000th of it all. Focus on picking a small handful of talks, sessions, and keynotes that really resonate with you and rely on serendipity for the rest. And vet your picks a little — the quality of SXSW sessions can be very uneven.The official SXSW schedule maker tends to be pretty good for updated location info and the like, but there's no shame in sitting down and highlighting the little conference booklet they give you. No matter what, be sure to cross-reference times and locations, as they often change. Suggested Survival Apps: Official SXSW GO App (schedule planning and info), Zipcar and Car2Go (both require prior membership), Ridescout (transportation aggregator), and GroupMe (reliable group messaging).Surviving SXSW requires an internal Zen-like state, but you can give yourself a winning edge with gadgets. The biggest nonpsychological struggle at South By is that Austin's wireless networks, much like any network invaded by 50,000 power users at once, are completely choked for the whole week. Anticipate having spotty mobile service or none whatsoever, and plan accordingly.Remember life before cell phones, when we set times and places to meet friends and co-workers in advance? Go retro and do that. Hop on WiFi whenever you can find it: SXSW is doubling its bandwidth for this year’s event.Bringing a mobile router like a MiFi or adding a mobile hotspot to your smartphone plan won't hurt. Pro tip: use a different carrier for your MiFi than your phone, so if one network fails, you've got another option.With all that fighting for a signal, your devices will die faster than you knew was even possible. Battery life takes a huge hit at events like this, so bring a mobile battery pack to make it through the long days (and nights). At ReadWrite, we like Enercell’s Power Banks for a little emergency battery boost and Mophie's excellent portable Powerstations when you need to breathe serious battery life into multiple gadgets. Beyond those essentials, pack light. If you can get away with bringing a tablet and a Bluetooth keyboard rather than that hefty 17-inch MacBook, your back will thank you. If you're carrying a camera, lighter models like a Sony A7R, Sony RX100, or other compact shooters are preferable to a heavy full-fledged DSLR.And hey, if you’ve got Google Glass, this might be one of your best opportunities to wear it in a sort of socially acceptable setting — just stash it away before you start getting your happy hour on.This one is harder than it sounds. Even if you know what to expect at SXSW, you'll feel like a kid in a technological candy shop when you're in the thick of it. It's harder than it sounds to remember the basic stuff that'll keep you in the game. There are one million parties, happy hours, and open bars, but you'll be happier indulging in moderation and getting a good night's sleep than drinking other attendees under the table. Remember: nothing — I repeat, nothing — in this world is more hellish than a SXSW hangover.While you're there, balance out the social media and tech frenzy with a little music. It is a music festival, too, after all. SXSW has plenty of good shows mixed into its events, so be sure to catch a few. And if you get a chance to hang out in Austin a little longer, skip down to South Congress for chill vibes at the Austinite's unofficial version of the SXSW music festival, South by San Jose. Just don't tell the locals I sent you.Most important of all, eat regular meals, drink a ton of water (it's Texas!), and set aside small chunks of quiet time to sit back and take it all in. Good luck out there.Related Links

I continue to see all the guys from High School... It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience. It brings you right back to those days.""Zac and his former girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale and Corbin Bleu shot to fame as the plucky high school students in the hugely successful trilogy, which ran from 2006 to 2008.Maybe Zac wants a return to a simpler time after a tough 2013, which saw him enter rehab for unknown substance issues and break his jaw in a nasty spill at his L.A. home.Since his breakthrough role, the actor has appeared in gritty drama The Paperboy, The Lucky One, and new comedy That Awkward Moment.High School Musical's first two instalments were made as TV movies, but the third film was given a theatrical release due to high demand, grossing £158 million worldwide on a £6.8 million budget."

He said he was ""100 percent"" on doing the project and that he and the other actors involved in the three HSM films were ""all thinking about"".And since, Rogen was there, he suggested that an R-rated version of the Disney film would be interesting to watch.But, like seeing old high school classmates, Efron said he and his former cast mates share a special bond because of the years they worked together. He said, ""I continue to see all the guys from 'High School'. Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience...It just brings you right back to those days.""""High School Musical"" first premiered in 2006 on the Disney Channel as a film-made-for-TV, CBS News reported. It was the network's most successful TV-movie project of all time; and in the same year, the film's soundtrack became the highest-selling album.On the following year, a sequel was released following the same TV-movie format. In 2008, a theatrical film, the ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"" was released and grossed $50 million in North America and $40 million overseas during its third opening day.After the ""High School Musical"" trilogy, Efron had a flourishing career and starred in films like ""17 Again"", ""Charlie St. Cloud"", ""The Lucky One"", ""Parkland"" and ""That Awkward Moment"".In his latest film, ""Neighbors"", he plays a fraternity president who is the source of his next-door neighbor's problems. In an article on E! Online, he shared his experiences in filming the raunchy scenes for the comedy film. ""It was neat,"" he said, ""For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama.

Fans have spent the past six years desperately waiting to see where the story will go next — and in a recent interview, Efron confirmed that a High School Musical reunion might be on the horizon.""We're all thinking about [doing another High School Musical movie],"" said Efron. ""I continue to to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do... there's just this look between us."" That look, presumably, is the smirk on the faces of a bunch of 20-somethings who can make a ton of easy money by cashing in on the nostalgia of a bunch of rapidly aging tweens. Keep your fingers crossed, HSM fans: We're all in this together! Scott MeslowZac Efron threatens to make another High School MusicalSarah Huckabee Sanders insists Trump 'supports victims of domestic violence' and believes in 'due process'On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders addressed the controversy surrounding Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary accused of domestic violence. Porter resigned last Wednesday after the allegations against him were detailed by his two ex-wives to the Daily Mail and The Intercept. The White House initially defended him against the reports, only to backtrack once The Intercept published graphic photos of one of the women with a black eye — images Porter admitted taking.In the aftermath of the allegations and Porter's departure, President Trump himself reminded reporters Friday that Porter ""says he's innocent."" He also tweeted Saturday that ""lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.""Reading from prepared remarks Monday, Sanders insisted that Trump ""supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone deserves to be treated fairly and with due process."" The press corps was not placated that easily, as ABC News' Cecilia Vega asked why Trump hadn't made any statement supporting the victims. ""Why doesn't the president say exactly what you just said right there?"" Vega asked. Sanders maintained that she was ""relaying"" Trump's words as dictated to her.Vega pressed Sanders, asking, ""Does [Trump] believe Rob Porter's accusers, or are they lying?"" Sanders repeated that ""the president … [takes] domestic violence very seriously"" and is also a firm believer in ""due process."" When Vega pointed out that Sanders hadn't answered her question, Sanders replied, ""I'm not going to go beyond that.""Watch the exchange below. Kelly O'Meara MoralesOn whether Pres.

Watch the full trailer below. Shivani IshwarCount Olaf is in charge of the marketing for A Series of Unfortunate Events nowFormer MLB All-Star arrested after police find more than 40 pounds of 'suspected cocaine' at his houseFormer MLB All-Star Esteban Loaiza was arrested last week in San Diego, California, after authorities found major amounts of drugs in his possession, USA Today reports. The bust began after Loaiza was pulled over for a ""minor traffic infraction"" while driving ""a vehicle that police believed was being used to smuggle drugs,"" USA Today explains.In a press release, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Loaiza was arrested as part of an ""ongoing narcotics investigation."" After stopping Loaiza, police searched his vehicle and realized it had ""sophisticated"" modifications that seemed to exist for the purpose of hiding drugs. From there, police were able to obtain a warrant to search his home, where they found more than 40 pounds of suspected drugs worth about $500,000, authorities said.San Diego police said the substance is ""suspected cocaine,"" but the final identification is pending further testing, USA Today reports. Loaiza pitched for various teams in his 14-year MLB career, making more than $40 million as a member of several clubs including the New York Yankees, the Texas Rangers, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was twice named an All-Star. Police are currently holding him on felony charges for possession of heroin and cocaine as well as ""possession and transportation of narcotics for sale,"" ESPN says. His bail is reportedly set at $200,000. Kelly O'Meara MoralesFormer MLB All-Star arrested after police find more than 40 pounds of 'suspected cocaine' at his houseTrump compares rebuilding U.S. infrastructure to building an ice skating rink in Central ParkLife is like a box of chocolates, and rebuilding American infrastructure is akin to erecting an ice skating rink. So claimed President Trump on Monday, speaking to reporters on the heels of his administration's unveiling of its long-delayed and much-hyped infrastructure plan.The 55-page plan calls for a $1.5 trillion investment to improve freeways, bridges, and water resources across the U.S. — just $200 billion of which would come from the federal government. The rest would ostensibly be provided by private or local matches.Speaking to reporters about the wonders of collaboration, Trump compared the task of improving the country's infrastructure to the time he built an ice skating rink in Central Park. ""We're gonna have a lot of great people working. We're gonna also have great companies investing and building, and they'll build for you,"" Trump said, ""because sometimes the states aren't able to [build] like [the federal government] can … or like I used to do it when I did the Wollman Rink.""In the 1980s, Trump helped renovate the Wollman Rink, a process that had been stalled for years before he stepped in. ""They couldn't get it built, and I did it in a few months at a much smaller price,"" he said. Trump said he'd been reminded of the rink ""the other day"" by someone who ""had never forgotten it"" and insisted that the rink's expedited construction ""remains a big deal."" He concluded: ""It's really no different with a roadway ... it's no different with a bridge or tunnel or any of the things we'll be fixing.""To the president's credit, he did indeed finish the construction on the Wollman Rink under budget and quicker than expected. Trump came in ""about $750,000"" under the $3 million budget allotted for the project, The New York Times reported at the time, for a rough total investment of $2,250,000 — or, in other words, significantly less than 1 percent of the budget for Trump's infrastructure plan. Kelly O'Meara MoralesTrump compares rebuilding U.S. infrastructure to building an ice skating rink in Central ParkFor the past 6 months, a former top FBI agent has reportedly been working to verify the Trump dossier for BuzzFeedA former top FBI cybersecurity official has been traveling the world over the past six months in an effort to confirm aspects of the controversial dossier on President Trump for BuzzFeed News, Foreign Policy reports. Anthony Ferrante now works for FTI Consulting, which was reportedly hired by BuzzFeed's lawyers after the publication was sued by Russian billionaire Aleksej Gubarev for libel. ""If it's fact, it's not libel. That's the idea,"" said one person familiar with the decision by BuzzFeed's attorneys.Gubarev is mentioned in the dossier, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, which BuzzFeed published in January 2017. The dossier has come under intense scrutiny due to its role in the FBI's obtaining a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The dossier, which began as Republican opposition research before later being funded by actors connected to Hillary Clinton, alleges a number of Trump campaign associates corresponded or met with Russian officials about dropping sanctions against Moscow if Trump won the election. It additionally alleges that Russia has compromising information on Trump that could be used to blackmail him.""At FTI, Ferrante launched what's now been a months-long stealth effort chasing down documents and conducting interviews on the ground in various countries around the world,"" Foreign Policy reports. ""His team directed BuzzFeed lawyers to subpoena specific data and testimony from dozens of agencies or companies across the country and assembled a cyber ops war room to analyze that data, according to sources familiar with the work.""Ferrante worked at the FBI from 2005 through April 2017, and was involved in the U.S. response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Sheriffs are a ""critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement,"" Sessions said — phrasing that was not included in a transcript of the prepared remarks. He added: ""We must never erode this historic office.""""The office of Sheriff is a critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement.

The phrase ""Anglo-American"" typically refers to Americans of English ethnic heritage, or whose native language is English, who are often white.The Hill explains that the etymology of the word ""sheriff"" can be traced to Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, which is perhaps what the attorney general was referring to. But this isn't the first time Sessions has invoked ""Anglo-American"" values: Vice News' Tess Owen pointed out that only two weeks ago, Sessions referred to late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia as ""one of the best judges in American history, and maybe even the Anglo-American tradition."" Kelly O'Meara MoralesJeff Sessions praises sheriffs as a 'critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement'The military has added thousands of names to the FBI's firearms background check list after the Texas massacreThe military quietly added the names of more than 4,000 dishonorably discharged military personnel to the FBI's background check system after a former Air Force member killed 26 people at a Texas church in November, CNN reports. Devin Patrick Kelley, the 26-year-old shooter, had not been entered into a national database by the Air Force after receiving a bad-conduct discharge for assaulting his wife; if his name had been in the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database, he would have been prohibited from purchasing firearms.After the November attack, the Department of Defense rushed to make sure the FBI's system was up to date. CNN found that the backlog was ""so significant that the FBI's tally of dishonorably discharged former service members has ballooned by 4,284 names in just three months, a 38 percent leap."" In 2015, the number of people blocked from owning firearms due to being dishonorably discharged was around 11,000. After November, that bloomed to where it is today, at 15,597.Still, the database is not perfect, and it only blocks sales through licensed dealers. Purchases from neighbors, for example, do not require a background check, CNN notes. Nevertheless, ""the background check system has blocked over three million illegal attempts to buy guns,"" said the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Avery W. Gardiner. ""But a database is only as good as the data in it.""  Jeva LangeThe military has added thousands of names to the FBI's firearms background check list after the Texas massacre"	Entertainment
605	"AUSTIN – Move over Animal House, Seth Rogen and Zac Efron are staking claim to the top of the frat-boy party movie class.They star in Neighbors, a raunchily entertaining comedy that pits Rogen as Mac, a  young thirtysomething husband and father, against Teddy (Efron), the president of a hard-partying fraternity that moves in next door.Even though the film with a May 9 release date is not completely finished, director Nicholas Stoller wanted to bring the film to the South By Southwest festival Saturday night. When he brought Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Austin in 2008 ""it was the best screening I've ever been at,"" Stoller told the audience before the film played.Writer-executive producer Brendan O'Brien got the idea for the script when his wife called the police because some college kids who were being a nuisance next door. ""That is kind of the idea of where this actually came from,"" Rogen said on the red carpet before the film was screened. ""If you actually had to live next to that and you were someone who was trying to have some responsibility in their life it would just be a disaster. That idea was just really funny to us.""At first, Mac and wife Kelly, played by Rose Byrne (The Internship) try to welcome the fraternity into the neighbor, even joining in on the festivities. But eventually the constant clamor derails their baby's sleep schedule and have to fight back.There are plenty of homages to Animal House. An almost unrecognizable Lisa Kudrow plays the school dean, who like Dean Wormer (John Vernon) in the 1978 film, calls in the fraternity's leaders to put them on probation. And there's hazing of pledges, too, but here it gets a Google Glass-style twist. ""Everybody in comedy loves that movie on some level,"" said co-producer James Weaver.But these Deltas go to new lengths to save their frat house. After Mac breaks a water pipe and floods the building's basement, the Deltas get creative in fund-raising and offer up a suggestive new use for 3-D printers.Rogen (Pineapple Express) and Efron (That Awkward Moment) graduate to new roles in the film. As Mac, Rogen ""is the adult person in this relationship,"" Weaver said.The former High School Musical star shows off his buff body and breaks new ground in other ways, too. ""Let's just say he uses a lot of four-letter words,"" said Evan Goldberg, who last year formed Point Grey Pictures with Rogen and Weaver.Efron can still create a clamor of his own; shrieks of glee were heard upon his arrival at the Paramount theater before the screening. He gushed about Austin as a festival destination.""There is an energy, man, a vibe about the town. People here really love movies and you just feel such support,"" Efron said. ""And the fellow artists you meet around town, casually, it's integrated with the people. Usually it's so separate,. Here I really feel like we're part of the world. It's really neat.""When asked by an audience member if he was happy where his career has taken him, Efron said, ""this was awesome. It couldn't be better. When you get a call from Seth Rogen, you are in a pretty good place.""No release date was announced. Neighbors needs ""a few trims and it's not mixed,"" Stoller told the crowd afterwards.The almost-psychedelic party scenes will sound even better properly mixed, said Stoller who recommended viewers see the final cut. ""It will be dramatically different when you pay for it,"" Rogen riffed.""And it's in 3-D,"" Stoller joked."	Entertainment

	Unlike some stars who shun what it is that made them famous, Zac Efron said he would welcome a reunion film for the High School Musical cast.
	""I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience,"" Efron said while at South by Southwest, promoting his current film Neighbors.
	When asked if he’d return, he didn’t hesitate to answer. “100 percent!”
	The first High School Musical movie became the Disney Channel’s most successful made-for-TV movie ever and also starred Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Hudgens. The album was even the highest selling record of the entire year of 2006.
	The sequel, High School Musical 2, aired on TV and also broke records. But, the gang hit the big screen for High School Musical 3, which went on to make $252.9 million. Sounds like a film that could use a follow-up.
	Catch up with the gang and watch High School Musical 3 online.

Zac Efron admitted recently that he would be “100 percent” on board for a High School Musical reunion movie. While promoting his film Neighbors, with Seth Rogen, the 26-year-old indicated, in an interview with E! News at SXSW, would be interesting in returning to his character of Troy Bolton, “We’re all thinking about it,” Efron said. “I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do…there’s just this look between us. It’s so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.”Rogen was present at the interview and joked that the film should be a “really dirty, R-rated ‘High School Musical’ movie,” reports ABC News.Despite the apparent interest from the That Awkward Moment star, there are no known plans for a reunion movie and it’s only been six years since the last High School Musical film. Efron can next be seen in Neighbors, which stars Rogen and Rose Byrne, as his wife, on May 9. The film follows Rogen’s family as they find themselves having to endure living right next door to a fraternity house, where Efron and Dave Franco reside.image courtesy of Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic/Image.netComments are closed

News: ‘We’re all thinking about it.‘I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do…there’s just this look between us.‘It’s so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.‘[As soon as I see them] it brings you right back to those days.’Of course it might be slightly more awkward this time around seeing as he broke up with his on-screen girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens, who played Gabriella Montez, in 2010 after three years of dating.The first of the three films came out in 2006.

616	"In a recent interview with E! News, Zac Efron said that another High School Musical movie isn't out of the question. (Disney's previous plans for the series to continue with new, rival high schools and an all-new cast never panned out.) ""We're all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School, he said. ""Every time we do... there's just this look between us."" Obviously, the script for High School Musical 4: Reunion writes itself, so here are some quick character summaries:Troy Bolton developed an addiction to painkillers after a knee injury derailed his basketball career — only the gift of upbeat song can set him back on the road to recovery/clean, musical living. He and Gabriela broke up because she put academics before true love; she's cured cancer already, but she's still insufferable — and refuses to take her lab coat off even for the dance numbers. Gabriela's best friend Taylor is also insufferable, mostly because she never left East High where she now takes out her frustrations on students in the athletic decathlon team she still runs as a teacher. Despite what Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure may have suggested, everyone's secret favorite Sharpay Evans' career showbiz career never really took off — but she did appear on a recent season of The Bachelor. (Note: this allows for a cameo appearance from real-life Bachelor crazies like Erica Rose from that season with Prince Lorenzo.) She doesn't speak to her twin brother Ryan any more because he's big into the gay party circuit and so is basically never not at the gym. Corbin Bleu's character Chad is also really buff now, but that's about all the character development he'll get. And Troy Bolton is buff too, despite the pill-popping, did I mention that? REALLY BUFF:Anyway, aside from that the most important thing is that this GIF will be recreated in a pivotal scene: Now let's all go watch ""We're All In This Together"" on YouTube please.Follow Alex on Twitter.Photo credit: courtesy of Disney"	Entertainment

He's back! Zac revealed he would jump at the chance to reprise the role of Troy Bolton in a new HSM movie However, Zac has other things on his mind right now as he prepares for the release of his new movie Neighbors. The flick stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as a young couple with a baby whose lives are made difficult thanks to the hard partying fraternity next door. Zac plays a member of the frat and loved working on the comedy. Thinking about it: Zac says he and the cast inclduing Lucas Grabeel, Monique Coleman, Corbin Bleu, Ashley Tisdale,  and Vanessa Hudgens are still close and considering a new HSM movie He said: 'It was neat. For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.'For us, we really had a fraternity.'We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was.

 Tim Falkenberg March 10th, 2014 - 11:20 AM Several months ago now, our Weekly Trailer Roundup was topped by a pair of R-comedies headlined by Zac Efron: That Awkward Moment and Neighbors. To me, they both had potential. The trailers did their job. I was excited for the movies. Then I actually saw That Awkward Moment, and “excited” is about the last thing I felt. Fairly or not, my excitement for Neighbors was seriously tempered (Efron is the only connective tissue betwee the two pics, but I didn’t think he was great in Moment).That’ll teach me to whimsically equate unrelated productions.To a sold out crowd, Neighbors made its premier Saturday night at SXSW, and it wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration to say it had us literally rolling in the aisles. It’s no exaggeration to say this is one of the funniest and freshest R-comedies since The Hangover. Now if they can just avoid the impulse to serialize it to death.The story follows two threads: Seth Rogen and Rose Byre as a couple with a new baby trying to come to terms with the realities of responsible adulthood, and a frat cohort led by Zac Efron and Dave Franco trying to make fraternity history by doing something epic, something on the level of say, inventing beer pong…and just maybe trying to cope with the impending conclusion of college as well. After burning a prior house down, the frat moves in next door to Teddy and Kelly (Rogen and Byrne), and through a series of events that I won’t go into here (but are pretty damn funny to watch), the two households begin an epic feud.If that all sounds a little crazy, it’s because it is. But the movie absolutely nails the tone it’s trying for, consistently asking the audience not to suspend their disbelief entirely, but only to push the bounds of believable out a little ways. It’s what allows the movie to isolate Teddy and Kelly from the rest of the neighborhood by saying the frat bought out the rest of the block, but Teddy and Kelly can’t move because, being next to a frat, their home value has now plummeted. This is where the real fun of the movie is found. It gives itself license to do just about anything, but restrains itself just enough that the audience isn’t pulled in too many directions. It’s a lot like The Hangover, actually, by way of Home Alone. You want to believe all the craziness these characters do, and so it flies.
A big part of that is the way the characters themselves are drawn. As the old adage goes, keep it simple, stupid, and although I never thought I’d celebrate character arcs so skinny they’re practically anorexic, it’s exactly that this movie calls for. What sets it apart is that is that it doesn’t forsake its characters. Rogen is the formerly partying everyman he plays so well, taken to a new high here when he’s forced to couple that with actual responsibility for a wife and child. Byrne’s Kelly is a woman struggling to stay sane while staying home all day. Efron is the king who knows his reign must end. And Franco is the sidekick who points him the way. There’s not very much, but the way little bits of personality are sprinkled throughout the film contributes the grounding that the picture has. But those are also easy character arcs to complete. The most heavy-handed it gets is Efron confronting his own college mortality, and even that gets broken up by an amazing series of bros before hoes jokes.Because really, that’s what we want from this movie – jokes – and thank goodness the script and the actors are good enough to give us an abundance of hilarity. Rogen, of course, is a known comic quantity, but Efron proves very capable and Franco fits his sidekick role well, although it does seem like some of the awkwardness of his character is less acting and more pure awkwardness. Byrne gets a chance to leave behind the stuck up nature of her character in Bridesmaids, and absolutely owns it as the desperate-for-a-party Kelly. And finally, a discussion of the cast cannot conclude without mentioning the sublime comic supporting turn of Ike Bairnholtz as Teddy’s friend from work, as well as an all-too-brief performance from Lisa Kudrow.The Verdict: 4 out of 5This review has ended up somewhat shorter than normal, but that’s because there’s a very limited amount to say. This movie knows what it is: an R-comedy the vein of Knocked Up, Superbad, The Hangover, etc., but it’s smart enough to remain engaging and well executed to a high degree. My patience for this kind of film can be limited, but Neighbors knows what it’s doing. It doesn’t outstay its welcome, it’s hilarious throughout, and it has all the character development it needs without an ounce more. Your enjoyment of this film is going to be entirely contingent on your enjoyment of others of its kind, as it is directly out of the Apatow circle of influence, but rest assured – this is among the better films this subgenre has to offer.For more on Neighbors, check out our impressions from the SXSW World Debut.Tim Falkenberg[READ FULL BIO]

630	"Zac Efron is ''thinking about'' a 'High School Musical' reunion movie.

The 26-year-old actor was catapulted to the spotlight in 2006's hit film where he played popular student and captain of the varsity basketball team, Troy Bolton, alongside Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale.

The hunk claims he still meets up with his former co-stars, who've never forgotten the experience they shared, and insists their reunions take them back to the days when they worked together.

He told E! News: ''We're all thinking about it [reunion movie].

''I continue to see all the guys from 'High School'.

''Every time we do [meet up]... there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience. It brings you right back to those days.''

Efron will next hit the big screen in comedy 'Neighbors', where he plays the president of a fraternity, alongside Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne who have been cast as a married couple.

He added: ''It was neat. For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.

''For us, we really had a fraternity. We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun.''Prospera Place, KelownaMar 6 7:00 pmProspera Place, KelownaMar 7 7:00 pmProspera Place, KelownaMar 8 8:00 pm"	Entertainment

632	Are you ready to get your head back in the game?Zac Efron might be. Over the weekend, a reporter for E! asked the actor if he would ever return to the sacred (?) halls of East High — home of Disney’s High School Musical franchise. And instead of shooting down the rumors, Efron replied, “We’re all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do…there’s just this look between us.”Right off the bat, I’ll acknowledge that while this isn’t a “no,” it’s also not confirmation of a reunion. But also: At this point, would a reunion be the worst idea? It’s not exactly surprising that Efron may be in, even though a year or two ago he wanted to graduate from East High for good. (UPDATE: When EW asked Disney Channel for a response to Efron’s comments, they sent this statement: “Everyone at Disney Channel takes pride in knowing that our wonderful ‘High School Musical’ cast has fond memories about their days as ‘Wildcats,’ and that each year, new audiences are introduced to the movies through our telecasts around the world, but we have no ‘new news’ to report.”)If Efron did decide to return and give us “Scream Pt. 2,” it’s easy to see the rest of the cast following suit. They wouldn’t even have to carry a full movie: For a long time, Disney was developing a fourth High School Musical for TV. (And no, I’m not talking about SNL‘s High School Musical: New Senior Class.) The movie, called High School Musical: East Meets West, supposedly would have starred a new cast, and would have told a West Side Story-esque story about East and West High. (Real talk: What was Troy and Gabrielle’s love if not a millennial, significantly less high-stakes version of Maria and Tony?) The project keeps getting pushed back, but it hasn’t been canceled — Disney just put out Teen Beach Movie instead. But what if it got revved up again — and the original HSM gang came back for a little alumni number? (Efron has long said he would consider doing something like that.)A return from the original six could give HSM4 enough buzz for the movie to get off the ground. After all, Efron — while clearly the star of the bunch — has seen his last couple projects disappoint (RIP, That Awkward Moment). And while he’ll still have no trouble booking future films, it could be in Efron’s best interest to remind people why they love him in the first place. Specifically, I’m talking about this:Was this whole post of hypothetical teen movie hype just an excuse to embed the video above, so you can start your week off right? Bet on it.	Entertainment
633	"AUSTIN — To premiere at SXSW, Universal’s “Neighbors” decided to forgo the end credits, a final mix, and the aspect ratio correction, but the sold-out crowd at the Paramount Theater didn’t seem to mind. The Seth Rogen-produced raunchy comedy starring Zac Efron, Rose Byrne, Dave Franco and an often-shirtless Rogen debuted to an audience content to heartily laugh.While the weather outside was both frightful and wet, inside Rogen half joked that the only person out of the near dozen onstage that attended college was producer James Weaver, who also doubled as the sole member of a fraternity.The film follows the Radnor family (Rogen and Byrne), who, after having their first child experience the unfortunate circumstance of having a fraternity move in next door (its president is played by Efron). In an attempt to both give their daughter a peaceful environment and yet prove to themselves that they are still cool and hip, the duo walk a fine line, both partying with and calling the cops on the frat. Things inevitably escalate into a frat-versus-new parent war.






Director Nicholas Stoller deadpanned to the SXSW crowd that he used Gaspar Noe’s “Enter the Void” as visual inspiration (“but just a visual touchstone, not for anything else,” he said) and the audience heartily clapped when Rogen said he drew his inspiration for a series of car airbag pranks from hours of YouTube videos.

“There is a zero percent survival rate and we thought it was so funny we put it in the movie 17 times, but don’t do it to your friends,” Rogen warned the audience.After the film, “Neighbors” branded buses navigated through the rain to the “frat house,” a small space on the outskirts of downtown Austin that mixed ping pong balls, beer cozies and mud with live performances and brisket or soy tacos.“We will take it back to college tonight,” Efron told the crowd prior to the party, however this reporter was unable to find the former Disney child star in the after party crowd.(pictured, Zac Efron, Seth Rogen, Dave Franco)AUSTIN — To premiere at SXSW, Universal’s “Neighbors” decided to forgo the end credits, a final mix, and the aspect ratio correction, but the sold-out crowd at the Paramount Theater didn’t seem to mind.

635	"In an interview with E! News, High School Musical star Zac Efron revealed that he would be ""100 percent' up for doing a reunion of the hit Disney Channel film. Watch the interview here!""We're all thinking about it,"" the actor told E! while promoting his new comedy, Neighbors, at SXSW in Austin. ""I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.""

He added that as soon as he does see any of his HSM co-stars, ""It brings you right back to those days.""

The High School Musical franchise began as a television movie on the Disney Channel in 2006. A sequel premiered the next year followed by a feature film in 2008.

The film's soundtrack was the best-selling album in the U.S. in 2006. In 2012, it was reported that more than 225 million viewers have reportedly watched the three HSMs.

Since HSM ended, Efron has gone on to star in a variety of big screen films, including 17 Again, The Paperboy with Nicole Kidman, Parkland and most recently That Awkward Moment opposite Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller.

It was revealed in the fall that Efron had done a stint in rehab in early 2013. Not only is he looking better than ever, but if buzz is correct, Neighbors is destined to be a box office hit when it's released on May 9. ""It was neat,"" Efron said about shooting the movie's many NSFW bits. ""For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.""

In the flick, Efron plays the hard-partying president of a fraternity wreaking havoc on their next door neighbors, a young couple (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) with a baby. ""For us, we really had a fraternity,"" Efron said. ""We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun.""<

Seth Rogen's new film Neighbours had the audience in stitches as it premiered at SXSW.
A nearly complete cut of the comedy - about a couple (Seth and Rose Byrne) whose peaceful life is ruined when a fraternity moves in next door - was screened at South By Southwest to a sold-out crowd.Variety reported that Seth spoke to the audience and explained that his inspiration for a series of car airbag pranks came from YouTube videos.""There is a zero per cent survival rate and we thought it was so funny we put it in the movie 17 times, but don't do it to your friends,"" he said.The film's stars Zac Efron, who plays the fraternity's president, Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse also attended the event in Texas.Discussing the shoot, Dave told the audience he had fun filming one of the saucier scenes, according to The Hollywood Reporter.He said: ""My favourite interaction with the director Nick Stoller was during my awkward sex scene. I did the first couple takes and Nick ran upstairs and he leans in and he's like, 'Hey Dave, just, uh, like, more jack rabbit'.""After the movie, Zac told the audience: ""We will take it back to college tonight,"" and people then headed to the after party at a bar that had been decked out to look like a frat house.However, Zac - who completed a stint in rehab in 2013 for unspecified reasons - wasn't seen at the bash.

Seth Rogen speaks during The Comedy Central Roast of James Franco at Culver Studios on August 25, 2013 in Culver City, California. ― AFP picAUSTIN, March 10 — It’s OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so.
	As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, “Neighbours,” that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.
	Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes — including a cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump — the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron.
	But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film’s biggest battle turns out to be internal.
	It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to “get-off-my-lawn” adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear.
	“When you have a kid, that’s great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,” Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters yesterday in an interview after the movie’s first public screening. “That’s probably good in some ways, but it’s also a bummer in some ways.”
	Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie’s nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as “lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid” than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theatres on May 9.
	The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.
	Mac and Kelly’s frantic debate over how to say “keep it down” in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool?
	‘I KNOW THESE GUYS’
	The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O’Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are — not to mention their own fans.
	“All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying,” Rogen said with a laugh. “That to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that’s when the movie, I think, took a great shape.”
	Byrne’s likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the “Bridesmaids” actress.
	Kelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl skills to get Teddy’s girlfriend to betray him.
	Efron, characterised by Variety’s Barker as giving “one of his most credible and intriguing performances” as the charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly complex character.
	Where Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing up is flat-out terrifying — and that gives him depth, Efron said.
	He credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy’s multi-faceted character.
	“We were able to kind of find the heart in it,” Efron, 26, said. “I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I’ve felt those feelings.”
	It is OK, and it can even be cool, to grow up. — ReutersReuters Video: London City Airport closed after WW2 bomb foundBloomberg Video: The five best European destinations of 2018Reuters Video: Catalyst makes alcohol and perfume from airBlooomberg Video: How the US would launch a nuclear strikeBloomberg Video: Here are some of the reasons for Bitcoin’s declineBloomberg Video: Apple shares rise on signs of demand for priciest iPhoneCopyright ©  2018 Malay Mail OnlineAbout Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services"	Entertainment
648	"Bad Neighbours pits family man Seth Rogen against a fraternity lead by Zac Efron’s handsome dummy. It’s Project X crashing a Joe Swanberg movie
Henry Barnes

Sun 9 Mar 2014 21.45 GMT


First published on Sun 9 Mar 2014 21.44 GMT

Seth Rogen’s being a grown-up again. Fear not, those who remember Ro-Bro’s crying scene in Take This Waltz – this time the relationship stuff is played way down in the dirt. Bad Neighbours – writer-director Nicholas Stoller’s smart, disgusting gutter-dweller – has little time for the intricacies of long-term love and commitment. Instead it crashes Project X into a Joe Swanberg movie, invites it to chug the drinks and throw up all over the rug.Rogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, new parents who go to war against the college fraternity that have moved in next door. Head of the frat pack is Zac Efron as Teddy, a sweet-natured lunk who doesn’t want to keep the couple’s baby awake, but can’t pass up an opportunity to party.Stoller – the long-term Apatow collaborator who also had a hand in 2011’s Muppets revamp – has always been good at mixing profanity and pathos. His directorial debut, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, hid a sincere romantic drama behind all the dick jokes. Neighbors is far less subtle, barely bothering to check if its dignity’s in place before leaping into the next filthy setup.Rogen and Byrne have great chemistry as the thirtysomethings anxious to do right by their daughter, look cool in front of the kids and still get invited to party like they used to. Byrne’s role is meatier than most comedies – even Apatow comedies – allow their female stars. Kelly is as conniving as Mac, equally keen to get one over the college kids by doing something moronic. They’re a very likable couple, both as tempted by the hard partying lifestyle of Teddy and co as they are dismissive of it.Efron is strangely blank for the alpha-male leader of a group of marauding teens, but his support – including Dave Franco as his big-brained lieutenant, Pete, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as “blessed” numbskull Scoonie – pick up the slack. Submarine’s Craig Roberts pops up in a charming little role as a wannabe frat member. He’s full of conflicted emotions about his place in the all-male society, unsure how the house’s intensely homo-social heirarchy chimes with his need for independence. His character is called Assjuice.Bad Neighbours needs a tuck. The pacing is wobbly, the targets are too big. There are some lazy gags about post-natal sex (“she’s got these huge tits, but she insists on wearing a wife-beater. It’s like fucking Tony Soprano!”) and too much focus on Scoonie’s schlong. But it’s also an extremely funny comedy that pushes Rogen’s instinctive good nature to the limit. His stoner schtick helps to take the edge off much of the film’s crassness and gives it back some charm.• This review was first published to coincide with the SXSW premiere of Bad NeighboursHenry Barnes: Documentaries dealing with Edwyn Collins' and a Mexican drug lord were the stand-outs in a typically loud, boozy sweaty film festival that is the antitheses to Cannes in every wayCharlie Lyne's passionate but uncertain analysis of the high-school genre has the air of a wildlife documentary, writes Henry BarnesLenny Abrahamson's take on the story of papier-mache headed comedy oddbody Frank Sidebottom captures the awkward inconstancy of true talent, finds Henry Barnes"	Entertainment

652	“I was so nervous. He was sort of my God. It was at the Sunset Towers, I was 17 or 18, I idolised him at this point. I stopped him and told him, ‘Seth, I have to tell you I’m a huge fan.'” High School Musical hunk Zac Efron, 26, was star-struck meeting Knocked Up comedian Seth Rogen for the first time. The pair has since teamed up to star in new comedy Neighbours.	Entertainment
653	4 Min ReadAUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - It’s OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so. As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, “Neighbors,” that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival. Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes - including a cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump - the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron. But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film’s biggest battle turns out to be internal. It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to “get-off-my-lawn” adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear. “When you have a kid, that’s great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,” Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters on Sunday in an interview after the movie’s first public screening. “That’s probably good in some ways, but it’s also a bummer in some ways.” Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie’s nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as “lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid” than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theaters on May 9. The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn. Mac and Kelly’s frantic debate over how to say “keep it down” in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool? ‘I KNOW THESE GUYS’ The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O‘Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are - not to mention their own fans. “All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying,” Rogen said with a laugh. “That to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that’s when the movie, I think, took a great shape.” Byrne’s likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the “Bridesmaids” actress. Kelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl skills to get Teddy’s girlfriend to betray him. Efron, characterized by Variety’s Barker as giving “one of his most credible and intriguing performances” as the charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly complex character. Where Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing up is flat-out terrifying - and that gives him depth, Efron said. He credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy’s multi-faceted character. “We were able to kind of find the heart in it,” Efron, 26, said. “I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I’ve felt those feelings.” It is OK, and it can even be cool, to grow up. Editing by Mary Milliken and G CrosseAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

 Tim Falkenberg March 9th, 2014 - 1:22 PM SXSW got off to a roaring start yesterday afternoon (well, start for me; the festival proper kicked off Friday) for a couple reasons. First was the rain, which wasn’t quite “roaring” but was plenty cold and wet enough to be despised by all in line. Second was Neighbors, a comedy of young couple meets frat house starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron. There are definitely traces of Judd Apatow influence, which makes sense given that the writer, director, and at least a plurality of the producers have been involved projects from the Apatow circle of friends, but Neighbors is probably the freshest, funniest R-comedy to appear since the first Hangover. The packed Paramount theater where the film was screened, not a small venue, was roaring through basically the whole debut.And this was technically just a public debut, not a premier, because the version we were shown was called a “work in progress,” but some color and sound balance aside, this looks pretty much done. Some of the cast and production team did a short Q&A after the screening, and they said there are still a couple minor cuts to be made, but my guess is this is as much about cleaning up transitions as it is cutting material.A full review is incoming in the near future, but for now suffice it to say that Efron and Rogen seem perfectly cast. That douche Efron was playing in That Awkward Moment? This is his funnier, dumber (literally, but also in a good way), crazier college doppelganger, and he actually fits the narrative this time around. Rogen is also treading somewhat familiar territory here as the adult who still wants to party every now and then, but he does it really well. Rose Byrne is a great addition as Rogen’s wife, as is Ike Bairnholtz as Rogen’s friend and coworker who absolutely steals a few of the scenes he’s in. Also a shout out to the baby as one of the cutest, most emotive film babies I can ever remember.This movie strikes exactly the ridiculous tone you’d expect from a film with the premise of a war between a frat house and their slightly more…well, no not any more responsible neighbors, but that’s a really good thing. The production leans into the just-beyond-believable ridiculousness of it all, and – I can’t believe I’m saying this – should be commended for keeping its requisite character development and associated somber moments to a minimum and mostly out of the way. Guys, this was a really fun film.Fun fact: of all the principle cast, none of them went to college, and of the main production team, only one was actually in a frat.Tim Falkenberg[READ FULL BIO]

656	With Veronica Mars premiering yesterday Austin, it was only appropriate that the bad boys of comedy move in as well.Zac Efron, Seth Rogen, and Dave Franco made that happen and brought along their new flick Neighbors.Noticeably absent was Rose Byrne, who stars in the movie as Seth’s wife and appears to be the only actress in the film. She and Rogen face off against Franco and Efron after they move their Frat House in next door.Minus the ladies though, Zac seemed to make time for the fans outside the theatre.And along with the premiere, Mr. Efron tweeted an image of himself filming a segment for Funny or Die. Stay tuned for it, because I’m sure we’ll be on top of that when it makes its way to the internet.	Entertainment
657	Efron stars as a fraternity president who tortures Seth Rogen and Rose ByrneDon’t call Zac Efron a Disney star anymore.In “Neighbors,” an irreverent comedy directed by Nick Stoller, Efron continues his transition from teen idol to mature actor — with a big push from Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne. Efron plays Rogen’s neighbor, the president of a fraternity hellbent on making history by throwing the greatest party his college town has ever seen. He’s more than a just Rogen’s co-star, he’s the comedic foil to Rogen, one of the most successful comedy writers and actors of the past decade.Also read: Shirtless Zac Efron, Seth Rogen Tease ‘Bound 4’ Parody (Photo)“These actors that grow up through the Disney system have insane chops,” Stoller told TheWrap Saturday. “[Zac’s] very funny and knows what makes him funny. He’s not afraid to play the straight man and he has some of my favorite impov scenes.”Also read: Zac Efron Tells Jimmy Kimmel Seth Rogen ‘Wanted to Hate’ Him (Video)The movie drew a raucous applause after a “work in progress” cut of the film premiered Saturday night at South By Southwest. Though Rogen taunted a few members of the crowd, labeling one “self-serving,” Stoller deemed the festival “the best place to play a movie.” He was in Austin six years ago with the crowd-pleasing “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” his directorial debut. That movie, which features a naked Jason Segel in an early scene, is tame compared to “Neighbors.” Rogen and Byrne play a married couple horrified by the arrival of a frat next door. Yet neither is ready to grow up — as in so many recent comedies — so they get caught up trying to fight their new enemy with juvenile hijinks.The story was born when Brendan O’Brien’s wife described some youths in the neighborhood by telling a cop “I don’t’ know what they’re doing, but they’re up to no good.”“We became old at that moment,” O’Brien, who co-wrote the movie with Andrew Jay Cohen, told the crowd.See photos: 15 Gotta-See SXSW Movies: Zac Efron Bros Out and Jeremy Sisto Balls Out The movie takes this concept to the extreme. During a friendly night of partying at the neighboring frat house, Rogen takes mushrooms and “crosses streams” with Efron — a bonding mechanism of sorts. Yet the relationship deteriorates from there as Efron and his buddies, including Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse, exact retribution after Rogen and Byrne call the cops about a party. When Rogen retaliates by flooding the frat house with water, Efron devises a scheme to save it by having his brothers craft dildos from their own members and sell them. They get a hot tub out if it. All of these shenanigans are still tamer than the final party, which Stoller said was designed to be the “craziest party you’ve ever been at.”See video: SXSW: Watch Live Interviews With Seth Rogen, Robert Duvall, Emmy Rossum, Paul Wesley, Kathryn Hahn and More The writer-director learned a lot about shooting party scenes from “Get Him to the Greek,” his follow-up to “Sarah Marshall” starring Jonah Hill and Russell Brand. “Neighbors” features numerous memorable performances from comedy mainstays Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Franco, among others, but the two standouts are Byrne and Efron. Byrne plays a woman every bit as ferocious as her husband, defying the comedic trope of the controlling, bleating wife. She rejects Rogen when he tries to tell her she’s supposed to keep him in check. She even facilitates a fraternal betrayal by feeding shots to Efron’s girlfriend and Franco — and then kissing both of them. The next morning Rogen is obligated to milk Byrne’s inflated breasts.“It was important to her that this character not be a nag in any way,” Stoller told TheWrap. “Usually the woman in these movies is not that fun. My movies have gone away from that. I’ve made the female characters as funny as the guys.”Also read: Can Naked Zac Efron and ‘That Awkward Moment’ Revive Rom-Coms for the Sexting Age? As for Efron, he’s been on a mission to erase the Disney stigma and demonstrate his versatility, whether by flirting with Nicole Kidman in “The Paperboy” or palling around with Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan in “That Awkward Moment.” Kidman already peed on him in “The Paperboy,” but “Neighbors” takes the raunch to a new level. When an audience member asked him about the transition from Disney star to comedic foil, he gave the following reply, “When you get a call from Seth Rogen, you’re in a good spot.”Pictured below: Zac Efron, Seth Rogen and Dave Franco at SXSW premiere of “Neighbors”Getty Images TheWrap covers all the happenings in Austin.

We’re talking some gratuitously debaucherous middle-aged partying including magic mushrooms, sword fighting, shot ripping, and every other fraternal stereotype possible. Wildly inappropriate, of course, but with Nicholas Stoller’s outlandish direction, Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O’Brien watch their screenplay turn into a riotous Greek life comedy that’ll make you question every responsible decision you made throughout your college career. Stoller himself admitted that only one member of his production team actually lived a fraternity life in college, so you can imagine the generalizations and stereotypes blown wildly out of proportion, but it’s all in the name of comedy – and the most epic rager that frat life could possibly imagine.Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are new parents enjoying their more modest suburban lifestyle, embracing early nights and child care instead of raves and late night diner trips. Their life is your simple blue-collar affair, and their neighborhood equatable to Anywhere, USA – until a fraternity moves in next door. Led by President Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and his Vice President Pete (Dave Franco), this is your Animal House style fraternity with the dial cranked even higher, as it’s Teddy’s mission to earn his rightful place on the frat’s Hall of Fame board, along with the supposed inventors of the Toga Party and every college kid’s best friend, the Boot and Rally. This doesn’t bode well for the Radner’s humble lifestyle, so they decide to fight back. Can Mac and Kelly party hard enough to infiltrate the frat and get them evicted? If there’s one brotherhood you should avoid starting a war with, it’s an immature, vengeful frat – something that the Radners are about to find out.Graduating from High School Musical heartthrob to full-blown college douche, Zac Efron was meant to play the testosterone-charged frat superhero Teddy Sanders. Efron has never been funnier, and getting away from his “good guy” persona creates a completely embellished caricature that’s entirely too much fun to ignore, pairing nicely with his second-in-command played by Dave Franco – another young actor who pops his collar and leaves us in stitches. The chemistry between these two is highlighted by a scene I can only dream was improvised on set, recording Teddy and Pete’s genius reinventions of the phrase “bros before hos” – only to have Pete heartbroken later when Teddy doesn’t acknowledge the “bropology” that took place, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT RHYMED! Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael round out our alpha dogs, one a certifiable porn star and the other a hopeless pothead, but it’s Teddy and Pete who ultimately win us over through wicked epicness – that’s what the kids say these days, right?As for Rogen and Byrne – where do I start? Again, for any aspiring parents at home, you’ll have to understand the fact that Neighbors is meant to be nothing but drunken fun, and it succeeds mightily. The Radners leave their child at home for an entire night full of fraternity partying, and get sufficiently intoxicated, but everything is alright because Rose has her baby monitor. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME – but please witness the utter hilarity that our bored couple creates.Neighbors is essentially pornography for adults who fantasize about reliving their glory years, now unable to slug Jager and take two story bong rips, as those viewers can live vicariously through Rogen and Byrne – a comedic dream couple. Whether it’s Rogen dancing his ass off while wearing a goofy gansta’ hat or Byrne turning from innocent housewife into manipulative female she-demon, these two talents riff off one another with perfect comedic ease, again aiding Stoller’s admittedly overplayed mentality. Oh, and Byrne – please stick to only horror and comedy from here on out. Please?!As for the party-hearty shenanigans throughout Neighbors, Stoller and company create every college boy’s fantasy while also somehow addressing fears that come along with leaving college – albeit nothing but surface recognition. You’re here to laugh, and watching Rogen attempt to keep up with Efron delivers “first pot brownie” hilarity. Blacklights, kegs, drugs, sorority girls, bro bonding, tank tops, Robert De Niro themed parties – Neighbors goes for broke and succeeds in creating one of the funniest fraternal comedies since Animal House – the Holy Grail of college humor. Stoller’s complete disregard for reality is his greatest weapon, subduing audiences with masculine hugs and spot on sight gags that again live in some fantasy world where airbags can hide in chairs, launching unknowing victims into crumbly tile ceilings. Nothing will make you miss college more until you realize your college life was nothing like Teddy’s – and then you’ll just want to pull an Old School.Neighbors is like walking into a frat party and witnessing a game of beer pong between Willie Nelson, Kenny Powers, and the Coors Light commercial twins – it’s probably just a hallucinogenic tease brought on by some “party favors” you popped earlier, but for the time being, it’s nothing but pure, entertaining bliss. Attacking “bro” culture with the energy of a ‘roided out grizzly bear, Stoller pushes comedy farther than he’s ever attempted, an easy achievement with such a star-studded comedic cast. Efron is a pastel plastered revelation, and has honestly never been funnier – the same goes for Byrne, minus the abs and plus a maternal surprise. Sure, there’s a paper-thin story that doesn’t really strike the serious notes of maturing, growing older, and accepting a more “normal” life – but with non-stop laughs and gut-busting highlights, Neighbors is a death cup victory on Team Stoller’s first pong shots.Come for the beer pong, stay for the blacklight dance party, and enjoy every minute of this ridiculous fraternity comedy featuring hilariously ""broish"" performances that embrace every enjoyable stereotype.From the web"	Entertainment

660	"Matt Barone is a staff writer at Complex who specializes in covering movies and TV.@MBarone | facebook | linkedin | google+""Who here is a little bit drunk?""And to that question, damn near everyone in attendance at last night&apos;s Neighbors world premiere screening at the SXSW Film Festival broke out in thunderous applause. And we&apos;re talking upwards of 1,000 rowdy cinephiles, too, being that Neighbors was unveiled at Austin&apos;s Paramount Theatre, a 1,100-seat venue that resembles one of those old-school opera houses, complete with side balconies and an upper seating level.The man asking the question: director Nicholas Stoller, getting the crowd hyped up for his new movie&apos;s first-ever screening. Stoller&apos;s back at SXSW after the successful 2008 premiere of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his directorial debut prefacing Get Him to the Greek. Where Sarah Marshall was a raucous but often tender look at failed love and loneliness, Neighbors is a totally different beast. Foul-mouthed, kinetic, and lean (clocking in at a just-right 95 minutes), it&apos;s consistently hilarious—come May 9, when Neighbors officially opens theatrically, it will be the funniest movie a major Hollywood studio (in this case, Universal Pictures) will have released since 2012&apos;s Jump Street.There was hardly a quiet moment throughout the screening, due in large part to the film's loaded cast, all of whom are on the entire time. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Mac and Kelly Rdner, a happily married couple trying to keep the flame going despite the fact that they're raising an infant girl, Stella (a natural born scene-stealer if there ever was one). To complicate their domestic life, Delta Psi Beta, a fraternity made up of mostly dim-witted meatheads, moves into the house next door, turning Teddy and Kelly's neighborhood into a 24/7 reenactment of National Lampoon&apos;s Animal House. Led by president Teddy (Zac Efron) and his VP, Pete (Dave Franco), the frat dudes go to the extremes of partying—at one point, they turn their entire home into a ""hotbox house,"" which, yes, is close what it sounds like, only much more set-design ambitious. It doesn't help Mac's situation that Teddy's beyond ripped, with arms that, as Mac puts it, look like ""two big veiny dicks.""Neighbors is, for the most part, a tightly connected series of sight gags and profane one-liners, but unlike most Hollywood comedies, very few of the film&apos;s jokes miss. It&apos;d be too obvious to single out Rogen&apos;s performance, even though he hasn&apos;t been this funny on-screen since Knocked Up. An ensemble piece, Neighbors features two unexpected MVP performances from Dave Franco and Rose Byrne. Franco, playing off of the similarly impressive against-type Efron, gets just as many strong punch-lines as Rogen, while Byrne never lets the dominant comedic force who&apos;s playing her fictional other-half overshadow her. In fact, she got the premiere&apos;s biggest round of applause, coming after a set-piece in which Mac and Kelly strategically turn Teddy and Pete against each other by challenging the old ""bros before hoes"" conceit.Byrne&apos;s big moment happens in the midst of one of the film&apos;s many frat house raves, all of which radiate with flashing neon lights, energetic handheld camerawork, and unruly close-ups and camera angles. During the post-screening Q&A, for which the entire cast minus Rose Byrne participated, Stoller cited the 2009 French head-trip film Enter the Void as a ""visual touchstone"" used by he and director of photography Brandon Trost for the Neighbors party scenes, and it shows.Not that Stoller or any of his cast were able to bring any personal experiences to those sequences, though. While introducing the film, Stoller dedicated it to producer James Weaver, the only person involved with Neighbors who was ever in a fraternity. ""The rest of us,"" said Stoller, ""were Jews and child stars. Thank you, James, for explaining to me what an elephant walk is.""Once the movie ended, Stoller hopped back on stage along with the entire cast. Unsurprisingly, that's when Seth Rogen took over the proceedings. The first question came from one rather enthusiastic audience member, a guy who stepped into one of the aisles to make sure Rogen and company could clearly see him. ""That was one of the best movies I've ever seen,"" he said, spending a solid 60 seconds repeating that sentiment with different phrasings. At his final ""best movie ever"" exclamation, Rogen didn't waste a second. ""I'm gonna fuck the shit out of that guy! The second this is over!""The only time one of Rogen&apos;s responses earned a larger outburst of clapping than that? When another audience member cited a bit in Neighbors where Rogen and Efron&apos;s characters, both excessively drunk and high, discuss their personal favorite Batmans—the older Mac prefers Michael Keaton and the much younger Teddy likes Christian Bale. The question for Rogen was, simply, ""Who&apos;s Batman to you?"" Showing love to Keaton, he asked the crowd, ""Who here like the George Clooney Batman? Absolutely no one.""The Q&A as a whole, not unlike Neighbors itself, maintained that kind of random humor. Barely any of the audience&apos;s questions pertained directly to the movie. One obnoxious guy, for shame, asked the cast and crew if they&apos;d take an ""epic selfie"" like Ellen Degeneres&apos; at the Academy Awards—fortunately, Rogen quickly shot that request down.The last question of the night: ""Will there be a sequel?""""No,"" said Rogen. ""First this one needs to make money, and none of you paid to be here, as far as I know.""""So, basically,"" continued Stoller, ""it hasn&apos;t made any money yet.""Written by Matt Barone (@MBarone)For more of Complex Pop Culture&apos;s SXSW coverage, click here."

The last time Universal screened one of their big summer comedies at South by Southwest, it turned out to be “Bridesmaids“—a movie that not only went on to be a massive financial success (and a breakthrough for its cowriter/star Kristin Wiig) but a critical one as well, even earning an Academy Award nomination for its screenplay. So a fair amount of anticipation and excitement greeted tonight’s “work-in-progress” (although look, it seems totally finished) screening of the new Seth Rogen/Zac Efron comedy “Neighbors.” And while “Neighbors” doesn’t come close to capturing “Bridesmaids'” emotional honesty, it could have a chance of one-upping that film in the box office. Simply put, “Neighbors” is one of the funniest, most visually inventive studio comedies in recent memory.When “Neighbors” opens, Rogen and his adorable wife, played by “Bridesmaids” star Rose Byrne, have just moved into a lovely suburban home with their new baby girl. Clearly, it’s a period of adjustment—they want to go out with their friends but really can’t, and find themselves falling asleep all the time and having very little uninterrupted sex (in a great scene they have to turn the kid around to keep her from watching them). They face an even greater obstacle when their domestic tranquility is threatened when a fraternity, led by Efron and Dave Franco, moves in next door.






At first they decide to try and bond with their new neighbors, bringing over a peace offering in the form of a perfectly rolled joint and trying their damnedest to be cool (the walk over to the house accompanied by slow motion and a hip hop song might be expected, but it still totally works). The thought is if their new neighbors think that they’re hip and cool, then they’ll probably be more willing to turn down the music and keep the chaos to a minimum. Rogen and Byrne also attend one of the frat’s early, out-of-control parties, which is the opening salvo in what turns out to be some of the most elaborately choreographed and beautifully photographed party sequences we’ve ever seen in a mainstream studio comedy (their wild night spent drinking their faces off ends in a wonderful scene reminiscent of “The Trip,” with Efron and Rogen comparing Batman impressions.) An understanding is reached: if the frat is getting too out of hand, Rogen should just call Efron and not the cops. But the next night the partying is just as bad, all hell breaks loose and this truce is swiftly overturned (the attending officer is played by the great comedian Hannibal Buress). While the cops are dismissed, the perceived betrayal acts as an opening salvo to a much larger war, with the frat staging party after earth-shattering party and the married couple fighting back in turn.Other than documenting this natural schism between suburban squareness and the unhinged bacchanal of fraternity life, “Neighbors” is otherwise low on plot, but the jokes and set pieces are so good that it doesn’t really matter. This movie is full of jokes (they seem to ricochet off of each other in all sorts of spectacular ways), and it’s not just the sheer volume of jokes that impresses – it’s the fact that jokes that connect, consistently, more often than not. Rarely does this kind of broad, sometimes crass studio comedy hit its mark so often. It’s consistency is sublime.






Rogen and director Nicholas Stoller (“Get Him to the Greek,” “Five Year Engagement”) are already intimately familiar with he “manchild” subgenre of comedy, having both milked the set-up of a man who refuses to grow up for pretty much all its worth. But “Neighbors” seems new and fresh and different; it’s edgy without ever been outwardly offensive and bro-ish in an inclusive, not obstructive way. Writers Andrew Cohen and Brendan O’Brien are able to explore the idea of longing for that type of that childish behavior while negotiating the path to maturity (free of mushrooms and bong hits) in an organic and credible manner. There isn’t a whole lot of screen time devoted to the clever twist that Efron’s fratboy is Rogen’s idealized, younger self, and in turn that Efron is grappling with the idea that he’ll soon leave the childish antics of the fraternity behind, settling into a role of adult mediocrity, but it’s there and adds a lovely, melancholy undercurrent to the movie that makes the entire experience much richer. In a way, it plays like some kind of bizarre time travel movie… except one with a lot of drug jokes and girls in bikinis.Efron and Rogen are flanked by a ridiculously terrific supporting cast, including Ike Barinholtz as Rogen’s best friend, Lisa Kudrow as the dean of the frat’s college, “Submarine” star Craig Roberts as a pledge known as “Assjuice” and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as another fraternity brother (one whose, um, member is legendarily huge). But the breakthrough performance in the movie, and the one that took tonight’s SXSW screening by storm, is Rose Byrne. For a while she has been a talented actress playing second banana roles in a number of Judd Apatow comedies (minus last year’s abysmal “I Give It A Year“) and odd genre affairs, always stealing a scene here and there but never warping the entire movie around her greatness. But with “Neighbors,” she nearly steals the entire movie, and certainly gets the surprise comedy MVP award. This is an especially large shock considering that she’s set up to inhabit the largely thankless role of the “loud funny guy’s boring hot wife.” But there is so, so much more here. There is one scene in particular, that takes place at a black light party, that’s an astoundingly funny jaw-dropper. She has proven herself to be a fearless comedic performer, one who is absolutely awe-inspiring in this movie. Rose Byrne is second banana no more.Equally impressive is Stoller’s direction, accompanied by Brandon Trost‘s cinematography. Most studio comedies look flat and over-lit, but “Neighbors” is bathed in deep shadows, with the party sequences electrifying the movie in dazzling ways. Stoller seems patently unafraid of trying new things—and really weird stuff at that, there’s a damn star wipe in this movie for crying out loud—while Trost, a former confederate of Rob Zombie, pushes the visuals brilliantly. The black light party looks like something out of “Spring Breakers” (and, during the Q&A, Stoller said he took inspiration from “Enter the Void“), while other party sequences take on their own unique cadences. The movie as a whole has a wonderfully playful rhythm, with the jokes rising and falling like crests of a giant ocean wave. But the party sequences really allow the filmmakers to break that rhythm and stretch themselves creatively; they’re each like their own little movies. Away from the slightly pat comedies that he has made in the past, Stoller shines. Like Rogen, he seems to have found freedom in maturity, recognizing that it’s easy to find the sublime in silliness. Or is it the other way around? With “Neighbors,” we laughed until we ached. Then we laughed some more.

664	"Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Rose Byrne, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Dave Franco, Ike Barinholtz, Lisa Kudrow, Jake Johnson.Lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid than anything its director Nicholas Stoller and star Seth Rogen have ever been involved with before, frat comedy “Neighbors” boasts an almost oppressive volume of outrageous gags, and provided that audiences don’t mind the lack of anything resembling a coherent story arc, its commercial potential ought to be enormous. Presented as a work-in-progress at SXSW (though aside from missing credits and a few continuity quirks, it appears largely finished), “Neighbors” is an unchecked riot that should go a long way toward selling antagonist Zac Efron as a credible adult actor, though as with anything involving the Greek system, a bit more moderation from the start might have prevented a few headaches afterward.Rogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, a young married couple whose infant daughter has prompted a move into the suburbs. Aside from the disruption to their sex and social lives — their efforts to organize “baby’s first rave” notwithstanding — the couple seem to be managing the transition to parenthood well, until the property next door is taken over by the Delta Psi Beta fraternity, led by peacocking president Teddy (Efron) and his brainy, just barely sublimated love interest, Pete (Dave Franco).

Film Review: 'The Widowed Witch'




The frat’s arrival forces Mac and Kelly to confront their own accelerating decline into old fogeydom, as they frantically debate the least-uncool way to deliver the phrase “could you keep it down?” to their new neighbors. The two parties extend some initial olive branches, with Teddy inviting the couple over for some magic mushrooms and Mac strenuously attempting to use the word “trill” in conversation, but when Mac and Kelly finally call the cops on one of the frat’s weeknight ragers, the two houses declare all-out war.While the film’s first 15 or so minutes bear a notable resemblance to Stoller’s shaggier, more amiable previous efforts like “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “The Five-Year Engagement,” at this point the director allows chaos to reign supreme, with the pic quickly turning into “Revenge of the Nerds” by way of “Spring Breakers.” Mac and Kelly’s meeting with the university dean (Lisa Kudrow) reveals that the frat has only two disciplinary strikes left before it will be disbanded, and the couple instigates an elaborate campaign of sabotage, with Delta house responding in kind.There’s little here that makes much sense from a narrative standpoint — indeed, Rogen’s 2013 hit, “This Is the End,” might as well be Bergman by comparison — yet only occasionally does it matter. Subplots involving Mac and Kelly’s best buddy (Ike Barinholtz) appear to be missing key establishing scenes. At times the film abandons all pretense of sketching a real dramatic arc altogether, simply lining up one outlandish, frenzied setpiece after another. And at the end of the day, there’s no real reason for Efron and Rogen to stage an epic kung fu battle using plaster casts of the Delta house members’ members. But sticklers will be few and far between.






Relegated to middling girlfriend roles for far too long, Byrne is here cast as the most foul-mouthed matriarch this side of “August: Osage County,” and she attacks the role with almost maniacal enthusiasm. But it’s the eternally shirtless ex-teen idol Efron, surprisingly, who delivers the film’s most intriguing performance, crafting a dime-turning combination of brotherly earnestness and Mephistophelean sadism that will ring true to anyone who ever found themselves on the losing end of a wooden paddle.In some of the film’s best scenes, particularly a hysterical coda outside an Abercrombie & Fitch store, Rogen and Efron’s characters seem less nemeses than distorted reflections of one another. (On some level, Teddy seems to realize it’s only a matter of years before he’ll find himself on the other side of the fence, tormented by a jerk exactly like himself.) It might have been interesting to see a somewhat deeper, more Apatovian take on this theme, though “deeper” is not a direction the film ever seems interested in navigating.There are a number of missed marks, however. A gag about infant HIV really needs to be funnier than this one is to justify its existence, while a woefully pointless breast-pump fiasco sequence feels almost cynically engineered just to give the film a “Bridesmaids”-style bodily function conversation-starter. (It may as well have been referred to in the script as “that scene.”) It’s an unnecessary but unsurprising move for a movie that values volume over consistency.Technically speaking, the pic is much better shot and edited than a college comedy really needs to be, with the frequent party scenes in particular taking on an almost surrealistic timbre.SXSW Film Review: 'Neighbors'Reviewed at SXSW Film Festival (Headliners), March 8, 2014.

666	"It is a bit ironic that Netflix while locked in a battle with cable companies for viewers eyeballs, and depending on them for most of their content, are now making money by selling it back to them.For Comcast subscribers who have resisted the temptation to get a Netflix account, hit shows such as House of Cards can now be watched, although you will need to pay for it through the Xfinity Store.Comcast have signed a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, who manage international and home video distribution for the hit political series. But the show which convinced many viewers to sign up to a Netflix subscription plan, can now be accessed without joining up.Comcast are making available the first season one of the political drama series starring Kevin Spacey, and they are not stopping there. They have also revealed that in a seperate deal with Lionsgate, they will be offering another Netflix original,  Orange is the New Black in May.The Xfinity Store is Comcast’s pay-as-you-watch service for streaming content, letting customers buy movies and TV shows and stream them on a number of connected devices.The deal is important, because it means that Comcast viewers need not miss out on award winning shows that are now not exclusive to Netflix. Although looking deeper into the deal, it is not great value for money. Although exact prices are not yet known, Comcast will probably charge $1.99-$2.99 per episode, whereas Netflix costs $8 per month with unlimited streaming, and access to the second season.But if it means Comcast can convince viewers to not ‘cut-the-cord‘ then it will be a job well done. House of Cards is also available on Blu-ray and DVD as well as from other online retailers such as Amazon Instant Video.Related News:

668	Comcast broadband subscribers are already enjoying better Netflix streaming performance just two weeks after the companies struck an agreement to directly connect their networks — and Netflix says even better performance is on the way.In its latest ISP speed index released Monday, Netflix said that prime-time video streams on Comcast averaged 1.68Mbps in February, up from 1.51Mbps in January, reversing months of steady declines and boosting Comcast’s ranking by two spots on the list. Prior to February, the average performance of Netflix streaming video content delivered to Comcast subscribers declined by more than 25% over the last few months. As recently as October of last year, Netflix was streaming at 2.07Mbps.As part of the deal — known as a paid-peering or transit agreement — Netflix gained a direct connection to the Comcast’s network, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as third-party intermediaries between residential broadband companies and Internet firms. Financial terms of the arrangement were not disclosed. The pact was announced on February 23 and the improved connections began several days before that, but the performance increases will take some time before they’re fully felt by all Netflix users with Comcast service.(MORE: Comcast’s Traffic Pact With Netflix Is Shrouded in Secrecy)Despite the boost in performance, Comcast remains below the U.S. streaming average of 1.95Mbps, but further improvements are on the way, per Netflix. “We do expect to see Comcast’s performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data as a result of the recent agreement between Netflix and Comcast,” Joris Evers, director of communications at Netflix, wrote in a company blog post.Google Fiber, the tech giant’s gigabit broadband service, remains by far the fastest U.S. provider of Netflix streaming video, with average performance of 3.74Mbps, according to the company. In the blog post, Netflix called Google Fiber “the guiding North Star for broadband performance in the country.” Google has already launched fiber initiatives in Kansas City, Austin and Provo, and last month announced plans to work with nine more metro areas to expand the service.Among major U.S. broadband providers, Verizon DSL is the slowest, with average performance of 0.93Mbps. Verizon’s high-speed FiOS service is slightly faster than Comcast at 1.76Mbps, but that service continues to decline in the rankings, as does AT&T U-verse, which clocked in at 1.66 Mbps.In the wake of Netflix’s deal with Comcast, Verizon and AT&T both acknowledged that they are seeking to reach an agreement with the streaming video service. As high-bandwidth services like Netflix have exploded in popularity, the broadband companies are increasingly seeking compensation in exchange for direct connections to improve performance.Netflix says its ISP speed index is “based on data from the more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide who view over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix each month. The listed speeds reflect the average performance of all Netflix streams on each ISP’s network and are an indicator of the performance typically experienced across all users on an ISP network. A faster network generally means a better picture quality, quicker start times and fewer interruptions.”	Entertainment
669	"In this golden age of cable television, where TV production values are at an all-time high and major Hollywood actors are flocking to the small screen to make hits, a lot of the best programming is trapped behind a paywall. This includes Netflix, since the movie and TV show rental and streaming service has created its own successful original programming that you must be a subscriber to watch.""House of Cards"" is probably its biggest original hit yet, garnering a lot of praise and hype while featuring an A-list actor, Kevin Spacey. But, those who don't have access to a Netflix account have been locked out. Good news for any Comcast customers out there: you can now buy season one on your cable provider's Xfinity store through a deal with Sony.I know, I know--it's not included just for being a customer like you may have been hoping. But since it won't be airing on any particular channel that you pay for or subscribe to in a package, it's not going to be given away for free.A one-time purchase may be better for you if you really don't want to pay for a subscription, but it might really be worth it to join Netflix and get access to the next season as well, in addition to their other shows, rather than paying for seasons at a time. Plus, if you ever switch providers, it's more than likely your access to ""House of Cards"" will be no more.Season one was actually quietly released on DVD and Blu-ray over the summer by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment without much fanfare, and didn't include any features or bonus content. It's also available as a digital download from Amazon Instant Video. Also anounced is that ""Orange is the New Black"" is coming to Comcast customers as well in May.Source: The VergeCopyright © 2017  GAMENGUIDE All rights reserved."	Entertainment

Comcast has scored another knife-twist on its semi-adversary, Netflix. The cable provider now allows customers to stream the first season of House of Cards from its Xfinity Store, according to a report from Variety. The new partnership comes just weeks after Comcast successfully persuaded Netflix to pay to improve the quality of its service for Comcast subscribers.House of Cards was one of the first original series produced for and streamed on Netflix in a bulk serving of 13 episodes. The series was paid for in part by Netflix, reportedly to the tune of $100 million, but the price it paid did not cover rights that would prevent it from falling into Comcast's hands.Media Rights Capital is the studio that made up the rest of the cost of the show, and it's handling distribution through Sony. Currently, House of Cards is also available on DVD, but not on any other streaming services.Further ReadingHouse of Cards: The “13-hour movie” defining the Netflix experienceThrough the Sony deal, Comcast will also get a slew of other movies and TV shows onto Xfinity, including American Hustle and Breaking Bad. For its next trick, Comcast will also make Orange is the New Black appear on Xfinity—but not until May 13.You must login or create an account to comment."	Entertainment
671	"House of Cards, the popular Netflix original that snubbed HBO for the Internet video streaming service, will soon be available to Comcast Xfinity subscribers who don’t have a Netflix account. Such is the result of a recent deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, which handles certain elements of the show’s distribution.
The deal applies for the first season of House of Cards, which allows Comcast subscribers to download the show via the relatively new Xfinity Store service on to their set-top box — no Netflix subscription is needed, a perk for those who don’t want to double-down on their video subscriptions.This joins the show’s availability through VUDU and Amazon, as well, which sells the show out part-and-parcel at about $2 per episode. Those who want to check out the second season will still need Netflix for the time being, though that season will likely also find its way onto the VOD services in due time as well.Those who enjoy Netflix’s other popular original show “Orange is the New Black” will also be able to enjoy it through Comcast Xfinity starting May 13, which Variety reports is the result of a distribution deal with Lionsgate. Soon other Sony shows will be available through the service, as well, including The Amazing Spider-Man.VIA: BGR

Typically, episodes cost $1.99 for SD and $2.99 for HD.Netflix has the exclusive streaming rights to the political drama, but as Variety pointed out, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment covers international and home video distribution.

Titles including American Hustle, Breaking Bad, Captain Phillips, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, The Amazing Spider-Man and 21 Jump Street should be soon available.Xfinity Store customers have the option of watching their chosen shows on the TV, on a computer in a browser, or on a smartphone/tablet with the appropriate Xfinity On Demand Purchases app for iOS and Android.Copyright 2018 BGR Media, LLCPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use	Entertainment
675	"Chris Crum03.10.2014IT ManagementShare this PostComcast subscribers have the ability to watch House of Cards without Netflix thanks to a new deal with Sony Pictures, Variety reports. Comcast will sell the first season of the show through its Xfinity Store in addition to to other titles like American Hustle, Breaking Bad, Captain Phillips, Cloud With a Chance of Meatballs 2, The Amazing Spider-Man and 21 Jump Street. Of course this isn't the first time people have been able to legally watch House of Cards without Netflix. The first season was released on DVD last June, and has ben available for purchase from other digital media sellers. According to Variety, Comcast users will also be getting Orange is the New Black's first season on May 13th thanks to a similar deal with Lionsgate. Separately, Comcast and Netflix recently reached a deal to ensure that Netflix's content is streamed at high quality for customers. No word on when Comcast will get House of Cards: Season 2, but it presumably won't be until it's released on DVD. The third season is currently being written.

677	Comcast today announced that it has signed an agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment to sell the studio’s titles through the Xfinity On Demand digital store. In the coming weeks, Xfinity TV customers will be able to purchase Sony Pictures movies and TV shows to own and access anytime on any device, kicking off with American Hustle, timed to the film’s DVD release. Additional Sony Pictures movie and TV titles that will be available for purchase in the coming weeks include Breaking Bad, as well as popular movies such as Captain Phillips, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, The Amazing Spider-Man and 21 Jump Street.“Sony Pictures is pleased that this agreement brings significant titles to Comcast customers,” said Man Jit Singh, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment president, in a release. “We deeply value our relationship with Comcast and look forward to working closely with them to meet the needs of all audiences.”Most excitingly for TV fans, the Comcast/Sony deal will allow Comcast subscribers to purchase episodes of Netflix shows, even if they don’t have a Netflix subscription. At $1.99 an episode, it’s not exactly a steal compared to a monthly Netflix subscription, but it’s another option for fans who want to keep up with Frank Underwood’s exploits on House of Cards.

678	"House of Cards may have made Netflix's name as a source of must-see original content, but millions of Comcast customers aren't going to need Netflix to watch the show anymore.In a deal with Sony, Comcast will now sell its subscribers access to the first season of the political drama through its own Xfinity Store, Variety reports. In Hollywood terms, the arrangement might not be anything remarkable – just a new way of syndicating reruns. But cutting Netflix out of the picture for its signature show sends a clear signal that the entertainment and cable industries aren't about to let some Northern California tech company change television without exacting a price.Thanks to the company's aggressive marketing, House of Cards is known as a Netflix show just as much as The Sopranos was an HBO show. But even the $100 million it reportedly spent didn't buy Netflix all the rights to Frank Underwood's Machiavellian rise. Apparently, that money gave Netflix only the exclusive right to stream two seasons online first, and it didn't even cover the total production costs of the first 26 episodes. The rest of the costs fell on Media Rights Capital, the independent studio that actually made House of Card, and it is free to sell other rights.To make its money back, the studio has a deal with Sony to handle distribution of House of Cards internationally and for ""home video,"" a term that in the Netflix streaming-video era seems meaningless. In practice, it means Sony gets to sell House of Cards DVDs and other ways for couch surfers to pay a la carte for the show, such as on Amazon Instant Video. That appears to be the kind of agreement Comcast struck with Sony, which also lets the cable provider offer access to Sony movies such as American Hustle ahead of other video-on-demand services.For Comcast, the movies seem like the meat of the deal, while the House of Cards arrangement is more about sending a message to Netflix and the general public. The rise of Netflix and other streaming services have encouraged the rise of ""cord-cutting,"" which threatens the cable business, and Comcast isn't taking this laying down. Recently, Comcast exercised its own leverage by getting Netflix to pay for more direct access to Comcast's network, and now, the cable giant to making another move with its House of Cards deal, showing that it can cannibalize Netflix's business right back.Not that a swarm of Comcast customers are about to go out and spend money to watch House of Cards somewhere other than Netflix – or at least they shouldn't. It's not clear how much Comcast plans to charge. But on Amazon, for instance, high-definition episodes are $2.99 a piece, or nearly $39 for the whole season. That's almost as much as five months of Netflix, which also includes season two, as well as Orange Is the New Black, another Netflix hit coming to Comcast soon. But just by making House of Cards an option, Comcast is eating into the brand identity Netflix is trying to establish for itself as the only place to watch ""its"" shows.Original programming has become crucial to Netflix's business model. By getting House of Cards, Comcast sends a subtle signal to Netflix non-subscribers that maybe they don't need to spend that extra eight dollars a month after all. They might not actually pay Comcast to watch House of Cards either, but just knowing they could get the show there might be enough. On the other hand, if anyone does watch the first season of House of Cards on cable, Netflix still has a powerful advantage: the siren song of season two.CNMN CollectionUse of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement (effective 3/21/12) and privacy policy (effective 3/21/12).

685	"Comcast customers can now buy access to “House of Cards” season 1 through their cable set-top box and watch it across multiple devices — no Netflix subscription required.The cable giant struck a pact with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, giving Comcast rights to sell the Emmy-winning first season of “House of Cards” through the recently launched Xfinity TV Store service. Netflix currently owns exclusive streaming rights to the Media Rights Capital-produced series, while Sony handles international and homevideo distribution.Comcast’s plan to sell “HoC” season 1 — at $1.99 per episode — seems perplexing, given Netflix’s $7.99 per month price point. But it’s interesting body language from the No. 1 MSO, given Netflix’s desire to reach a deal to have its service embedded into Comcast set-tops. Meanwhile “House of Cards” first season has been available on other EST services, including Amazon and Walmart’s Vudu, also priced at $1.99 per episode for SD and $2.99 each for HD.






In addition, Comcast will add select Sony titles to its early electronic sell-through service, which offers access ahead of the traditional VOD-rental window. The first of these is “American Hustle,” to be available for rent or purchase starting Tuesday, followed by Tom Hanks-starrer “Captain Phillips” in a few weeks.

There was a recent stir of controversy, as Comcast took a sudden nose-dive in the standings. This came, rather coincidentally, just before Netflix paid up for better service. In fairness, the deal was already in the works during the drop-off, so it was at best a negotiation tactic.With that mess now in the rear-view mirror, Netflix announces it is expanding the list of ISPs that it plans to track and include on its monthly shame and fame list.""We expanded the list to provide insight into the performance of many of the smaller providers in the US and to give credit where it is due. For example, Midcontinent, a regional cable provider in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, takes second place in the expanded rankings"", says Joris Evers of Netflix.The service also took the opportunity to tweak its new cable partner just a bit, stating ""we do expect to see Comcast's performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data"".The data is culled from more than 44 million Netflix customers worldwide, as the company also tracks ISPs in Mexico and The Netherlands, among other places.

3.10.14 1:51 PM EST  By Chris Morran@themorrancavepay to play netflix comcast time warner cable verizon fios google fiber paid peeringAfter months of slowed-down data speeds for Netflix users on Comcast and Time Warner Cable’s network, speeds rebounded the very same month that Netflix agreed to pay Comcast money for more direct access to its network. As you can see from the graph above, generated from Netflix’s monthly report, Comcast customers saw a dramatic turnaround in streaming speeds, going from about 1.5 Mbps to 1.7 Mbps. Though that is still far off from the 2.1 Mbps speeds Comcast users were seeing before their ISP’s numbers started to tank, it is hopefully the beginning of an upward trend. Of course, there wasn’t really much worse Comcast speeds could get.What’s interesting is that the Netflix deal wasn’t announced until late February, with only a few days left in the month. Had Comcast eased up on congested peering points in expectation of the agreement being finalized? Likewise, since no paid peering deal with Time Warner Cable has been announced, we have to wonder if the sudden improvement in TWC’s speeds are tied to its proposed merger with Comcast. Granted, TWC’s speed results have been so erratic that it’s possible this uptick is just a matter of someone using the good duct tape to fix a loose connection somewhere. Meanwhile, Verizon FiOS speeds have sunk from being the best and steadiest of the three providers to substandard levels. Netflix is reportedly in talks with Verizon for a paid-peering deal of some sort, so those numbers will likely improve; it’s just a question of when — and how bad Verizon will allow the connection to get before customers revolt.For comparison’s sake, here is how these three providers look compared to Google Fiber, the fastest ISP on Netflix’s charts:

689	Not too long ago Netflix stepped into production of original content, and it scored a massive win with House of Cards. This Emmy winning series stars Kevin Spacey as a ruthless Congressman who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, and the best thing about it is that Netflix releases all episodes of the season on one day, so fans can binge for as long as they want. Naturally, Netflix subscribers have to pay for the service, but now Comcast subscribers have another way out. Comcast Cable president and CEO revealed today that House of Cards will be available in the Xfinity Store soon.From the Xfinity Store, Comcast subscribers will be able to buy access to House of Cards without requiring Netflix. Initially only the first season will be available, and it hasn’t been said when the second season, which came out last month, will be added. Orange is the New Black, another acclaimed Netflix original series,Â will also make its way to the Xfinity Store, albeit on May 13th.Xfinity Store is quite similar to Netflix and Amazon Instant, launched last November, it lets Comcast subscribers stream movies and TV shows. Its not known right now how much both original series will cost on Xfinity Store.Filed in Web. Read more about Comcast and Netflix.	Entertainment

While Netflix has spent the last several years dutifully trying to convince content providers to license TV shows and movies to the subscription video-on-demand service—all while simultaneously developing its own original content to draw in viewers HBO-style—now it looks as though the tables have turned.Comcast subscribers will soon be able to watch House of Cards via their cable set-top box sans Netflix subscription. That’s according to a report from Variety, which notes that Comcast made a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, thereby giving Comcast the rights to sell the series through its newly launched Xfinity Store.While Netflix owns exclusive streaming rights to House of Cards, Sony is in charge of international and home distribution. Comcast also made a deal with Lionsgate that will give it rights to sell Netflix’s other highly acclaimed original series Orange is the New Black in May.Comcast has confirmed the report, but Netflix could not be reached for comment.This doesn’t mean that Comcast subscribers can stream Netflix free of additional costs. It’s the digital equivalent of buying the DVD set when it hits the shelves months after the season airs. Non-Netflix users have been able to watch House of Cards since season one was released on DVD last June. It’s also available in other digital stores, such as Amazon Instant Video, Walmart.com, and Verizon Fios.A Comcast spokesperson says that House of Cards will be available in the Xfinity Store within the next 30 days, and that it will only be the first season of the show. The second season will presumably become available in the Xfinity Store some time around or after it’s made available on DVD.Previously, Netflix was in discussions with Comcast about the possibility of bringing a Netflix app to Comcast set-top boxes. Those discussions were reportedly put on hold (as were Netflix’s talks with Time Warner about the same thing) when Comcast acquired Time Warner for $45 billion. Meanwhile, Comcast has reportedly been working on a video-on-demand service that could “out-Netflix Netflix.”Last month, Netflix and Comcast announced a deal in which Netflix will pay for direct access to Comcast’s subscribers. Net neutrality rules are meant to ensure that all digital content companies receive equal access to bandwidth. The problem is that Netflix is a notorious bandwidth hog, so Netflix’s deal with Comcast is not actually paying for prioritization. Rather, Netflix is paying to deliver its content directly to consumers rather than going through middlemen, like Cogent Communications. Essentially, it’s getting a direct route to Comcast Internet subscribers rather than driving on the same crowded freeway with all the other schmucks. Confirmed: Comcast to buy Time Warner Cable for $45BDeal will combine the top two cable providers, and alter the media landscape in the United StatesFinancial trends and news by Steven Loeb

The best in streaming entertainment, from the experts.Use commas to separate multiple email addressesYour message has been sent.There was an error emailing this page.As expected, Netflix’s deal with Comcast has produced a bump in speeds for the streaming video service.In February, Netflix streaming speeds averaged 1.68 Mbps on Comcast, compared to 1.51 Mbps in February. It’s not a huge leap, but it’s the first sign of improvement after Netflix began paying Comcast for a direct connection late last month. Netflix said in a blog post that it expects Comcast to move up in the rankings starting next month.Netflix has become noticeably slower on major Internet service providers, amid escalating disputes over how Netflix’s huge amounts of traffic should be handled. In many cases, Netflix pays third-party transit providers to deliver traffic from their networks to ISPs such as Comcast. Typically, no money changes hands in these “peering” arrangements between transit providers and ISPs, but because Netflix is responsible for so much incoming traffic, ISPs feel they should be paid by Netflix’s transit providers to add more capacity.Under Netflix’s deal with Comcast, Netflix servers sit in the same data centers that connect to Comcast’s network, effectively cutting out the third-party transit provider. Although Netflix traffic doesn’t get special treatment on the network, the direct connection should still result in better service. (Dan Rayburn at StreamingMedia.com has an detailed explanation of how this works. He also points out that Netflix isn’t paying a new cost, but is simply paying a different provider, so the overall cost to Netflix may be negligible.)Meanwhile, Netflix’s average speeds continue to decline on Verizon FiOS, Verizon DSL and AT&T DSL, while AT&T U-Verse speeds improved slightly. Both AT&T and Verizon are also seeking payments from Netflix, as Ars Technica points out.Comcast subscribers can now get the first season of House of Cards through their cable box.Although Netflix and Comcast now appear to be living in harmony, that’s not stopping Comcast from trying to give Netflix customers a way out. Under a deal with Sony Pictures, Comcast subscribers can soon buy the first season of the hit Netflix series House of Cards through their cable boxes. Another popular Netflix original, Orange is the New Black, will become available to Comcast subscribers in May, Variety reports.Until now, Netflix has been the only place to watch House of Cards without purchasing the entire first season on DVD. But because Comcast’s deal only covers season one, subscribers will still need a Netflix subscription to see how Frank Underwood’s latest schemes play out. Update: Individual episodes of House of Cards are already available from other sources such as Amazon and iTunes.Jared writes for PCWorld and TechHive from his remote outpost in Cincinnati.TechHive helps you find your tech sweet spot.

692	"Last month, Netflix agreed to pay Comcast for faster access to the cable company’s internet subscribers, allowing users to stream content like the Netflix original series House of Cards at more reliable speeds. How is Comcast repaying them? By licensing the political drama series directly from Sony Pictures so that anyone with Xfinity On Demand cable can watch the show without paying Netflix anything.So far, Comcast subscribers will only be able to watch season one of House of Cards on demand, but they also have plans to add the first season of Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black on May 13th, through a separate deal with Lionsgate. Season two of House of Cards, which went up on Netflix in its entirety on February 14th can’t be far behind. While Netflix will still holds the online streaming rights for House of Cards, Sony is in charge of “home video” distribution, which in 2014 means programs like this one with Comcast. The show will be available in the Xfinity Store as soon as Tuesday, March 11th for purchase and can be viewed on traditional television, online or on mobile through the Xfinity app in iOS or Android devices.UPDATE (2:50pm ET): According to a representative from Comcast, House of Cards season one will not be available in the Xfinity Store for another approximately 30 days. However, the Oscar-nominated film American Hustle, which Comcast also acquired in its deal with Sony, will be available for purchase on demand starting tomorrow, Tuesday, March 11th.[photo via Netflix]— —>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on TwitterHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.comHave a tip or story idea?

693	"Comcast Cable CEO Neil Smit said at a industry conference Monday that the cable giant has signed an electronic sell-through (EST) deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, a pact that will allow Comcast customers to purchase the first season of popular series “House of Cards” and early release movies via their set-top boxes.Smit made the announcement at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom conference in Palm Beach, Fla. Monday. The Sony deal, which includes current movies like “American Hustle” (available March 11) and “Captain Philips,” complements existing EST agreements the cable giant has with LionsGate Entertainment (for movies and series like season one of “Orange is the New Black”), Twenty-First Century Fox, Warner Bros., and sister company NBC Universal. Comcast has said in the past it has had considerable success in electronic sell-through with movies like ""Despicable Me 2,"" ""Fast and Furious 6"" and ""The Hunger Games.""At the DB conference, Smit said the value of EST is in its currency – the movies are available after their release in theaters but ""several weeks"" before the traditional DVD window – and the convenience of ordering through their remote controls.House of Cards has been available for sale through other outlets like Amazon.com, Walmart.com and Verizon FiOs. Now Comcast can add its name to the list. “The Sony Pictures library is a terrific addition to our rapidly expanding offering of hit films and TV shows available for purchase,” said Comcast senior vice president of content acquisition Michael Schreiber in a statement. “The response to the digital store has been encouraging and tells us our customers love the flexibility and ease of purchasing content directly from Xfinity On Demand to watch when and where they want it.”Smit said that Comcast continues to  assemble content rights, focusing on three areas: live linear programming, current seasons of shows and library content. He added that on the VOD side, Comcast disables the fast-forward function so content owners can get the full effect of C3 ratings for new shows and earlier episodes.“But in return we want the full current season,” he said.  Later, Smit said that Comcast continues to work with several MSOs regarding licensing of its X1 operating platform.      View the discussion thread.Subscribe to our FREE eNewslettersThe Internet Association, whose members include theFulfilling a rumor that surfaced about three monthsContinued queasiness over the potential for higherPhoto galleries of industry leaders, events and celebrities.Copyright © 2018 by NewBay Media, LLC.

	With a click of a button in the Xfinity Store, Comcast subscribers will soon be able to purchase access to House of Cards — Netflix is not required. The option should hit the service soon. Only the first season of the show is currently available.Variety is reporting today that the Emmy-winning series is available through a deal Comcast struck with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The news comes from Neil Smit, Comcast Cable president and CEO, speaking today at Deutsche Bank’s 2014 Media, Internet and Telecom Conference.“Orange is the New Black” will be available on the Xfinity Store on May 13th through a similar deal with Lionsgate.The price, if there is one, is not noted in the Variety report.The deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment also provides new movies to Comcast subscribers. “American Hustle” drops tomorrow. “Breaking Bad,” “Captain Phillips,” “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2,” “The Amazing Spider-Man” and “21 Jump Street” all hit Comcast’s streaming service in the coming weeks.The Xfinity Store launched in November as a sort of answer to Netflix and Amazon Instant video. Like its counterparts Xfinity Store offers on-demand video streaming on a variety of devices but it’s limited to just Comcast subscribers. Content is available for purchase and rental although there is free content on it as well.Latest headlines delivered to you daily"	Entertainment

In the end, the naysayers who accused HBOs True Detective of being sexist seem mostly irrelevant. Yes, it would be nice to see more top-notch hour-long dramas created by women and concerning women, particularly more women of color. But thats not what True Detective was intended to do.



At its heart, this was a story of male friendship, transcending macho rivalry and frat boy cavorting to ultimately be about guys saving each other.



A mystery wrapped in a religious cult conspiracy, slowly unfolded by two antiheroes  one a lying adulterer, the other an addict with pretentious theories about the meaning of life  ultimately was a male drama. The mission involved saving little girls, balancing the loss of one of the detectives little girl. But women didnt figure in, except as a plot twist to establish the two detectives antipathy.



Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey deserve applause, the creepy littered overgrown and horrific compound where the endgame played out deserves a nod for set design; T Bone Burnett deserves praise for the moody, even otherworldly music. But storywise, the eight episodes of this anthology series involved too many leaps and loopholes. The misdirection concerning the suspected pedophile priest, the Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle, was just confusing. How did he die? What did it matter?

Much of the gumshoes discovery happened by luck and chance rather than logic. Green ears? Green paint? A painter! The sudden rush of clues, leading neatly to the serial killer via work permits and job orders via computer, felt a bit pat after all the soul-searching, existential doubt and flashback interviewing.



The final scenes, with McConaughey dressed, positioned and coiffed to look like Jesus Christ, suggested more profundity than the show actually offered. Looking to the night sky for cosmic truths, Hart (Harrelson) and Cohle (McConaughey) again slip away from the authority figures (this time, its the hospital) to go it alone. Together.



Its all about good versus evil, light versus dark, Cohle concluded, and the lights winning.



Moody, unnerving, confusing  but surprisingly optimistic.



HBO Go crash



Meanwhile, the light may have been ascendant, but the electrons werent cooperating: The HBO Go streaming service collapsed, unable to feed demand for the finale Sunday. The network promptly scheduled a rerun, and the service on HBO cable was unaffected. The twitterverse had a field day (sample tweet: Congratulations to #TrueDetective for being the first show to literally break @HBOGO).

Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey deserve applause, the creepy littered overgrown and horrific compound where the endgame played out deserves a nod for set design; T Bone Burnett deserves praise for the moody, even otherworldly music. But storywise, the eight episodes of this anthology series involved too many leaps and loopholes. The misdirection concerning the suspected pedophile priest, the Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle, was just confusing. How did he die? What did it matter?

696	"The first season of True Detective has wound to a close, and we've been introduced to a villain who almost defies definition. Simply put, ________ is a monster, and a king of monsters.Some may want to stamp Errol Childress with the label of redneck, or hillbilly trash. I fear those crude words cannot capture him. His proper introduction in the finale is a medley of contradictions. He is intelligent and crude at the same time. Beastly and— when it amuses him— urbane.Let us focus a moment on his voice— or rather, voices. Thomas Harris' own Clarice Starling did everything in her power to lose her West Virginia accent, afraid it would paint her as white trash. Errol dances from voice to voice without apparent effort. While his scars are unfortunate, he has no problems passing as pleasant, humble, and likable in public. He is a chameleon. He chooses to remain where he is, the Yellow King of Carcosa. And that choice makes him horrifying.Errol is in good company with fictional killers that seek transformation. But the quests of Jame Gumb and Francis Dolarhyde (again, from the works of Thomas Harris) have urgency. They're possessed of a pressing need to complete their task. Childress speaks of his own journey with fondness— almost as an errand he'll get to when he finds the time. Gumb and Dolarhyde were desperate to change, to grow, to be something other. Childress has been working toward his ascension for years, if not decades. He has all the time in the world.On the state of his house: While his home is cluttered with filth, yes, think about his needs: He has very few. He has a lover who tends to his needs and fears him. His own personal labyrinth is in walking distance. His day job makes him all but invisible, and keeps him close to his prey. He wants for nothing.Beyond the damage done to him in his formative years, consider the possibility that everything about this creature is a deliberate choice. The state of his house, his sloven appearance. He lives in a veritable sty, but strides through it like royalty. For all intents and purposes, it pleases him to be this. Such low beginnings make his ""ascension"" all the more meaningful.AdvertisementOur minotaur delivers his last words to his father— a man he has every reason to hate— with dissonant serenity. He leads his prey into his labyrinth where he taunts them with a voice from the depths of hell. He unnerves them with his works. He very nearly kills them both.Errol Childress is a masterpiece of foulness. I sincerely hope we do not see his like again anytime soon. He will linger in nightmares— Rust Cohle's, Martin Hart's, and mine."	Entertainment

 BY ZACH TILLY | MARCH 11, 2014 5:00 AMThe first season of HBO’s pitch-dark serial-killer anthology “True Detective” tied up a few of its loose ends in its Sunday night finale, though its creator Nic Pizzolatto insisted from the start that the audience need not wait to see the mystery solved — all the necessary clues were coded into the show from the very first episode.It’s a strange way to begin a basketball commentary, yes, but here’s my point: Had we employed the same Talmudic scholarship as fans devoted to “True Detective,” we might have been able to foretell the collapse of the Iowa basketball team before such a turn seemed possible.Indeed, I’d suggest that the details crucial to understanding Iowa’s 1-5 finish were foreshadowed in its loss to Villanova in November.Remember that at the time of the Battle 4 Atlantis title game, Villanova was seen as something of a disappointing consolation prize for an Iowa team that wanted a shot at Kansas. Yes, Villanova turned out to be great, but Iowa was done in, ultimately, by its own still-untreated pathologies. Against ’Nova, Iowa started hot — it led by 12 with 11-and-a-half minutes to go — but fell into what has become the hallmark of an Iowa second half, the colossal scoring drought. A 55-43 Iowa lead at the 11:10 mark was a 64-57 Villanova lead seven minutes later, after a 21-2 run in crunch time.To extrapolate: Iowa led by 2 at Michigan State at halftime before being thoroughly dismantled by two separate 9-0 runs in the second half. The Hawkeyes led by 7 at Indiana with 15:54 left and promptly gave up a 9-0 run. They didn’t score a single field goal between a Melsahn Basabe put-back at the 9:50 mark and a Mike Gesell jumper with 1:10 remaining, when the game was already out of hand.At Minnesota, Iowa went from 13:42 to 8:04 without a field goal, a stretch during which Minnesota increased its lead from 2 points to 13.Same story against Illinois. Fran McCaffery’s crew led by 6 at 11:26, and by their next basket over five minutes later, they’d given up an 11-0 run.This particular symptom points to any number of causes: a lack of go-to scoring, the sloppiness that inevitably follows when Devyn Marble starts pressing in tight games. It’s perhaps a lack of mental toughness or poor adjustments and poor lineup management, particularly from the under-12 media time-out to the under-8 stoppage, when Fran tends to turn to his second line. The persistence of these droughts indicates a complex set of deficiencies unlikely to be cracked in the next week.That Villanova game also highlighted Iowa’s inability to guard 3-point shooters in close games. The Wildcats’ Ryan Arcidiacono hit two go-ahead 3s in the last minute to send the game to overtime and then assisted on two more 3s to give Villanova the early lead in overtime.Bad luck, one might argue, but Iowa has been burned too many times for its inability to get late stops to be a coincidence.Of course, there was Jon Ekey’s game winner for Illinois on Sunday, but also Josh Gasser’s crunch-time 3s in Wisconsin’s win at Carver. On Jan. 28, Russell Byrd’s improbable but undefended overtime dagger for Michigan State sent the Iowa fans home with their first of several devastating home losses.In fairness, though, those defensive shortcomings aren’t unique to crunch-time 3-point shooting. They were also run out of the gym by Minnesota’s athletic guards and an Indiana team that had been, prior to Iowa’s arrival, anemic.We learned from the Villanova game a lot about Iowa’s personnel use as well. Limited contributions in the Bahamas from Jarrod Uthoff, Peter Jok, and Anthony Clemmons — even before Josh Oglesby returned from his foot injury — forewarned that Iowa’s highly touted 11-man depth was exaggerated. In reality, the Hawkeyes’ depth proved to be mostly a Dackichian talking point — they’ve looked absolutely gassed of late and the late-conference rotation has actually featured nine guys with an occasional sprinkling of Clemmons.There were other clues, too — inconsistent frontcourt play, for example — but maybe, in the end, the mystery of the Hawkeyes will conclude with a revelation similar to that of “True Detective”: the truth — that Iowa was but a slightly improved team with a tougher schedule, doomed to another 20-11 (9-9) finish — was right under our noses all along.

And just like that, Rust Cohle and Martin Hart have disappeared from the psychosphere of our television sets, with HBO airing the final episode of “True Detective” season one last night. And everyone was watching. In fact, so many people hit the network’s HBO GO service that it crashed, leaving many fans looking at an endless load sign, as they took to the Internet to voice their fury. But by now, fans have caught up with the fate of Rust and Martin and their search for The Yellow King, and are left with that feeling of what to do next.Well, we’ve got a solution that will hopefully hold you over until details of the second season emerge—all the music from “True Detective” season one. Unlike “Girls,” where music forms a part of the package that’s being sold around the show, the tunes in “True Detective” have always been about texture. In fact, it’s so deeply woven, we truly didn’t realize at the time that we were hearing songs by Wu-Tang Clan or School Of Seven Bells or Father John Misty. Indeed, the choices have been part of a fabric that includes lots of blues, gospel and old timey country.






So, if you’re sitting at home or in the office today and want to experience “True Detective” all over again, the songs below will be good ones to spin. Take a listen… Opening: The Handsome Family “Far From Any Road”Episode 1: “The Long Bright Dark”

For over fifteen years a conspiracy and myth has haunted Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson), one involving a yellow king, a man with scars and the mysterious destination of Carcosa. An evil had spread its branches across Louisiana, something pervasive, powerful and for the longest time untouchable. The name of God was used as a cover for unspeakable crimes and killings, and Rust, Martin and anyone else who touched that darkness, found it touching them right back. “All my life I wanted to be nearer to God. The only nearness? Silence,” Joel Theriot (Shea Whigham) said in episode six, “Haunted Houses.” But in “Form And Void,” that silence has answers.For much of the season, Rust has largely been presented as the visionary of the detective duo, going about his job with philosophical underpinnings to almost every aspect of an investigation. His interrogation technique is unparalleled, and even as Martin chased skirts and avoided the problems in his marriage, Rust followed up on every lead and kept digging. The widening gap between the pair tore them apart, however, watching Rust and Martin come back together has been one of the greatest satisfactions of the final act of the show. “I find it touching when Cohle asks about Marty’s life—that’s something ‘95 Cohle would never do,” Nic Pizzolatto told Buzzfeed about a scene in episode seven, “After You’ve Gone.”  And indeed, Rust and Martin have never been more simpatico than they are here.






“The story was entirely planned around them reuniting to try and resolve this serial murderer case,” Pizzolatto also said, and there is something poetic about watching Rust and Martin working so well together here. In 2012, it’s Martin’s investigation techniques and intuition that lead the detectives from Steve Geraci’s (Michael Harvey) revelations about the “chain of command” above him who hushed up the Marie Fonteneau case, to the home of Errol Childress aka The Man With Scars. He lives in squalor, speaks of “acension” and there is a sense he’s long been prepared to make one final stand for his life’s work of murder. And Rust knows they finally found his man, thanks to his synaesthesia. “That taste, aluminum, ash….I tasted it before…,” he intones with gravity before they get there. And it’s a taste that nearly brings them to their demise.Errol leads Rust into Carcosa, an underground warren of tunnels, twigs and branches, with Martin following his partner a bit of a distance behind. He’s been busy trying to find a phone to call  Detective Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) to send backup. And after being taunted in the darkness, Rust comes face-to-face with Errol in a clearing, but he’s first distracted by a hole revealing the night sky above, one that in his eyes becomes a swirling void. It’s almost as if Rust has made peace with ending his life (remember, he once said, “My life’s been a circle of violence and degradation, as long as I can remember. I’m ready to tie it off”), and with Childress attacking him by surprise, that nearly happens. Rust is deeply wounded in the gut, before Martin arrives to help only to get critically wounded as well. And as Errol towers over Martin to finish him off, it’s Rust who springs into action with what he has left, to shoot Errol in the head. In the distance the police arrives, a flare is sent up as beacon of hope to Rust and Martin (a beautiful visual moment) and it looks like case closed.






But this is where “True Detective” becomes so much more than just a procedural concerned with finding the killer (who was revealed anyway, in last week’s “After You’ve Gone”). When Detective Maynard Gilbough (Michael Potts) and Papania come to visit Martin in the hospital to share details of what their investigation has discovered about Childress, the Lake Charles murder and the web of people involved, he waves them off. Martin would prefer not to know. And as the audience hears via news reports, it looks like the Tuttle family will remain unscathed too. So what was this all about then, if not the killers? Mortality and meaning, perhaps, among other things. “It’s just one story, the oldest,” Rust says about everything that’s happened. “Light versus dark.” And Martin replies, “…it appears to me, dark has a lot more territory.”And it’s a bit of a role reversal, and a fitting view for Martin who this long on the job, has seen the worst the world has to offer. But In 1995, it would’ve likely been Rust to side with such a dark view of humanity, but something changed him. In a coma following surgery after getting stabbed by Errol Childress, Rust reveals to Martin that during that time, he not only felt the presence of his daughter, but her love too. “And then I woke up,” he says in tears. “Death is not the answer, rejoice” an elderly woman declared in last week’s episode, and now Rust knows it himself. “If you ask me, light’s winning,” he tells Martin before the credits roll. And it’s a beautiful moment in a show that ends on a note of hope, instead of a neatly tied resolution. And it’s stronger for it. “True Detective” has never put the mystery first, and it’s something telling that the weakest episode of the season was also the most straightforward, “After You’ve Gone.” Instead the show is about two men, one presented in darkness, who after losing his family, plunged headfirst into the darkest corners of his job, and the other a seemingly happy family man.And the darkness of the case consumed them in different ways. Martin continually edged away from his family into bad habits, while Rust had an outlet for the sense of injustice he felt at God or the world or whoever was in charge of damning him to his fate of pain and loss. But the pair’s trajectory found them trading places. What Martin saw on a continual basis of the force, caused him to drop the job. Whatever traditional notions about police work he might’ve had were eradicated by the details of this case. For Martin, that’s why the “dark has a lot more territory.” But for Rust, the mere fact that love can sustain as strongly as it does in his heart for his daughter, and having his own ideas turned around about the finality of death, gives him enough hope to start seeing the edges of light on the horizon.It’s a moving and soulful closer to “True Detective,” which has solidified itself as one of the best shows of the year. Nic Pizzolatto created a rich, intelligent, dangerous but beautifully textured world. Far more than just an eight episode procedural, “True Detective” is about what happens when horror comes to our doorstep, and the people we become after that encounter.

701	"True Detective S01E08: ""Form and Void"" Going into ""Form and Void,"" there were a lot of ways to describe the first season of True Detective: stunning, raw, philosophical, frightening, pretentious, ambitious, boobies, occasionally hilarious, gorgeous, and incomplete. And coming out of the finale, nothing really changed about those adjectives. ""Form and Void"" was a very good but not great ending to one of the better new shows to come around in a long time, but I can't help but think the show peaked around Episode 5—the mind-bending and perfect ""The Secret Life of All Fate"" that threatened to be the first major step in a new post-Golden Age of television renaissance—and since then has been merely a great detective show. That's probably not fair to True Detective to approach it in that manner, but I mean it when I say ""great television show."" True Detective was astounding television, even when it shifted away from what I thought was its strengths.For me, it's impossible to look at ""Form and Void"" individually as an hour. True Detective was this idea of ""event television"" that other 
networks are chasing. It was eight episodes of a new property that made 
its viewers theorize and dive in headfirst into an empty pool of obsession. ""Form and Void"" was the end of a really long movie to me because Season 1 was self-contained with a beginning, middle, end, and no chance of more, unlike 22-or-even-13-episode seasons that contain filler and cliffhangers and could live on in syndication for your grandkids. And because it was the end of the story rather than a regular season finale, I found it incredibly satisfying as an endpoint even if it wasn't the best part of the season. It ended about as perfectly as it could end. Hart and Cohle got their man in Erroll Childress, a man whose hygiene and sex life was just as frightening as his remorseless acts of murder, but they didn't bust up the bigger sex-cult child-pornography old man's club that was certainly connected to the Tuttle family and responsible for all these missing girls. True Detective was never a happy show, it focused on the worst of us in the worst of times. It's consistent with the show's theme that Hart and Cohle only put a Band-Aid on Louisiana's gusher of a declining young woman population, and realized they they ""didn't get 'em all,"" and weren't going to get them all. But they did get the monster at the end of their nightmare, and the series portrayed this as a realistic victory. For the viewer who demands closure, this probably didn't work. The idea that Billy Lee Tuttle is still out there and pulling up a van with no windows next to a schoolgirl right now is unsettling, but that's the point. True Detective wants you to leave Season 1 feeling that this battle between light and dark, good and evil, the Rust Cohles of the universe and the fat, incestuous Erolls of the universe isn't done because True Detective isn't afraid to show the harsh truth of the world. The paradox of the world needing bad men (""The world needs bad men,"" came straight from Rust's mouth early in the season) in order to have good men was all over True Detective, and watching those lines get reluctantly drawn is what really made the arcs of Hart and Cohle so interesting.But it was the final minutes of ""Form and Void"" that saw those lines firmly etched into the ground. Our two men were still recovering from their battle wounds in the hospital when True Detective delivered an oddball of a twist ending that I don't think anyone expected. Rust Cohle went sentimental on us! Cohle's near-death experience had a profound effect on his psyche, and as Cohle sat in his wheelchair looking like he just got out of a meat grinder, he told Marty that he was looking at his night-sky metaphor (light vs. dark) all wrong. ""Once there was only dark,"" he said, peering up at the faint stars. ""If you ask me, the light's winning."" Rust Cohle, the man who could look at a puppy and only see a trip to the vet to put the dog down in 12 years, had hope. HOPE! Cohle's words were captured on the season's final shot, a long hold on the night sky as stars shone brighter and brighter. It was almost enough to draw a tear. Almost. I'm not entirely sure that ending worked, but I give True Detective an A-plus for effort and I loved how it broke expectations. When I think about how I will remember Rust Cohle, one of television's best characters of all time, it will be the man who amassed a beer-can-man army as his minions against his interrogators. It will be the man who spoke of flat circles, bad men, and suicide suggestions. His final revelation of hope will be a footnote in my memory even though it shouldn't be, and I'm not sure if it's because I'm enamored with the Rust Cohle of old (1995 and 2002, specifically) or if it's because I want True Detective to be that dark, Nihilistic show that thrilled me through the first five or six episodes. And maybe it's because I'm not entirely sure I even believe him. It could be the pain meds talking for all I know. It's just an abrupt turn to take everything we knew about a man—Rust was defined by that fatalistic attitude—and spin it on its head in a series' final minute. But gosh darnit, it still warmed my heart even if it was sudden and cheesy. I like to think Cohle took that positive attitude straight to the nearest watering hole and put down a celebratory six pack of Lone Star.The ending may give us a little insight as to what's coming in future seasons. I'm just guessing here, but what if future seasons of True Detective all existed in the same universe, and really, there's no reason they couldn't, and told similar stories of how the job affected people in different ways? Did you ever read Cloud Atlas (ignore the movie, it's awful)? It's one of my favorite books, and I think True Detective could do something similar with its structure as it moves forward. Cloud Atlas takes place over several different time periods with recurring themes and images popping up in several short stories. It would make sense that Season 1 of True Detective, which focused more on existential themes rather than homicide investigations, would carry over similar ideas into Season 2's brand-new setting and characters. Cohle's last-minute ray of sunshine could just be the beginning of this war between light and dark. I'm not saying that every season will end with a formerly disenchanted detective saying, ""If you ask me, the light's winning,"" but I could easily imagine it ending with another small victory. ""We ain't gonna get them all, that ain't what kind of world it is, but we got ours,"" Marty said. Maybe True Detective really is a show about good prevailing over evil, about believing that the world isn't one huge garbage dump rotting away at the core, about understanding that you can only do your part to help the light. Maybe, when True Detective Season 14 ends and Zac Efron shares a sunrise with Ashton Kutcher, we'll see True Detective for what it really was: a show about changing your outlook for the better. That's the only way I can understand Cohle's sudden reversal of perspective fitting in with the rest of the series. (That, or another main character has the exact opposite trajectory as Cohle's and the two meet in a later season as a superhero and supervillain and we realize Season 1 was just preamble to a Captain Cohle summer blockbuster movie franchise.) But I still call ""Form and Void"" ""good but not great"" because it didn't quite match up with the meaty and mysterious middle of Season 1, which I thought (and prayed) True Detective would take all the way to the end. Episodes 3, 4, and 5 were revelatory television that played with narrative structure, time, and character. Earlier in Season 1 I tweeted out that True Detective had consumed me, but once the interrogations with Gilbough and Papania ended, True Detective burped me up. I loved the idea of not knowing what was the truth, on relying on potentially unreliable narrators, of fitting the puzzle pieces together to figure out what had happened and what made Hart and Cohle who they were in the present. Episodes 7 and 8 shed that mystery so that all we saw was truth. I hate to penalize a show for being so great at one point, but that run of True Detective episodes were SO good that it made the last three hours look somewhat tame by comparison. And tame is indeed a relative term, for ""Form and Void"" contained the scariest sequence of the series by far. Cohle's frantic gangland exit at the end of ""Who Goes There"" remains the season's pièce de résistance, but Cohle and Hart navigating Childress' twig maze was more intense given the uncertainty of it all. And that's what these last two episodes did have over the first six. We didn't know if Hart or Cohle would die because we were in real time. Even as soon as Hart and Cohle pulled up to Childress' hoarder house, the air in the room changed. There's a shot of the car facing us with that little shed in the background, and you just knew something horrible was going on in there. Cohle knew it, too, and immediately told Hart to call Papania for backup because ""this is the place."" True Detective does so many things so well, but my favorite is it's mastery of suspense and the way it can seamlessly transition into action. ""Marty clear the house!"" was our starter-gun for a 10-minute sequence of heart-racing in this one, and it was impossible to do anything but inch forward on the couch and be mesmerized by the backwoods labyrinth, the effective use and non-use of sound, and gorgeous cinematography. I've probably changed my mind on ""Form and Void"" a dozen times since watching it, wavering between various degrees of positivity, but I'm noticing that the more I think about it, the more I like it. Right now, it's very, very good, but tomorrow it could be three ""very""s and by the time Season 2 ends, it could be the best ever as it finds another puzzle piece to snap into.  – Sorry for the delay on this! No screener plus a newborn baby means my schedule is all over the place. – This show, more than any I've ever seen, was in grave danger of being ruined by the Internet (and some could easily argue that it was). I never understood why it was picked apart as ravenously as it was with viewers looking for clues to the case and theorizing twists and even a supernatural component. To me, it had always been a more straightforward show that understood that creating bad people who could live within the realm of our known universe was much scarier than anything supernatural. – However, I do understand disappointment from those who needed every question answered. Online speculation created most of those questions though. I never cared about Marty's daughter's figurines or the picture of the Five Horsemen or even Carcosa and the idea of The Yellow King, but the Internet sure did. I think I saved myself a lot of frustration by not getting sucked into the conspiracy hunt and instead watching True Detective for the characters more than the case. – And because True Detective was the focus of so much 
watercooler discussion, it felt like ""Form and Void"" almost hit a point 
of self parody at some moments, where I got sucked into over-adrenalized
 file sorting or digging into tax records, or watched just waiting for 
Cohle to say something weird instead of letting these characters be 
themselves. LIke Marty's ""What's scented meat?"" punchline, which made me
 think more of a buddy cop comedy than anything else. – The big break in the case being a house that was painted green decades ago and Marty figuring out that the Spaghetti Monster's green ears were linked to it was pretty lame! Sorry, but it was! But an interesting investigation was never one of True Detective's strong points. – Cohle might have the new outlook on life, but I worry for Marty. He's a broken man who has nothing left to do but go back to microwave TV dinners. However, he seemed pretty happy to be sucking on that sippy cup in the hospital.– Speaking of that scene, that back and forth between Hart and Cohle was fantastic. Hart: ""What's your problem?"" Cohle, barely alive: ""Nothing, what's your problem."" Hart: ""Don't ever change, man."" *flips the bird* And Cohle responded in kind. – I love the sequences of stitching together the gorgeous landscape shots to show how the land was all connected and spotted with sites of evil. Erroll's home, the bayou, the Ledoux meth compound, the river, the site of Dora Lange's murder. It all resonated as a complete landscape and nifty reminder of where we've been. And, if you're pessimistic, what might still be out there. – I don't normally do this, but a hearty thank you to all those involved in the series for making it such a fantastic watch. This was top-notch entertainment and an extraordinary effort from very talented people. – ""Making flowers""? Did you perverts ever think that maybe they were referring to putting together some great bouquets? "	Entertainment
702	It seems one potential drawback of mixing a critically acclaimed show and streaming media is the potential to crash servers.HBO concluded the first season of True Detective last night, but those that chose to watch it through HBO Go, the cable service’s online portal, may still be waiting as you read this. There were plenty of tweets from disgruntled users last night as they took photos of loading screens that just kept spinning endlessly as it tried to load the final episode. HBO finally commented as the complaining increased.Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.— HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014While annoying for users, possibly some of whom aren’t even HBO subscribers, it’s also an interesting sign for the state of streaming media. This is now a go-to source of viewing for shows that have even just aired, and for a commercial-free service such as HBO, it really doesn’t matter whether someone watches the show on traditional television or through an app. But when you have a show take off the way True Detective did, I’m willing to bet HBO wishes more people had watched it traditionally.Considering the service has been around for a little over four years now and this is its first major outage, that’s a pretty good track record. We’re sure the company will be taking a long, hard look at its infrastructure this week with the fourth season of Game of Thrones just about to launch. But if you encounter problems, perhaps just decide Wednesday night is your HBO night instead of trying to crush in right after the episode has aired.Sean P.

703	After eight mystery-starting, meme-generating, McConaissance-confirming episodes, the first season of HBO’s True Detective has finally reached its conclusion. As we approached the end of the saga of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, tensions ran high. Would they finally solve the mystery of the Yellow King? Was last week’s revelation a confirmation of the killer’s identity, or a red herring? Could it be that the whole thing just one of Rust’s acid traps? And of course, the most important question of all: CARCOSA WTF? Well, the season is over. And now we know everything…or at least, as much as we’ll ever know. SPOILERS FROM HERE:(UPDATE: Click here for our critic Jeff Jensen’s take on the finale.) Did True Detective have a happy ending? That might sounds like a strange description of an hour of television that prominently featured one of the freakier psychopaths to grace the small screen, the final revelation of Carcosa the Terror Temple, a druggy vision of what appeared to be an Event Horizon wormhole to hell, and both protagonists stabbed with various stabby weapons. But given the season of gloom that preceded it, the season finale of True Detective ended on a note of veritable optimism. “Once there was only dark,” said Rust Cohle The Nihilist Anti-hero as a closing line/epitaph. “You ask me, light’s winning.”It took some time to get there. The boys finally managed to track down Errol Childress the Lawnmower Man. (With a hat tip to Marty: He’s the one who finally connected the whole “green-eared spaghetti monster” description to a new coat of green paint on a house from the old Dora Lange case.) That led Rust and Marty out to Errol’s house, which he shared with his aunt/girlfriend and his decaying dead father.They chased him into what appeared to be some kind of overgrown ruined temple — or maybe there was some actual infrastructural use for it, in the days before it became a palace of all manner of satanic terror. “This is Carcosa,” intoned Errol. Rust had a vision straight out of a Guillermo Del Toro movie of a cosmic event in the darkness…and then Errol attacked. He stabbed Rust, and would have killed him…if Rust hadn’t used his Nihilist Headbutt Super Attack. That gave Marty enough time to shoot Errol a couple times. At which point Errol threw what appeared to be a tomahawk Marty’s chest. Marty barely survived — but Rust finally put the bad man down, shooting him in the head.Rust looked halfway dead, and Martin not much better. But shockingly, they both survived. Rust seemed disappointed. They hadn’t tracked down every member of the Tuttle family, after all. “We ain’t gonna get them all,” said Marty. “That ain’t the kind of world it is. But we got ours.” Rust, despondent, explained that he didn’t think he belonged on this world. When he was near-death, he had a vision — of his daughter, his father, his dead loved ones. “It was like I was a part of everything I ever loved,” he said, near tears and then beyond them. Was this whole show about Rust learning to accept his daughter’s death? Learning to be human again? Marty guided him away from the hospital, half-carrying him.It was a lot to take in — an hour that veered more towards philosophy than final-act thrills (although it had plenty of that, as well.) Check out our TV critic Jeff Jensen’s take on the finale.	Entertainment
704	For me, True Detective ticked boxes that no other television show could. The Wire was the closest show that came close to bringing the same amount of depth, and that was a different kind of depth.Lots of anger was expressed for the ending, but also large praise; from what I've seen, you either loved it or hated it. It's difficult for a show to steal the crown of your favorite show, but I have a hunch that HBO's latest converted many.If True Detective did become your new favorite television show, why?If True Detective didn't become your new favorite television show, why not?

Now he is introducing his solution: PonoMusic, a combination online music store and playback system that gives listeners access to audiophile quality recordings.“It’s about the music, real music,” the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member said in a statement released Monday, a day before he formally introduces PonoMusic at the South by Southwest Music Conference in Austin. “We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does exactly that.”The complaint about that way most music is experienced by consumers today is that highly compressed MP3 files that make it convenient to store on phones and share over the Internet compromise the quality of sound, since MP3 files typically contain 5 percent or less of the sonic information in the original master recordings.“Apple has made music into wallpaper, so what can I tell you?” Young told the Los Angeles Times in 2009.PonoMusic will give consumers a convenient way to download and play back full-resolution files.Young has noted that all three major music groups — Warner Bros., Universal and Sony — are participating in the PonoMusic online music store. The PonoPlayer will have a list price of $399 and be capable of storing 1,000 to 2,000 high-resolution digital albums, according to the PonoMusic statement.

706	True Detective wrapped its celebrated, intensely parsed first season last night with a finale that has invited a wide variety of reactions. Your opinion might hinge on whether or not you found the revelation of The Yellow King — Errol Childress, aka The Lawnmower Man — and his evil to be interesting and a surprisingly uplifting, optimistic ending for Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) to be the correct call for the series.  The man behind the madness stands behind his choices, although the writer (best known before this for the crime novel Galveston) sounds a bit relieved that the roller coaster ride of his first major work for television has reached its conclusion.  “Our long national nightmare is over!” laughs Nic Pizzolatto, jumping on the phone not long after the east coasting airing, and before watching the finale with his family and music supervisor T. Bone Burnett at McConaughey’s house. In this brief interview, Pizzolatto discusses his endgame vision, clarifies Errol’s master plan, and teases season 2 of True Detective — and the future of Cohle and Hart.ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So let’s talk about the twist ending: Rust Cohle and Marty Hart walk away from this alive. I was not expecting that. I also wasn’t expecting that we’d get to see them process the experience to the extent that they did. And then there was the strong note of optimism at the end. Why did you want to end this story this way?NIC PIZZOLATTO: A few reasons. We’re never going to spend time with these guys again. And killing characters on television has become an easy short cut to cathartic emotion. So I thought killing the guys, or having something more mysterious happen to them  – like the guys charged into Errol’s underworld, and disappeared, and nobody knows what happens to them – would have been the same thing if the show had gone full-bore into the supernatural: To me, it would have been puerile, and it would have skirted all the issues the show raised. To me, the challenge was to not only let these guys live, but show true character change through this journey. That passing through the eye of the needle in the heart of darkness has actually done something to them.The challenge was to create an emotionally resonant ending that made the journey worthwhile. And it felt to me like my proper relationship to the characters should end with me allowing them to walk away into some kind of immortal life outside of this show. I mean, it ends with them exiting stage right, right? We don’t know what kind of life they’ll have. But I think we can be sure that each man is more willing to acknowledge the presence of grace. That was one of the ways that they both failed the same: Neither man would accommodate the idea of grace for their own reasons. Where I wanted them to go in their journeys wasn’t a point of redemption or conversion or even closure but a point of deliverance. They are not healed, but now, for the first time, you can imagine a future where they are healed. And before that was never a possibility for Cohle and hardly a possibility for Hart. But now it’s a real earned possibility.You closed the show with Cohle talking about the stars – a metaphor for good versus evil, light versus dark – and how as a kid he’d look up at the stars and create stories. All of which reminded me that of storytellers of antiquity, assigning heroic myths to the stars. What was the meaning of that sequence for you?There was a part in the show that wound up getting cut, in which Cohle detailed his childhood in Alaska, and he described having no entertainment, now way to pass the time than to walk around in the night, with his synesthesia, it would seem like he could hear the stars ringing. That was his television show. I think what True Detective keeps telling you, over and over again, is that everything’s a story. Who you tell yourself you are, what you tell yourself what the world is,  an investigation, a religion, a nihilistic point of view – these are all stories you tell yourself. You need to be careful what stories you tell yourself.You said there was no conversion in the story. But was Cohle suggesting he now believes in some kind of afterlife when he told Hart about his near death experience?It’s not a belief – he’s talking about an experience. And he’s not talking about a reconciliation with loved ones after death: If you listen to what he says, he says, ‘I was gone. There was no me. Just love… and then I woke up.’ That line is significant to the whole series: “And then I woke up.” The only thing like a conversion that he has is when he says, “You’re looking at it wrong. To me, the light is winning.” And that doesn’t describe a conversion to me as much as it describes a broadening of perspective. The man who once said there is no light at the end of the tunnel is now saying there might be order to this. I don’t think it says anything more than: Pick your stories carefully.Errol Childress was pungent with rot and weird. What was your philosophy regarding the villain of the show and how you portrayed him in the finale?We had kept the monster behind the curtain and we needed to get to know him. We had showed aspects of the monster and we had showed the historical genesis of the monster or at least provided enough information to describe him. For the finale, I thought the audience deserved to get a close point of view on the monster, and to recognize him the way you recognize the heroes of True Detective. There are no monsters other than humans, no heroes other than humans. The challenge with Errol was to imply an entire history and personal mythology and methodology within the limited amount of time we had with him. Since this was the finale, I thought we could make room for one more point of view, the dark mirror to our characters, the shadow they’ve been chasing for so 17 years without knowing it, the historical victim of bad men who murders women and children.Errol spoke of a rather mysterious, occult agenda: He spoke of aspiring to an “ascension.” What was Errol really up to? What did he want?That’s a really good question, and I don’t know if it benefits me to answer it. We definitely had an idea – I laid out for Glenn Fleshler, who played Errol, and for our art department, in terms of who this killer was, what he was doing, and how he lived. In the beginning, when he says, “My ascension removes me the disc in the loop,” he’s describing the cosmology of eternal recurrence of various characters, including Cohle and Reggie Ledoux hit upon, and he’s hitting upon his personal mythology. When he says, “It’s been weeks since I left my mark, would they have eyes to see,” we can tell from that that he’s angling for a reckoning, for a showdown. He’s waiting for it. He believes the murders ritually enacted over a period of time, upon his death, permit him an ascension that removes him from the Karmic wheel of rebirth. This whole idea of time as a circle, yeah, that’s Nietzsche and quantum cosmology, but that’s also the Karmic wheel. If you mentioned something like Karma to someone like Cohle, he’d probably throw up.So it’s fair to interpret from the finale that Errol wanted death and was inviting it?Yes, he was inviting it.Would it be fair to interpret from the series as a whole that Errol was trying to expose the monsters who made him, his family, by leaving clues that implicated them?Yes. You can tell there are certain times he wants people to notice him. Childress was signaling to the authorities both his presence and the presence of the men who made him. And Cohle and Hart don’t get absolute justice at the end. Cohle says, we didn’t get them all. But they got a branch from a big rotten tree, and Hart says, we got ours, and basically, the rest of the tree is up to other people.Errol seemed to consume a lot of pop culture. He had stacks of DVDs and books and magazine in his house, he watched North by Northwest on television. What was his relationship to it?I had an entire biography for Errol. For example, he taught himself to sound like other people by watching movies on his VCR. That’s why one minute he can sound like Andy Griffith inviting you to the fishing hole, and the next second he sound like James Mason, and then the next, he can sound like something otherworldly. So yeah: if we’re talking about the stories we tell ourselves, if identity is a story, this killer we get to know a little at the end, his identity seems completely fluid, depending on what story needs to be told, or, in the case of the North By Northwest scene, whatever story is in front of him.Are you prepared for the theories or varied wild interpretations that might come with this ending? About four weeks  ago, I realized I had to completely avoid the Internet. So I am going to just keep doing that. Once it really got out there, and people were buying The King In Yellow, I wanted to tell them, “Don’t buy that! Go buy Galveston!” [Laughs] I realized that people need to have their own journey with the show. Whatever they end up with – whatever theories they have or don’t have – that’s what it means to connect with an audience. One of the most exciting things to see from people who really like the show is that it has inspired such great creativity in them. There are websites of True Detective artwork out there now and it’s beautiful. And I don’t want to take that away from anybody. I know what it means to me. But I don’t want to take away anyone’s interpretation of the show. If they have an interpretation that means it lives inside them and they connected with the show.True Detective doted a lot on religion. What does that subject/theme mean to you?It’s one of the stories we tell ourselves. I lived in the rural south in a heavily religious family but the only thing I can  point to there is this real sensitivity between knowing and wishing. We live in a culture that has a real hard time distinguishing fiction from reality. Even when they’re told something is fiction. I have people in the same breath ask me “Is this show supernatural?” and then ask me “What are you saying about Louisiana?” As if I am making a documentary. It’s a work of fiction. And it reflects one of things that fascinates me about our species and our culture is what we do with stories. I mean, look at people did with this story! It was a nice lesson learned for me. The show is not anti-religion or anti-anything. The show is against not thinking.What’s the update on season two?I am still fleshing it out. The basic idea: Hard women, bad men, and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system. I was well on my way in the writing but there’s been a lot noise and work around the end of the first season that got in the way.Is it true that you’ve retained the literary rights to Cohle and Hart?I do. So maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out. Always a possibility.Twitter: @EWDocJensen	Entertainment
707	Editor’s note: Alyssa Rosenberg is PostOpinions’s new culture blogger. Her own blog will be launching in the coming days. This post discusses the season finale of “True Detective” in extensive detail.As the final episode of the first season of HBO’s hit anthology series “True Detective” approached this Sunday, the show’s obsessive audience puzzled over what might happen when former detectives Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) caught up to the serial killer they’d been chasing across Louisiana for almost two decades. Would Marty, the genial Louisiana native, turn out to be the killer, hiding his brilliant scheme by playing the dummy to his more philosophically inclined partner? Would Marty and Rust finally learn that the secret they’d repeatedly missed had been obvious all along to the women they routinely abuse and ignore? Or, in keeping with the show’s many references to the Carcosa mythos, a concept shared among horror and fantasy writers for more than a century, would monsters from another world appear on the shores of the Louisiana bayou?In an interview before the series finale, series creator Nic Pizzolatto suggested something even weightier than an interlocking literary game. Explaining the stakes that Rust and Marty were facing as they reached the end stage of their quest, Pizzolatto told BuzzFeed’s Kate Aurthur: “I think given the amorphous nature of the evil they’re pursuing, its historical roots in culture and government, they would have to be willing to die to fully pursue their absolute justice.”Sussing out the “historical roots in culture and government” of sex crimes and the biases that let them go unprosecuted is a fascinating goal for any show to set itself. And it would have been a particularly strong mission statement for “True Detective.” The show was shot in Louisiana, and in its early episodes it showed some real signs of interest in what happens to the working poor when they become disabled by accidents or exposed to the compounds produced in the region’s chemical refineries. And Pizzolatto has described this season of “True Detective” — any that follow would have different characters and a different case — as “a close, two-person point-of-view show.” That’s an interesting opportunity to explore how two white, middle-class men might have been hobbled by their perspectives into blaming poor men for rich men’s crimes and coverups. A confrontation between two such men, the forces they’re aligned against and their own views of the world would be a fraught and original encounter.But the finale of “True Detective” didn’t do any of that. Instead, we got a predictable crime story that even the show’s most ardent defenders are going to be hard-put to argue is a clever examination of the genre, or of political power in Louisiana. The real killer of Dora Lange (Amanda Rose Batz), the first victim Rust and Marty investigated, turns out to be Errol Childress (Glenn Fleshler), the son of former sheriff Ted Childress. That relationship might have been enough to protect Errol, but he had other connections. Ted Childress was the unacknowledged son of Sam Tuttle, a powerful Louisiana patriarch. As a result, the Childresses were related to Billy Lee Tuttle (Jay O. Sanders), Sam Tuttle’s son and a powerful minister who tried to interfere with Rust and Marty’s initial investigation into the serial killings in 1995. And Ted’s cousin was  Eddie Tuttle, who served first as Louisiana governor and then as senator.That’s a rich web of power and family to explore, but “True Detective” leaves most of its revelations for the last hour of the show, leaving little time to meditate on specific relationships or Louisiana politics. Sheriff Childress covered up for Errol during the 1995 case, altering a missing persons case file to say that the report was made “in error.” His deputy sheriff, Steve Geraci, admits this all to Rust and Marty in the final episode, excusing his lack of curiosity about the change by telling the two men, “There’s a chain of command. No reason to change it. I just follow what the big man says. It’s how this all works.”That’s awfully anemic writing on a theme that’s familiar to anyone with a bedtime late enough to let them stay up for “True Detective.” And Geraci’s speech gives us no particular insight into what it might mean to be the “big man” Childress apparently was in the specific time and place that was Louisiana in 1995. We certainly don’t get any insight into why Rust and Marty weren’t curious at the time that Billy Lee Tuttle wanted to gain control of their case by assigning it to a task force. Rust may end up castigating himself for not having identified Errol as the killer earlier. But he and Marty were, in their own ways, just as willing to look away from the Tuttles and Childress as Geraci, a man they threaten for his cowardice and blindness.Rust and Marty don’t show any more curiosity about a woman (the spectacular and underused Ann Dowd) they find with Errol, who appears to have some sort of intellectual disability — and neither does “True Detective.” As the police swam in to the Childress family estate, she sits, terrified, among the wreckage of Errol’s mad fantasies, utterly alone. Detective Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) later tells Marty that she was “at least a half sister” to Errol, substituting a lazy stereotype about Southern incest for any insight into how she, and Errol’s dead victims, could go so utterly missing, or have been so invisible in the first place.Marty and Rust may have unhealthy relationships with women. But “True Detective” doesn’t actually show any more interest in the vanished women than they did. The show took time to demonstrate that the stories Rust and Marty told other detectives were lies, and even to linger as Marty narrated his way through a public records database. But it couldn’t make space in its eight episodes to give these women’s lives more purpose than as catalysts for Rust and Marty’s redemptions. Dora Lange emerges only in stories her ex tells about her. Prostitutes, domestic workers and chemical plant employees offer links in an investigative chain and are never heard from again.Even Marty’s much put-upon ex-wife Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) and estranged daughters ultimately showed up in the hospital to provide Marty with a tangible reward for his follow-through. Given that “True Detective” has strongly implied from its earliest episodes that Marty’s older daughter Audrey (Madison Wolfe) might have been a victim of abuse, or at least a witness to it, this disinterest in her inner life or the truth of what happened to her is particularly off-putting. In the world of “True Detective,” a man can do pretty much anything short of turning a woman into a paraphilic love map or trapping her in a house of horrors, and still deserve tender ministrations. And even as “True Detective” reacts in disgust to men who treat women as disposable, it also acts the same way toward Audrey, and to anyone who might have lived to receive the justice Dora Lange was denied.After Errol’s been killed and the case has gone national, we see a credulous news anchor telling her audience that reporting “discredited rumors that the accused was, in any way, related to Louisiana Senator Edmund Tuttle.” The Tuttles don’t even have to be tainted by association with a crooked branch in their family tree, much less take responsibility for any complicity they might have had in Errol’s crimes. Rust is discouraged, because he and Marty both know from a horrifying videotape that Errol wasn’t the only person involved in the ritual abuse of young women–he was just the last surviving member of his horrifying little community. But Marty bucks him up by insisting that he and Rust did their share and shouldn’t fret over the justice that’s eluded them. “We ain’t never gonna get ’em all. That ain’t what kind of world it is,” Marty says. “But we got ours.”That, apparently, is supposed to be enough to satisfy us. “Once there was only dark,” Rust tells Marty as the two men look up at the stars. “If you ask me, the light’s winning.” But telling us that the powerful will get off, and that there’s nothing to learn about why it happens so why bother, is a view of politics even blacker and more tangled than the Lair of Crazy Errol built in an old French fort. The Rusts and Martys of that world end up recovering in the hospital with the luxury to reach those cynical conclusions. The Dora Langes of it end up dead.Read more:“True Detective” finale crashes HBO GOMeet the band behind the “True Detective” theme song	Entertainment

It wasn’t the first time they’ve seen Errol. Cohle spoke to him ever so briefly back in 1995 when he was mowing a school yard, but missed the clues he needed to connect him at the time because A) he was sitting down – Cohle couldn’t see his height – and B) his face was too dirty for the scars to be noticeable. The fact that Hart was leaning on his horn while Cohle spoke to the man in ’95 didn’t help him focus on the fact that the suspect was right under his nose, either.During the finale, the two detectives finally catch up with Errol after Hart connects the color of his “ears” in the sketch with the color of a house in a photograph from one of their files. After speaking to the woman who owned the house at the time, they dig into her tax records to find the business who did the paint job. They then make a few more connections and are led to the serial killer’s home.They head to Errol’s house and try to call the new detectives investigating the case but there’s no cell phone service. Hart goes to the main house to ask for the phone. He’s greeted by Errol’s woman who says they have no phone, so he breaks in. He still has no luck making a call.Cohle goes to the smaller house, where Errol’s just killed the family dog, and spots his man. A chase leads them deep into Errol’s massive compound, and Cohle gets directions thanks to a voice in his head. “Come die with me, little prince,” he hears. Cohle enters a final, tall room with a hole at the top letting light in. He starts seeing a vision in the form of a night sky. Errol suddenly comes out and stabs him with a serious blow to the stomach, but Cohle’s still got his physical strength about him and head-butts Errol several times. Hart comes in and shoots him. It doesn’t do the trick, and Errol replies with a hammer to Hart’s chest. Cohle, on the ground, then delivers a bullet to Errol’s head. Moments later, cops arrive at the scene.We flash forward to the hospital where Hart is being briefed by the ’12 detectives. Several pieces of evidence at the scene were linked to the various murders. Hart’s family comes in for a visit too which brings him to tears.Cohle is alive, miraculously. He realizes that the man he saw riding the lawnmower in ’95 was his man all along, and he wishes he nabbed more of the people who were at fault (like the Tuttles). Hart reminds him that they got their man, and that’s all that matters.With a few sweeping shots of locations we’d seen over the season, we jump to Hart – who’s healthy again – wheeling Cohle out of the hospital. The latter has something bothering him: When he was on death’s door, he could feel his father and his daughter with him. The people he loved were close to him. “All I had to do was let go” to see them again. And now? He can still feel his daughter’s love there. “Even more than before. Nothing but that love.” “Dark has a lot more territory,” Hart says when admiring the night sky at the end of the episode. Cohle disagrees. “Once there was only dark. You ask me, the light’s winning.” The two leave the hospital for hopefully greener pastures.True Detective’s eight episode season ended with a little bit of peace for both Hart and Cohle. The former was in good spirits as he wheeled his friend out of the hospital, while the latter was thinking on the bright side after feeling the love of his daughter and father beside him for the first time in a long, long while.We want to hear your thoughts on this topic!

So, is that all for Rust Cohle and Martin Hart? Star-gazing and pondering the eternal battle of light versus dark? Certainly, their story won’t continue on the acclaimed HBO series, as it came to a close last night (read our recap here), with the second season focusing on a whole new set of characters and a case that hints at a grander storyline (read those details here). But there is some hope for those expecting more about Rust and Marty.Chatting with EW, Pizzolatto confirmed he retains the literary rights to the characters, and teases that he may not be through with them just yet. “…maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out. Always a possibility,” he shared.Yes, Pizzolatto is a novelist, and broke out with the noir-ish “Galveston” (now being made into a film starring Matthias Schoenaerts), but it also seems like making “Rust & Marty: The Novel” isn’t at the top of his to-do pile. That said, the possibilities of new stories with the pair is potentially interesting, considering there are plenty of lost years in “True Detective” timeline to dive into. That said, there is something pleasing about the finality of this story and these characters across eight episodes.

711	"Photo still from True Detective © 2014 Home Box OfficeAs Rust Cohle warned us at the end of Episode 3 of True Detective, “This is a world where nothing is solved.” At the end of the first season, the show didn’t so much explain all the answers as gesture toward them, leaving us to fill in the blanks (or, perhaps, plot holes). Below, we take our best crack at answering the finale’s big questions.

What movie was Errol watching at the beginning of the finale? And what was with all the creepy accents?

Errol is watching North by Northwest. True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto explained his thinking behind this scene in an interview with Alan Sepinwall:How were the Tuttles involved?

It remains unclear whether the Tuttles were directly involved in Errol’s crimes or whether they just helped cover them up. Toward the end of the finale, a newscaster says that rumors of a suggested family tie between the senator and Errol Childress had been denied. But we know better: They’re closely related, and the reverend, at least, was in deep. It seems likely that his powerful cousin was a part of the conspiracy, too, if not a participant in the crimes.The reverend’s father and the senator’s uncle, Sam Tuttle, was Errol’s grandfather. He raped both Errol and Errol’s sister, and he was open enough about his sexual appetites that his housekeeper, at least—whom we met in Episode 7—was well aware of them. Reverend Tuttle knew more: He kept a videotape of Marie Fontenot’s rape (and perhaps her murder), which occurred in the place Errol called Carcosa, in his safe. What’s more, Reverend Tuttle helped cover up the sexual abuse that took place at one of his Wellspring schools, in part by dismissing a deacon and claiming that it was due to charges of embezzlement. Did he orchestrate the abuse as well? True Detective doesn’t say.

 How did Papania find Rust and Marty in order to save them?

Presumably Marty is eventually able to find a working phone in the house to call him, though the episode doesn’t show this happen.

 Why does Rust say, “L’chaim, fat ass”? Isn't that kind of a random thing for a nihilist Texan to say?
The short answer is the Rule of Cool. (If something’s awesome enough, you don’t need to explain it.) The slightly longer answer is that the quote seems to be a reference to Daredevil comics. Here’s the panel in which Marvel superhero uses the line as a kiss-off to his archrival.As people untangle tonight's True Detective, here's one source: a 2003 Daredevil with the ""L'chaim, fatass"" quip pic.twitter.com/hKh4garWC3Who was the Yellow King?

This guy:Photo courtesy HBO(Costume designer Jenny Eagan confirmed this in our interview.)

At Carcosa, how was Errol able to make his voice appear to be everywhere at once?

Since Pizzolatto has said that “there is nothing supernatural” about the crimes in True Detective, it seems safe to assume that this, like Cohle’s final swirling cosmic vision, is a hallucination. (Either that, or Errol’s “Carcosa” has really crazy acoustics.)
Is there really a fort like that in Louisiana?Yes. The Carcosa scenes were filmed on location at Fort Macomb, which was built in 1822.
Photo by Infrogmation courtesy Wikimedia CommonsWhy did Errol draw so much attention to Dora Lange—even lighting the fire that drew the police to her body?Pizzolatto offered his explanation in an interview with Entertainment Weekly:What does Errol mean when he says, “My ascension removes me the disc in the loop?”

Errol’s mythology perhaps can’t be reasonably explained—the simplest answer seems to be simply “he’s crazy”—but Pizzolatto offered his own explanation to Entertainment Weekly:Why is the finale called “Form and Void”?

It’s a reference to Genesis 1:2:This also ties back to Rust’s closing speech. Rust reminds Marty, “Once there was only dark. You ask me, the light’s winning.” It isn’t until the following verse that God says, “Let there be light.”

What was up with the flower motif?

It may have been just a coincidence. In our interview with True Detective costume designer Jenny Eagan, we asked her if there was any hidden meaning to all the flowers featured in the costumes. She told us, “No, not really.”
Do painters really get paint on their ears?We put this question to Alan of the All Los Angeles Painting Company:
What do we know about Season 2?

Not much. From that same Alan Sepinwall interview with Pizzolatto:Read more of Slate’s True Detective coverage.

712	"RATINGS ARE A FLAT CIRCLE NEWS... HBO's True Detective looked into the stars last night during its season finale (which I reviewed!) and what looked back was a ton of eyeballs: 3.5 million people tuned in for the first airing, a very good number for a first-season show on HBO. By comparison, just over 3 million tuned in for the Season 1 finale of Game of Thrones, which is now HBO's biggest series. And the 11 million gross average viewers for True Detective's first season makes it the most-watched freshman series for HBO since the 2001 premiere of Six Feet Under. It's unclear how many of those viewers are paid subscribers, though. HBO GO, HBO's on-demand streaming service, broke under the weight of people trying to watch True Detective's finale, and many of those are believed to have been sharing passwords. Thanks for ruining it for the rest of us, you leeches! [Variety]BUSINESS TIME... The ratings were considerably more down-to-earth for Fox's out-of-this-world Cosmos. The remake of Carl Sagan's scientific saga was broadcast across 10 networks, including Fox, FX, FXX, and National Geographic, but still only managed to bring in 8.5 million viewers. One Fox projection had the company expecting northward of 40 million viewers. Doing a little quick math in my head, I can say that is a massive disappointment. That's what you get for for airing educational programming, Fox! More bikinis and explosions, please! [THR]... ABC's new sorta-zombie drama Resurrection fared much better, notching the best-rated midseason drama debut on network television in two years. An impressive 13.3 million viewers tuned in on a busy Sunday evening, which was good for a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demo. But is the show any good? Glad you asked, because I reviewed it. [The Wrap]... Cartoon Network just ordered a bazillion shows, so let's get through 'em as fast as we can! Over the Garden Wall is an animated miniseries about two brothers trapped in a mysterious land. Clarence follows an optimistic boy who wants to do everything and will debut on April 14. We Bare Bears centers on a trio of bears who are trying to assimilate into human society. There's also a slew of licensed shows, including a new Tom and Jerry, an updated Scooby-Doo! series called Be Cool Scooby-Doo!, Bugs Bunny in Wabbit, the Lego-branded series Ninjago, and Sonic the Hedgehog in the computer-animated Sonic Boom. Rounding out the roster are Total Drama: Pahkitew Island, Numb Chucks, and BeyRaiderz. [Deadline Hollywood]... Adult Swim has given the okay to Black Jesus, a live-action comedy from The Boondocks' Aaron McGruder. The show follows Jesus in present-day Compton, California, and stars Grand Theft Auto V's Gerald ""Slink"" Johnson. [Adult Swim via press release]CASTING NEWS... Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas) will star in Battle Creek, CBS's upcoming detective pilot from Breaking Bad's Vince Gilligan. He'll play one half of a pair of buddy cops assigned to keep the town of Battle Creek, Michigan crime-free, despite a lack of help from government resources. Dean Winters (Oz) plays his buddy. [TV Line]... Gabourey Sidibe (American Horror Story: Coven) will recur on Fox's hip-hop drama Empire. The series stars Terrence Howard as the head of a record label who's about to take his empire to the next level. Sidibe will play his assistant.

At that rate, a season finale that was anything less than the finest 60 minutes of television would be doomed to succeed. Alas, the last of eight episodes from Nic Pizzolatto’s first anthology is a solid, but not quite shattering hour of television. Nevertheless, it is filled with the key elements that any True Detective viewer would hope for: strong acting, haunting music and art direction, sublime camerawork, unbearable suspense and a smattering of dark humour.Since its start, True Detective has done so much to thwart our expectations of what a crime series can be that the rather conventional ending is bound to disappoint just about everybody. But, even if the episode does not fulfill the lofty hopes of its fans, I cannot imagine any Killing-like rage directed at HBO for failing to tie up some loose ends. One must remember that these eight episodes have always been more about uncovering the truth behind Hart and Cohle, rather than the suspect of Dora Lange’s murder. As a conclusion to suit the show’s character-driven nature, it was deeply satisfying.The foreboding figure at the end of episode seven is Errol William Childress. He has burns in his back, scars on his face and a beer belly. He lives in a shackled home in the middle of the lurid Louisiana wasteland with his bedraggled aunt/lover (played by Ann Dowd) and his dead father. Glenn Fleshler, who plays Errol, is tense and terrific, able to show menace and vulnerability in a single glance during a scene when he peeps on some children at play during recess.The first anti-climax that True Detective reaches in this hour is the brisk amount of time it takes Hart and Cohle to realize his identity. In a colourful drawing shown of Childress last week, the “spaghetti monster” had green ears. Well, in one of the case files connected to the Dora Lange case, one of the homes that was investigated was freshly painted green. One quick interview and a couple of web searches later, our detectives have an address. It may have been more gratifying for the duo to figure out his identity through a more labyrinthine process, but at least give Pizzolatto credit for, somewhat unpredictably, making Hart the one who connects the dots together.However, as flat and formulaic as some of this procedural becomes, it all leads up to another tour de force sequence directed by the great Cary Joji Fukunaga that is almost as remarkable as that tracking shot from episode four. (Fans of the show should check out Fukunaga’s breathtaking debut feature, Sin Nombre, if they haven’t already.) Few sequences in small-screen memory have such a visceral atmosphere. We can almost feel the chill of the graveyard-like entrance, as barren, dry trees loom over the road. We can smell the foul stench that Marty breathes in as he moves deeper into Childress’s home.Next PageFrom the web"	Entertainment
717	"The next season will feature a new cast, new characters but similar themes While we still won’t divulge too much, “True Detective” creator Nic Pizzolato is willing to divulge a couple of things about where the show is headed – as it enters its second season.
Though the next batch of episodes will fix on new characters and likely feature a new cast (with Matthew McConaughey confirming at last week’s Academy Awards that he and Woody Harrelson aren’t involved in the next season), some of the more popular themes of the first season will make a reprise. Shortly after Sunday’s broadcast premiere of the season one finale- whatcha think, y’all? did you guess as much? did it leave you – excuse the pun – scarred? – Pizzolato told HitFix a few what’s and where’s relating to the next season of the HBO drama. “This is really early, but I’ll tell you [it’s about] hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.”And assumingly, there’ll be a case needing solving involving the hard lasses, evil blokes and occult history of the transportation system. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be another murder mystery, though; Pizzolta has stated before that the title ‘True Detective’ can lend itself to anything- I guess anything that’s puzzle has a piece that needs relocating and fixing back into place. One element of the first season that Pizzolta said will likely be brought back for the second season are some of those kookier, almost supernatural-hinting moments from the first season. It’s those “Twin Peaks”-like moments that audiences seemed to go for, he says.“[The reaction to season one] has informed exactly one thing. It’s that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don’t play the next one straight.”While HBO hasn’t officially announced a season, the fact that the “True Detective” finale ‘broke’ HBO GO this weekend – because of the amount of requests coming in from those wanting to stream it – suggests it’s definitely on their roster for 2015. One suspects they’re going to wait until they’ve got their ‘big names’ for the second season, before announcing the new season.(on a side note : Pizzolato has retained the rights to Harrelson and McConaughey’s Hart and Cohle characters, so there is a chance – even if it’s in the form of a novel, or something – we might see them again one day).

719	"In some ways, True Detective is a great love story. Much like Stringer Bell and Avon Barksdale on The Wire, Rust (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty (Woody Harrelson) find in each other an adversary, a counterpoint, and a literal, and figurative, partner in crime. ""You're obsessive,"" Marty informs Rust. ""You're obsessive, too,"" Rust retorts, ""just not about the job."" Marty's obsession, of course, is women other than the mother of his children, Maggie (Michelle Monaghan). At the beginning of True Detective, we are introduced to Marty's first mistress, Lisa (Alexis Daddario), a court reporter who, as Rust later observes, pretty much looks like a younger, bustier version of Mrs. Hart.As critics have argued all over the 'net, True Detective is either infuriatingly, brutishly misogynistic (The New Yorker) or purposefully misogynistic, and therefore, thoughtfully dismissive of its female characters (Slate). Regardless of intention, creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cary Fukunaga have made a blanket statement regarding their purview on female sexuality. And it's pretty judgmental. A woman seeking sex is playing with fire. Over the course of the show's blistering eight episodes, we see a a variety of sexual situations, but none that resemble a realistically intimate moment. On True Detective, a woman who succumbs to sexual advances (or seeks physical satisfaction) is asking for humiliation, dismissal, or emotional ruin. If she wasn't asking for it, the show seems to suggest, she shouldn't have worn such a short skirt.Related: 'Nymphomaniac' Makes Me Proud to Be a WomanPhoto: HBO/Lacey TerrellWhether we're privy to a spectacularly nubile young woman throwing herself at the paunchy, married Marty or a mentally disturbed woman begging her own deranged half-brother to ""make flowers"" on her, the women of True Detective have a uniformly peculiar relationship with the opposite sex. Even Maggie—who, based on her interactions with Detectives Gilbough and Papania has enough agency to withhold information, use deductive reasoning, and even drop the occasional feminist pronouncement regarding the uniform idiocy of men—falls victim to a familiar male gaze sex trope. After she's all but gotten a confession out of her philandering husband, Marty begins to whimper about being ""all fucked up."" Sure, he's cheated on her, several times and with sociopathic abandon, but he's also seen things on the job that he simply can't forget. Fucked up things. He's having a hard time reconciling his professional life and his work life. He's just, hell, he's just having a really hard time, Maggie! She can see the hurt in his eyes, and the evidence of too many long nights on the underarms of his threadbare wife beater, and feels compelled to soothe his pain with a flurry of passionate kisses. What about this scenario screams sympathy sex? Am I missing something?Photo: HBO/Lacey TerrellThen, there's Maggie's tryst with Rust. After making eyes at each other all season, Rust, who seems to appreciate and value Maggie's intelligence and sophistication, violently takes her from behind in perhaps the heartbreakingest seven seconds of TV sex. It was an especially gutting moment because, despite his erratic behavior and willingness to cover up for Marty's indiscretions, we think Rust is a good guy. We see him turn down advancements from drug-addled prostitutes; he drinks to drown out the memory of his slain daughter; and when he engages Maggie in conversation, it feels like her adores her. Until he degrades her. And then accuses her of Black Widow-ing her way between him and his partner. She's scarcely pulled up her underwear before she is cast out of his apartment like a leper. ""Get the fuck out of here!"" he bellows, any hint of tenderness and longing drained from his red-rimmed eyes. Et tu, Rust?Related: Why Changing Your Hair Makes You a Sundance Cliché""I like something wild. I always did,"" Marty tells Rust of his penchant for ""crazy"" women. ""Feels like it smoothes out the other parts of my life."" I'm sorry, but we're supposed to believe that an over-the-hill cop is a magnet for insanely gorgeous but totally unstable women? That, in the back country of Louisianna, there exists an enclave of job-holding psychowhores, who simply cannot resist Marty's butter blonde mop and Jameson breath? ""You're a good man,"" Lisa, a former teen prostitute who now works at a local T-mobile store, impresses upon Marty. He and his badge had, after all, come to her bunny ranch looking for a missing girl. Between swigs from a pony neck beer, he tries on a look of chagrined humility for size. Bingo. She becomes obsessed and sooon starts sending scantily-clad selfies and begging her married lover to ""put it in her ass."" Again, Where do these women get this stuff?Photo: HBO/Lacey TerrellThe icing on the cake is Marty's own teenage daughter, Audrey (Erin Moriarty) who gets busted trying to attempt a threesome with two of the ugliest, strung out dudes south of the Mason-Dixon. Upon discovering what she's done, Marty slaps her and calls her a ""whore."" Whether the irony that his daughter is precisely the kind of woman he's been sleeping with is lost on him or suddenly glaringly obvious, all I could think was, She wanted to have a threesome with those guys? For real? In what world are these women falling victim to these men? What kind of dog-eared, graphic novel served as Pizzolatto and Fukunaga's sex ed primer? Despite their varying lots in life—incest-friendly love interest of a child murderer, suburban housewife, reformed sex worker, attention seeking high schooler—there's really only one type of woman on True Detective: the blow-up doll.Photos: Ann Dowd: Jim Spellman/WireImage; Lili Simmons: C Flanigan/FilmMagic; Erin Moriarty: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic"	Entertainment
720	"by Tierney MonaghanGoing into the season finale, True Detective had a lot of expectations swirling around. Theories about the Yellow King abounded on the Internet. Parody videos proliferated. Writer Nic Pizzolatto was interviewed about whether he’d learned anything from the first season of The Killing, a show he worked on previously. People were nervous that True Detective might end in the same way that show had, by not coming to any conclusions at all. When the show arrived, an estimated 11 million people wanted to see how this would end. As many people tried to stream the show on HBO Go, the servers crashed and the wait for the finale continued for several hours. “Form and Void” picks up right where “After You’ve Gone” left off last week. The episode opens at the Childress compound, where Errol Childress, the scarred man, is telling a man who is chained to a bed frame that if he behaves, he can have some more water around noon. Errol picks up a slop bucket, and leaves the small cottage, walking back to the main house, which is basically rotting away. In the house is a mentally challenged woman who is both cowed and cuddled by Errol. He asks her to tell him a story again, which turns out to be a description of her molestation by her grandfather. Meanwhile, Hart and Cohle are still on the fishing boat with Sheriff Gerasi, trying to get the real story of what happened in the Marie Fontenot case. Cohle forces Gerasi to watch the video of Fontenot’s torture, and he spills the story from there. Gerasi took the original missing persons report on Fontenot. Later, he went back and the report was marked “made in error.” Sheriff Childress had done this, claiming he’d spoken to the family and that the girl had been sent to live with her father. Gerasi says that he had nothing else to do with the case, that he was following chain of command. Within a year, he was working for the state CID based on Sheriff Childress’ recommendation. Having received all the information they can from Gerasi, Hart and Cohle dock the fishing boat they stole, threaten Gerasi with a sniper if he says anything and head out to continue their investigation. They are still searching for the identity of the scarred man. The definitive clue comes from a picture taken during the canvassing during the Lange case. An elderly woman’s recollection of getting her house painted leads Hart and Cohle through the tax records and leads them to the address of Childress & Sons maintenance.  Ever the pessimist, Cohle leaves his boss copies of their investigation notes and the video of Marie Fontenot’s torture to be mailed to the authorities and the media. Should he and Hart disappear for more than a day, his boss is to mail the packages, which will hopefully lead the authorities to the Childress compound. Then Hart and Cohle take off to see what is afoot at the address they’ve found. This brings us back around to the creepy, overgrown, dilapidated house from the beginning of the episode. The car is barely parked in front of the house when Cohle takes off toward the cottage and fields beyond. Hart knocks on the door, posing as a surveyor who is lost and needs to use the phone. The woman answers the door, and says they don’t have a phone. After Cohle yells for him, Hart pushes his way into the house, checking to make sure Errol isn’t hiding in there. “He’s going to come for you. He’s worse than anyone,” the woman warns him. Around this same time, Cohle spots Errol out in the field and takes chase after him.  The chase leads into some sort of catacomb/tunnel system. It’s packed with the wicker sculptures that have peppered the crime scenes throughout the episodes. Cohle winds ever deeper through the vine choked passages in pursuit of Errol. As Errol taunts him from the distance, he speeds up, not checking corners as carefully. Entering a large chamber with an opening to the sky, Errol steps from the shadows and skewers Cohle with a large knife. He is lifted of his feet by the force of the thrust, and then dropped on the ground when Hart catches up with them. Hart catches an axe in the chest for his troubles. As Errol leans over him, Cohle manages to sit up and move around enough to shoot Errol in the head. It is an undetermined amount of time later when the authorities arrive and shoot a flare into the sky, which Hart and Cohle see through the hole in the ceiling of the chamber.  Both of the former detectives end up at Lafayette General Hospital. Marty’s daughters and Maggie come to visit him, and he falls apart as he tries to convince them he’s going to be okay. Cohle ends up in a coma after his surgery, but eventually awakes and hears more about the progress of the case on the news. Hart continually visits him, even making arrangements for where he’ll go once he leaves the hospital. One night, Hart wheels his partner outside for a cigarette and the conversation turns to the case and how Cohle sees the whole experience. After he struggles to describe his near death experience, Cohle says that in the end, there is “just one story, the oldest. Light versus dark.” It’s a succinct summation of this season of True Detective. It has been an intriguing, occasionally frustrating meditation on light versus dark. I’m left with the sense that even though the light won this round, it was a very near thing. Perhaps what this show has done best is to explore the vast gray areas of personal and societal morality. When even the “good guys” struggle to keep the darkness at the edges of their lives, what hope is there for all of us as a whole? Thank you, Rust Cohle. Now I sound as conflicted and pessimistic as you.

			Trending:		Ted (Josh Radnor) asks The Mother (Cristin Milioti) to marry him on ""How I Met Your Mother.""Matthew McConaughey, left, and Woody Harrelson in ""True Detective.""I hate when a good series ends, not just because I will miss the show, but because I so rarely like the endings.“True Detective” became the latest series to complain about, as HBO’s wonderfully tilted mystery series came with a finale that seemed to have little to do with the show we had been watching for the previous seven episodes.(Spoiler alert: If you are not up to date on “True Detective,” skip to the next item.)“True Detective” had been the best new series of the year so far, a bizarre and engrossing tale that took the framework of a highly conventional police drama and overlaid it with flowery speech and philosophical ideas, most of them coming from Matthew McConaughey’s character, Rust Cohle, a person so badly damaged psychologically as to be almost non-functional.The storytelling used parallel time tracks and unreliable narration to give the story extra layers of mystery. It was baffling and sometimes hard to follow, but it was always intriguing.But it came in the guise of a police-buddy drama we had seen 1,000 times before. Cohle’s partner, Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), was a hard-working, philandering, family-ignoring homicide detective. Cohle and Hart were the mavericks, bucking the chain of command for ultimately noble causes. They tracked down a serial killer and – of course – found the trail leading through “respectable” society.We assumed, all along, that at some point the archetype would be shattered in a new and clever way. Instead, we found Sunday that it was our assumptions that would be shattered, and convention would triumph because the show didn’t really know how it wanted to end.Bad guy Errol Childress – there was no last twist – seemed almost laughably absurd and certainly not the sort of villain one expected at the end of the twisted road we had traveled. Worse, the post-climax sequence brought a happy ending and a rescued Rust, a transformation that seemed to come out of the blue.The story of Cohle and Hart is over and McConaughey and Harrelson have moved on to other projects, but HBO may bring “True Detective” back next year, with a different cast and story altogether. Let’s hope creator Nic Pizzolatto thinks that one all the way through to the end.YOUR ‘MOTHER’ SHOULD KNOWThe ending of another series, “How I Met Your Mother,” has been stirring up the fans before it even has happened.The March 3 episode appeared to confirm a long-held but faintly embraced hypothesis about the Mother of the title: She’s dead.The conceit of this mild-mannered sitcom is that the show takes place in 2030, and Josh Radnor’s character, Ted, is recalling the events of today for his children, explaining to them the torturously long process of how he met their mother. Some fans have speculated that the reason Ted is telling the story is because the mother recently died or is dying.Like most such theories, it is internally consistent but doesn’t make a lot of sense in context. Why would such a light-hearted comedy spend nine years getting to the point of introducing Ted to the mother – whose name we still don’t know – just to reveal that she’s dead? In the all-time ranking of bad sitcom ideas, that would go near the top, somewhere between “My Mother the Car” and letting Joanie and Chachi have their own show.Cristin Milioti, who plays the mother, poured a big pitcher of ice water on the notion, bluntly telling the Hollywood Reporter, “That’s crazy.”Any show that has been telegraphing a surprise ending for nine seasons is bound to generate some theories about its finish. We’ve also heard that Ted is the one who is dead/dying, that there will be some switcheroo with the identity of the mother (it’s really Robin!) or that there is some other major twist regarding the veracity of Ted’s storytelling.Most likely, though, is that Ted’s longing has to do with being separated from the Mother somehow, and she will return to him in the next-to-last scene, right before they meet for the first time on that train platform, in the rain.Contact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on TwitterGet the latest news delivered daily!We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

725	"The demand for tonight’s season finale of HBO‘s True Detective was so great online, the network’s streaming service HBO GO temporarily crashed trying to fulfill all incoming requests for the closing episode. “Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we’ve been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon,” HBO GO tweeted earlier tonight. Service was eventually restored. The disruption reaffirms True Detective‘s status as a pop culture phenomenon, which it has been able to achieve in only eight episodes. It also underlines how inherently irrelevant traditional overnight ratings are with that so many HBO subscribers preferring to watch online, they overwhelmed the network’s server. Of course, the streaming difficulties could have prompted True Detective fans who had no intention of watching the show on TV to do so, bringing extra viewers for the finale’s Nielsen ratings. While the first season of True Detective was conceived as a closed-ended arc with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, creator Nic Pizzolatto is already working on a premise for a second season with new characters and a new storyline in a new locale.

“True Detective” has finished, and now the debate begins on its legacy. Did it live up to the promise in the first half of the season? Was the story concluded in a satisfactory manner? Is this really one of the greatest shows in TV history? We’ll let you hash it out in the comments section, but in this writer’s opinion, there hasn’t been a TV drama this dense, rich and satisfying in a long, long time. That said, last night’s finale did leave a slightly sour taste in the mouths of some. Obviously, **SPOILERS AHEAD**.So, in “Form And Void,” we saw both Rust and Martin near death, only to survive and spend the last quarter of the show involved in a discussion of light versus dark, and the meaning of the universe. As we wrote in our recap, it was a fitting and rather poetic conclusion, with both men changed from what they’ve experienced. But it wasn’t the supernatural finale some were hoping for or tragic conclusion some expected. And writer/creator Nic Pizzolatto shares his approach and some of the other ideas he had going into the finale.






“For me as a storyteller, I want to follow the characters and the story through what they organically demand. And it would have been the easiest thing in the world to kill one or both of these guys,” Pizzolatto told HitFix. “I even had an idea where something more mysterious happened to them, where they vanished into the unknown and Gilbough and Papania had to clean up the mess and nobody knows what happens to them. Or it could have gone full blown supernatural. But I think both of those things would have been easy, and they would have denied the sort of realist questions the show had been asking all along. To retreat to the supernatural, or to take the easy dramatic route of killing a character in order to achieve an emotional response from the audience, I thought would have been a disservice to the story. What was more interesting to me is that both these men are left in a place of deliverance, a place where even Cohle might be able to acknowledge the possibility of grace in the world.”And it was a smart choice, giving the finale of “True Detective” a true emotional heft (Rust’s story about feeling his daughter’s presence and love while on the brink of death is awards reel stuff). But perhaps vexing to many was that the conspiracy around the Tuttle churches stayed in the background and was not fully resolved. Martin even quiets Gilbough and Papania when they start explaining where the investigation has gone. But for Pizzolatto, it was all about making the show as real as possible. “The conspiracies that I’ve researched and encountered, they seem to happen very ad hoc: they become conspiracies when it’s necessary to have a conspiracy. I think it would have rang false to have Hart and Cohle suddenly clean up 50 years of the culture history that led to Errol Childress, or to get all the men in that video,” he explained. “It’s important to me, I think, that Cohle says, ‘We didn’t get em all, Marty,’ and Marty says, ‘We ain’t going to. This isn’t that kind of world.’ This isn’t the kind of world where you mop up everything. We discharged our duty, but of course there are levels and wheels and historical contexts to what happened that we’ll never be able to touch.”






It’s a brave position to take, and a choice that leaves the world of “True Detective” as complex and unfair and haunted as it was when we entered. But now, the big question: what’s happening with season two? Well, Pizzolatto is already putting pen to paper, for another conspiratorial tale, but one that seems to be more national in scope.“Okay. This is really early, but I’ll tell you (it’s about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system,” the writer shared.

Across the night’s three telecasts, the series also hit a high with 4.9 million viewers.According to HBO, with an average gross audience of 11 million viewers, “True Detective” is the network’s most popular first-year series since “Six Feet Under,” which was drawing about 11.4 million viewers per episode in its 2001 premiere season.Sunday’s tally is impressive considering the tough live drama competition “True Detective” faced at 9 p.m. from AMC’s “The Walking Dead” and ABC’s “Resurrection,” which opened very well.






“True Detective” bowed on Jan. 12 with 2.3 million viewers for its 9 p.m. telecast, making it the premium cabler’s most-watched debut since “Boardwalk Empire” drew 4.8 million in 2010. Among the shows that “True Detective” outperformed in its premiere are dramas “Game of Thrones” (2.22 million) and “The Newsroom” (2.14 million) and comedies “Veep” (1.38 million) and “Girls” (870,000).HBO has already renewed “True Detective” for a second season.HBO’s “True Detective” is shaping up to be the network’s most-watched rookie series since “Six Feet Under” as the first-season finale of the anthology series averaged a series-best 3.5 million viewers for its initial telecast. “Detective” added more than 1 million viewers from last week, when it went up against the Oscars and drew 2.33 […]HBO’s “True Detective” is shaping up to be the network’s most-watched rookie series since “Six Feet Under” as the first-season finale of the anthology series averaged a series-best 3.5 million viewers for its initial telecast. “Detective” added more than 1 million viewers from last week, when it went up against the Oscars and drew 2.33 […]HBO’s “True Detective” is shaping up to be the network’s most-watched rookie series since “Six Feet Under” as the first-season finale of the anthology series averaged a series-best 3.5 million viewers for its initial telecast. “Detective” added more than 1 million viewers from last week, when it went up against the Oscars and drew 2.33 […]HBO’s “True Detective” is shaping up to be the network’s most-watched rookie series since “Six Feet Under” as the first-season finale of the anthology series averaged a series-best 3.5 million viewers for its initial telecast. “Detective” added more than 1 million viewers from last week, when it went up against the Oscars and drew 2.33 […]HBO’s “True Detective” is shaping up to be the network’s most-watched rookie series since “Six Feet Under” as the first-season finale of the anthology series averaged a series-best 3.5 million viewers for its initial telecast. “Detective” added more than 1 million viewers from last week, when it went up against the Oscars and drew 2.33 […]HBO’s “True Detective” is shaping up to be the network’s most-watched rookie series since “Six Feet Under” as the first-season finale of the anthology series averaged a series-best 3.5 million viewers for its initial telecast. “Detective” added more than 1 million viewers from last week, when it went up against the Oscars and drew 2.33 […]HBO’s “True Detective” is shaping up to be the network’s most-watched rookie series since “Six Feet Under” as the first-season finale of the anthology series averaged a series-best 3.5 million viewers for its initial telecast. “Detective” added more than 1 million viewers from last week, when it went up against the Oscars and drew 2.33 […]© Copyright 2017 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC.

728	"Sign up for our newsletterConnect with usTrue Detective ended last night but I’m not shutting up about it just yet. There will be a True Detective season 2 and I’m already jonesing for it. I keep looking over old trailers and teasers and getting ready to compare the unfinished versions I got against the ones I can watch on HBO Go.The true detectives got their perp. They didn’t get everyone, but they repaid their debt. That was some sick sick shit they were dealing with and now that it’s over, what’s next and how are they going to top what they’ve given us already? True Detective’s creator Nic Pizzolatto has been throwing down hints. And one is that he’s got to keep pumping out the weird. He’s good with weird. He says “my wife read a comment the other day that said I live out in the desert, and I run some kind of cult. He says all the talk on the net ""informed exactly one thing. It's that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don't play the next one straight.""He’s right. It was the supernatural suspense that kept me coming back hungry for a little of Carcosa’s time. Pizzolatto says “I'm interested in the atmosphere of cosmic horror, but that's about all I have to say about weird fiction. I did feel the perception was tilted more towards weird fiction than perhaps it should have been. “
 

True Detective's lead actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey aren’t coming back. Their commitment and easy rapport is going to be hard to replace. Pizzolato says his stories are usually heavy on the female characters and that next season is going to be about “hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.” The transportation system has an occult history? Did they put the Mass in Mass Transit?I can see Pizzolatto pouring over old train manuals, finding the symbolic significance of the third rail. The way he referenced Robert W. Chambers’ King in Yellow and works by H.P. Lovecraft and the M-Theory. Or did we all read too much into that ? Pizzolatto says, “look, it's all good … my only interest in the Chambers stuff  is as a story that has a place in American myth. And it's a story about a story that drives people into madness. … I wouldn't tell anyone to go buy Robert Chambers. It's not that great a book. Joseph Conrad and William Faulkner I think are in there far more than Chambers or Lovecraft.”Pizzolato talked about the strange in the past season. That James Mason voice that Errol Childress slips into after seeing Cary Grant on TV in North by Northwest showed us that “he learned how to enunciate properly through watching all these old VCR movies. And that brings us back to the idea of storytelling, right? At one minute he can affect this Andy Griffith good ol' boy voice, the next he can sound like James Mason, and when he wants to use his real voice, he sounds like something wounded and damaged. And then when Cohle is in Carcosa, he sounds like something entirely different.”True Detective returns to HBO next year. I’m watching. In my head I’m watching already.SOURCE: HitFixLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for all news updates related to the world of geek.

729	ByonHBO cracked the superb ratings code with True Detective, the immensely popular anthology whose season finale on Sunday night blew out the ratings and the HBO Go website in under an hour.As the True Detective finale got underway last night, scores of viewers on pins and needles flooded the HBO Go website from their computers, iPads, phones and a variety of non-TV devices to live stream the final episode and learn the identity of the Yellow King. So many people tried to watch the True Detective finale live streaming at HBO Go that the website crashed for a period of time.Setting aside a large number of HBO subscribers that chose to online stream the finale, a total of 3.5 million viewers settled onto their couch to watch it on the HBO channel per Nielsen. That’s the highest rated episode of the eight-episode run, easily besting the 2.3 million viewers who tuned in for the premiere.A total of 11 million unique viewers watched True Detective over the course of its first season. That’s the most viewers to tune into a debut season of an HBO series since the Six Feet Under freshman season way back in 2001.With as big a hit as True Detective has become, it’s no surprise that HBO is pushing creator Nic Pizzolatto to get busy on a second season. Pizzolatto and HBO have already confirmed that Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson will not return, and that the next anthology will be all new characters and a new story, ala American Horror Story.Information is scarce about where the second season might head, but Pizzolatto did share the following with HitFix in an interview. “This is really early, but I’ll tell you it’s about hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.”In case you missed True Detective last night, HBO Go is fully functional today and the season finale is waiting for you.‘Permission’ Review: An Indecent Proposal‘The 15:17 To Paris’ Review: A Big But…‘Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle’ 4K, Blu-ray, Digital and DVD Release Dates and Details‘Suburbicon’ Blu-ray Combo Prize Pack GiveawayWeekend Box Office: Hollywood Fumbles on Super Bowl Weekend‘Deep Blue Sea 2’ to Terrorize Blu-ray, DVD and Digital in April; Watch Trailer Now‘Downsizing’ 4K, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Release Date and Details‘Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri’ Coming to 4K, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital This Month‘Permission’ Review: An Indecent Proposal‘The 15:17 To Paris’ Review: A Big But…‘The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter’ Review: Despair Has Never Looked So Good‘Of Mice And Sand – Revised’ Review: The Best Laid Plans’12 Strong’ Review: …And The Horses They Rode In OnCopyright © 2007-2016 TheHDRoom, Zboos LLC	Entertainment
730	MyBroadband – Trusted in TechHBO says its streaming service is running again, although disappointingly late for many anxious fans of the “True Detective” series.Most fans who tried to log onto the “HBO GO” stream for the Sunday-night season finale of “True Detective” weren’t able to do so because the service crashed. HBO said Monday the service interruption was due to “an excessive amount of traffic” soon after the 9 p.m. Eastern start of the episode. Many viewers saw a spinning circle indicating the show was loading, but it didn’t.HBO had similar issues with its service last year surrounding episodes of “Game of Thrones.”Company spokesman Jeff Cusson (KEW-sahn) said Monday the service is now working.Netflix, Hulu streaming illegal in SAThis is what South Africa’s Internet actually looks likeThe World Wide Web: a timelineHBO HBO GO internet streaming quicknewsComments section policy: Any attacks on MyBroadband, its journalists, or other readers will result in a ban.Would you rather own a car or use Uber all the time?View Results	Entertainment

You know how old timey interviewers love asking celebrities, ""Who would you invite to your dream dinner party? And why?""I've thought about this from time to time. And while there are no wrong answers to these things, the RIGHT answer is clearly, ""No one too awesome"" because otherwise you'd be too goddamn nervous to eat.This is why, I suspect, Rust Cohle would actually make a good dinner party guest (his total stuff up at Marty's place notwithstanding). With someone like him in the mix, other guests would suddenly appear a lot more fun, cheery and audible by contrast.What's more, you can trust him to provide strange yet fascinating conversation nuggets that you can then marvel at and gossip over on the way home.If, like us, you're mourning the end of True Detective and Cohe's awesome quotes, the good news is Buzzfeed has put together a series of greeting cards that have imortalised his strangeness for all ocassions.Now not only can you picture throwing a dinner party with Cohle, you can imagine sending these out to your fake guests too. HBO / Via bustle.comHBO / Via insidetv.ew.com   Source: Buzzfeed Get our best stories delivered to your inbox each day!A viral video sparks a discussion on why women resort to ... Aziz Ansari inspired me to ask my parents about their ... As writer Bim Adewunmi points out, race is not a Very ... It's callous to expect people to work their entire lives, ... Do you really want to be the sort of parent who prioritises ... The best-ever politician throwbacksAdorable celeb friendship throwbacksCelebs not giving a damn on the red carpetWomen who challenged their employers, and wonWomen lost to family violence in 201621 striking displays of feminist art activism "	Entertainment

735	"One of the things that made HBO’s True Detective special is the way that it was made. Writer Nic Pizzolatto defied the conventions of television writing (where most scripts are written by committee in a writer’s room) and instead holed himself up alone in a hotel and churned out all eight episodes.The result was a wholly personal, truly singular vision overlaid on the most conventional of story structures: two cops hunting for a murderer. In Pizzolatto’s hands, the fractured timeline slows to a crawl and suddenly hurtles forward, and through soliloquies and raised eyebrows reveals the damaged souls of two detectives who tend to say one thing and do just the opposite.It’s compelling stuff, and coupled with the masterful performances of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, it's a brand of storytelling that literally shut down HBO GO on Sunday, as viewers clamored to get  first –or second—look at the season finale.Those first six or so episodes programmed us to expect almost anything from the True Detective finale. Except perhaps what we got.  Pizzolatto provided the most surprising thing of all—a straight ending. “Form and Void” featured no time shifting, no supernatural tangents, and relatively little in the way of metaphysical asides. (And no Yellow King.) But for the big stars and dazzling camera work,  the last hour of True Detective would fit inside an episode of Law and Order. Most of it, anyway.
In the first 45 minutes or so, Hart and Cohle blitz through the procedures of this procedural as if they had a to-do list. Marty shakes the detective’s curse, finally asking the right question: Why is the Green Monster green? From there they work the case step by step, bouncing from Steve Geraci’s Maserati to an old woman’s tax returns, until they end up rushing in real time from Hart’s strip mall office to the Heart of Darkness.Our monster? He’s holed up in a house that’s straight out a very special episode of Hoarders, sporting an over-the-top British accent that channels James Mason. “Top notch constitutional!” Errol enunciates. And he calls his German Shepherd “old chap” even as he hurls a frying pan at him.And then it’s the obligatory fight to the death. The scene nods toward Hart and Cohle's previous showdown with Reggie LeDoux. But as it dragged on, it reminded me of the last 15 minutes of The Silence of the Lambs after Anthony Hopkins has taken his fava beans and his nice chianti and split. It’s well crafted but we’ve been down this road before.Ultimately, our heroes do what TV cops do: they catch the bad guy, and they save each other (although it was close for a minute there for ol’ Rust, wudn’t it?) It’s almost like something out of that true crime book that Marty might write.Pizzolatto’s message is pretty straightforward: None of this really matters. Running through the woods with a gun is the least interesting thing that these cops do. I buy the premise, but I'd also argue that it could have been executed better.True Detective’s strengths have been characterization and dialogue. Pizzolatto is great at telling stories, and, with the exception of Cary Fukunaga’s brilliant, breathless single-shot staging of the raid in episode four, the show’s best moments have come when he sticks to that MO.I think the finale is one place where True Detective might have been better served if Pizzolatto had some help. If these scenes were batted around in a writer’s room—with a couple of the guys from, say, Justified—I believe that the other writers would would have found a way to add style and surprise to scenes that felt like housekeeping. Or they would have encouraged Pizzolatto to make the courageous choice to drastically shorten or even eliminate the procedural parts of the plot altogether.But whatever the flaws of the finale’s main plot arc, True Detective found its footing in the last few minutes. The internet notwithstanding, this has never been a story about Dora Lange or the Yellow King. It’s about these two guys who need each other but can’t say it. For all their physical courage, they lack the courage to, well, embrace life. L'chaim indeed, Rust Cohle.Bringing Errol to justice and closing this case? That’s really beside the point. These last two episodes were about healing the old wounds between old friends.Rust Cohle may believe that it took a near-death- experience, in which he saw his departed daughter and his deceased dad, for him to change his view of the world. But it's clear to Pizzolatto--and us-- that seeing Marty again was every bit as important in Rust's transformation.In the unlikely setting of a hospital parking lot, Marty and Rust both look heavenward and swap places, ontologically speaking.""It's just one story: the oldest, light versus dark,"" says Cohle, vulnerable in a way we've never seen before.“I know we ain't in Alaska ”says Marty, with newfound grit. ""But it appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory.""“You’re looking at it wrong, Once there was only dark,"" Cohle replies. "" If you ask me, the light’s winning.”And a finely wrought as that dialogue is, it's Marty's little laugh as he helps his friend to the car that sums up the arc of this story.

737	"A few final stray thoughts on the 'True Detective' finale before we all go back to obsessing over more frivolous things:One of the main complains about the last epsiode was that Rust Cohle's newfound optimism in the final reels felt unearned. Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) had for so long been such an extreme pessimist and cynic that his final movement toward a more optimistic worldview didn't compute—or so the argument goes. I think this is miguided for several reasons.Solving a case that has been bothering you for a good chunk of 17 years—and coming close to death while doing so—just might lead you to, I don't know, have a change of heart. But others don't see it that way. The terrific Emily Nussbaum, for example, snarkily writes that Marty was ""'fine, just fine,' recovered from years of Match Personals and TV dinners. Rust had a touching dream about his dead daughter, in which he glimpsed light beneath the darkness."" After what they have been through, is this really so odd? Would the experience really not elicit existential feelings in nearly everyone?Similarly, while I probably have less religious feeling than 99% of the people in this country, for Willa Paskin to write, ""I think maybe True Detective ended with Rust Cohle finding God? Talk me off the ledge,"" and add that it all seemed ""cheesy and mystical"" seemed a tad unfair. The show did go some way to explaining why people depart from materialist views of the world, however objectively incorrect those views might be.But my central complaint against this argument is that it sidelines what was so touching and powerful about the ending; namely, that McConaughey was making a gesture towards his partner. In scene after scene over eight episodes, Marty mocked Rust's nihilism and showed impatience with his anti-religious rants. One, in particular, took place at a rural church, where McConaughey heaped scorn on the believers. I thus saw the final scene as McConaughey trying to establish a closer connection with Harrelson, and taking a step towards the latter's less cynical view of the world. None of this means that either man is going to become an optimist or a believer (or that, per Nussbaum, we are supposed to believe that Marty's ""fine"" line means all is in fact swell). Moreover, it's not as if McConaughey is in the process of becoming a full-blown fundamentalist. It is thus odd for Spencer Korbhaber, on The Atlantic's excellent roundtable, to write that ""Rust scoffed at tent worshippers, and the Carcosa cult’s belief in the supernatural had terrible consequences, but Rust ends up joining all of them by buying into comforting, irrational mumbo jumbo."" So saying you are slightly optimistic about the course of humanity is the same as being a fundamentalist Christian at a (presumably very strict) church, or joining a cult that kills children?To return to Nussbaum's complaint about the tidy wrap-up of Hart's personal journey, I also think many of the critics have been much too hard on the brief, awkward scene in which Hart's estranged family comes to see him in the hospital. It's true that this was another instance of peripheral, female characters given very little to do; but it was also sad and moving because it displayed the ways in which, even in his heroic moment, Harrelson's prior behavior left him wounded and alone.For those who found the wrap-up too tidy and light (as opposed to dark, to use Rust's formulation), it is worth remembering that the show had one other ""light"" wrap-up three episodes earlier, in which the supposed killers were caught, the cops were heroes, and all seemed briefly well with the world. And how long did that last? It is certainly relevant that the creative team behind the show chose to end it on the note that they did, but I don't think we are meant to read too much into these final nice moments. This is still a dark show with two characters who are not going to be permanently cured of their difficulties. Still, the more I read about the actual plot makes me think that the critics do have a point about the laziness of the wrap-up. The clue that led to the men cracking the case open was pathetically unbelievable; the actual details of what the cult was up to, and to what degree it interacted or steered clear of the central murders, was hazy in the extreme; and the personal story of the killer's connection to the Tuttle clan was underexplained. Not only did this slightly dampen the effect of the last half hour, but it will also, I think, make the idea of rewatching the series less compelling.Copyright 2018 © New Republic.

739	 Ratings Once Upon a Time, Revenge, True Detective 0 Comment March 10, 2014There’s quite a bit of good stuff to get to here when we are talking about the ratings for Sunday night, in particular when it comes to some shows that really managed to both surprise and impress.What’s one of those shows? “True Detective,” which was deceptively the biggest hit of 2014 so far. HBO’s live ratings have never really been a full indication of their shows’ success, but this is especially true in this instance. The finale drew a series-high 3.5 million viewers, but when you look at the average gross audience, which combines repeat viewings and streams on the HBO GO app (which gave some viewers trouble last night), the show brought in a pretty impressive haul of over 11 million viewers an episode. That’s the best for any HBO show in a first season since “Six Feet Under.” Pretty darn impressive when you remember that “Game of Thrones” and “True Blood” are also both in the network’s stable.As for some other important ratings news:1. Who expected that “Resurrection” was going to be the enormous beast for ABC that it was? Despite airing against “The Walking Dead,” the show brought in a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic and also 13+ million viewers. Let’s hope that the network sticks to keeping this a limited series, since that is probably what gets so many viewers to actually tune in.2. “Once Upon a Time” delivered a solid 2.3 in its return to television, a sign that ABC got the scheduling right this time. “Revenge” also managed to actually win the 10:00 p.m. hour in its first go of things there with a 1.9, which was probably helped by its lead-in.3. “Cosmos” on Fox delivered a solid 2.1 in its premiere, which was also yet another sign that Fox really loves anything on Sunday night that has Seth MacFarlane’s name on it.Want more TV news that is delivered right to you?

740	"The final episode of HBO's breakout hit True Detective was watched by millions on their cable feeds last night, but many viewers tuning in online via HBO GO didn't have it that easy.

Complaints about poor service started popping up on Twitter and a Reddit sub dedicated to True Detective shortly after the 9 p.m. ET start of the eighth and final episode of the series. The show, created by Nic Pizzolatto, follows two detectives played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson during their decades-long search for a cultish killer in the Louisiana bayous. The narrative winds up being equal parts whodunit, nihilist bromance, and name check on obscure weird fiction tales from the 19th century.

As the Internet blew up Sunday night with kvetching about the no show by HBO GO, the network tweeted this:

Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.— HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014

Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.
Several hours later, everything seemed to be resolved, though not without leaving millions of True Detective fans gnashing their teeth about their own descent into an online Carcosa featuring the flat circle of time as an endless buffering loop:

And, for those of you who aren't stuck in HBO Go-Cosa, here is your True Detective GIFcap. Middle fingers forever: http://t.co/yVQx8eD1qa— Vulture (@vulture) March 10, 2014

And, for those of you who aren't stuck in HBO Go-Cosa, here is your True Detective GIFcap. Middle fingers forever: http://t.co/yVQx8eD1qa
""Due to overwhelming interest in the season finale of True Detective, HBO GO was hit with an excessive amount of traffic soon after 9 p.m. ET last night. The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal,"" an HBO GO spokesperson said in an email sent to PCMag on Monday.

So how many True Detective viewers were affected by the service disruption? The show has averaged nearly 11 million viewers a week over its eight-episode run, according to The Daily Beast. That's about 38 percent of HBO's estimated 28.7 million subscribers, the site noted, leaning on stats from media research firm SNL Kagan.

And how many of those subscribers tried to watch the series finale online? That's tough to say, though as Grantland's John Lopez quipped, perhaps the biggest revelation of True Detective turned out to be that ""HBO GO has a limit to how many people can share their passwords at one time: 11 million.""

Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) had a lot to say about life, philosophy and beer on HBO's True Detective, which wrapped its first season Sunday night.[This piece contains a detailed discussion of Sunday night's True Detective finale. If you haven't seen it and you plan to see it and you don't want to know what happens, stop reading.][Seriously, information ahoy.]Spoiler alert: The dirty-faced, crazy-talking, disheveled impoverished guy did it.Because we are talking about True Detective, this tells you very little, since Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) spent most of these eight episodes moving through a landscape of desperately poor, semi-coherent, literally unwashed people who might or might not be monsters. And in the end, one of them was. And after an almost comically lengthy sequence in which Rust, gun at the ready, tracked him through a labyrinthine maze of increasingly intricate wooden structures, he knifed Russ, put a hatchet in Marty, and then got shot in the head. The bad guy died, and the good guys lived.Marty's wife and daughters returned to him, and he and Rust lived to share a lovely talk about near-death experiences in which Rust essentially ended (once you made out what the heck that last line even was) on a vaguely positive note.There was a lot to admire about True Detective: As many before me have stated, it contained two of the best performances television's celebrated ""golden age"" has offered from Harrelson and McConaughey, and its tone and aesthetic were often gorgeously realized, as in a stunning shot of a road weaving through an array of forked white trees.Creator Nic Pizzolatto knew exactly what he was going for when it comes to tone, and he went for it consistently, skillfully and inventively. The car chats between Rust and Marty, in which Rust was allowed to echo the great philosophers and Marty was allowed, at times, to put a pin in his grandiose blather, were fantastic from the start, and they kept being fantastic right through the reunion of the two in the 2012 scenes. (I particularly enjoyed Rust's self-consciously poetic reference to humanity as ""sentient meat,"" followed by Marty's puzzled, ""What's scented meat?"" Indeed, Marty. Indeed.) He's an enormously stylish writer and, together with director Cary Fukunaga, he created a gorgeously immersive universe.But True Detective is still a detective show, and it devoted a lot of real estate to its central mystery, which ultimately led to little more than ""a monster in the woods did it."" Little things that seemed like clues — the repetitions of five figures standing in a circle, the now notorious ""yellow king"" business, the mystical chattering from various witnesses — just sort of turned out to mean ""a bunch of crazy people used to do crazy, monstrous stuff out in the woods."" Certainly, the false resolution to the case in 1995 allowed for a couple of critical character moments, particularly Rust saving Marty from being prosecuted for blowing a guy's head off in anger. But an awful lot of time was spent mucking around with some pretty cliched visions of drug dealers who sort of had nothing to do with anything.I don't think Pizzolatto cared at all about the drug stuff in the early-middle part of the show, which is why those episodes got so slack and dull. The personal stories at that time weren't at their best, either; they were focused on Marty's affair and his violent beating of a guy who made the mistake of being with a woman Marty believed he owned. Other than the heavily hyped long take at the end of the fourth episode that wound its way through the disastrous undercover operation, the show didn't really make a lot of headway between the end of the pilot and the fifth episode, at which point it became more about the complicated interplay between Marty and Rust, and thus became instantly more interesting. In the end, it was gripping in the pilot, slow in episodes 2 to 4, terrific in episodes 5 to 7, and very ordinary in the finale.What True Detective felt, in the end, was unedited. It felt like it needed another pass, where someone could have told Pizzolatto when Rust was tipping over from an intriguing portrait into a caricature, and when there needed to be a little more story in the story.Pizzolatto told Alan Sepinwall after the finale that to believe Rust is full of it is to believe Nietzsche is full of it:For people who thought Cohle's philosophy was simply hogwash, be aware that you're calling Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche hogwash. Just be aware of that. That is not, in fact, a college freshman stoned eating a pizza talking about life; that's Arthur Schopenhauer's thoughts on life.With all due respect to Pizzolatto's commitment to great philosophers, college freshmen have, in fact, been known to get stoned, eat pizza, quite correctly quote Nietzsche, and still be utterly full of patoot. The issue was never whether the substance of Rust's philosophy was invalid; it was whether Rust's way of talking about it felt more sophisticated or more affected — more like a philosopher or more like a dialogue writer. The very long ""time is a flat circle"" conversation, for instance, amounted to a very long interpretation of the idea of history repeating itself, which, without more, isn't something one necessarily needs to hear a character explain in great detail while the show surrounds it with indicators of portent.Kept in perspective, as a very uneven but ultimately highly creative passion project that features some of the best acting you'll see on any screen of any size this year, True Detective is entirely successful. What it isn't is great. To make great television is to understand its episodic structure and to pace it properly. To make a great mystery is to make the conclusion seem like a culmination of the work that has gone into the solution rather than a sense that time expired, so the monster on the hook at the time the music stops is as good a solution to the mystery as any other.We'd be lucky to have more showrunners as ambitious as Pizzolatto was about trying to say something about good and evil and philosophy, and certainly to have directors as skilled as Fukunaga at creating memorable visuals. But there turned out to be less here than sometimes met the eye, and in the end, a lot of evidentiary traps were set and never sprung.Monkey See is all about pop culture, aspiring to be both a friend to the geek and a translator for the confused.

742	"Brilliant, weird noir series True Detective had its season finale last night, and the ending probably wasn't what most viewers expected. There were a lot of problems with the way this mystery was resolved, but the show did do one thing gloriously right. Spoilers ahead!I'm going to start with what I consider to be the season finale's master stroke. GOOD: The Ending Didn't Answer All Our QuestionsWhat I loved about this episode was that all the most elaborate theories that fans spun out turned out to be wrong. The series didn't become meta-commentary about how we're all trapped in a narrative, nor did we ever discover the true meanings of Carcosa and the Yellow King. Instead, it turned out that the guy killing kids was indeed (as we suspected for at least two episodes) Errol Childress, a schizophrenic child molester who had himself been abused as a child. He was working with a few friends who were also child molesters.Before you get all freaked out and start yelling at me that THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER MEANINGS — yes, I grant you that, and I will talk about them in a second. But for now, just sit back and consider that if you simply look at what the story gave us, we are left with absolutely no explanation for why Errol and his buddies were obsessed with Carcosa and the Yellow King. Why the antlers and the spirals and stick pyramids? There is no explanation other than Errol's insanity. We do see a gloriously spooky Yellow King in Errol's murder cave, and Rust hallucinates Carcosa (I loved that moment), but we never find out who came up with this imagery or what it means. It just gets explained away in one line about ""child molesters into voodoo."" AdvertisementWe also never truly find out how many members of the Tuttle/Childress clan are involved in the child sacrifice rituals. When Rust frets about this in the hospital after he and Marty have caught and killed Errol, Marty basically tells him to shut up. Of course the evil men in power weren't caught, he says to Rust. ""That ain't what kind of world it is,"" he continues. ""But we got ours.""AdvertisementBasically, this part of the ending was perfect. Nothing is resolved, and that's true to the realist spirit of the series.It also served as an example of Rust's nihilist philosophy. There is no meaning in anything. It's all just a bunch of sentient meatsacks repeating the horrors they've experienced over and over. Looked at in that way, it was the perfect nose-thumbing at fans who searched like crazy for deeper meanings in this story. Humans are doomed to look for meaning where none exists.And now, here's where the episode went terribly wrong.BAD: The White Trash VillainFor a show that has been so nuanced and smart about how Louisiana's downfall is the result of powerful men abusing its citizens, this ending was about as stupid as you can get when it comes to politics. In an earlier episode, we learned that serial killer Errol was basically the product of the abusive Sam Tuttle, father to a political dynasty that spans government, the church and law enforcement. We also know he was victimized by his father, his face burned when he was a child.AdvertisementTo underscore how much Errol is still a part of this powerful family, we discovered in last night's episode that he's living in what seems to be a broken-down mansion, possibly even the old Tuttle estate, and his crimes have been covered up with the help of his powerful family — some of whom participate in this death rituals. And yet when we finally do see Errol in his element, he's collapsed down into the worst kind of caricature of white trash. I felt like I was watching Redneck Zombies, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, that episode of X-Files with the two brothers who keep their mother under the bed. The episode begins with him telling his ""daddy,"" who is tied up mostly naked in a shack, that he might bring him water if he's good. Then he traipses over to his mansion, speaking in a variety of accents for no discernible reason, to have sex with his sister in piles of filth. His body and his sister's body are displayed for the camera as the ultimate grotesques, and later when Marty explores their mansion it's clear that we are meant to feel nauseated by these hoarder scum.AdvertisementIt felt as if the entire series had been building up to a real revelation about the rottenness at the heart of Louisiana, but instead we just got this impoverished guy having sex with his sister and acting out the perfect stereotype of poor Southern whites. Instead of a political or even a spiritual explanation for the murders, we're basically told that this is just what trash does. They're just crazy and disgusting. Sure, their awfulness is connected to the tidied-up nastiness of the Tuttles, but we never actually see the Reverend Tuttle traipsing about semi-naked fucking his sister. I don't mean that I think Rust and Marty should have busted the whole Tuttle clan. That's not realistic, and I'm glad the show insisted on reminding us that rich criminals don't come to justice. What I mean is that ultimately the horrors we've seen, and the Carcosa death art, are all ultimately traced back to Errol's handiwork. His mind has spawned this horror, and his voice haunts the Yellow King's shrine.We are left with an image of Errol's maimed, obese body and filth-encrusted house as the source of all the series' darkness. This feels much too simple, and too pat. Previous episodes gave us such inventive, subtle and realistic examples of horror, from a perverted justice system to a charter school system that churns out ignorant children. Instead of giving us a meaty, complex villain whose name might well be ""Louisiana,"" this season finale gave us an absurd, fantastical stereotype. AdvertisementEvil, this episode suggests, is white trash crossed with voodoo religion. Somehow, the victims of Louisiana's power elite became the perpetrators in this episode. It feels like a betrayal of everything that came before.BAD: The Happy EndingAs I said earlier, I can forgive the show for never explaining any of the elaborate symbols of the five beer can people and M-Brane theory and obscure 19th century weird fiction. I think it's a bold way to spank the audience for trying to make meaning out of the void. Plus, there are a zillion productive ways people can analyze what the Yellow King and Carcosa meant, and how it ties into the Tuttle Ministries. AdvertisementYou don't need a tidy ""this is what it all meant"" ending to enjoy all the visual references and literary analogies in this series. In fact, a pat ending would shut down symbols whose power comes from their very ambiguity.That said, the writer/director pair of Nic Pizzolatto and Cary Joji Fukunaga made a seriously bizarre decision to end this season happily, with suicidal pessimist Rust finally seeing the light. Literally. We get a final speech from him about how when he was in a coma he felt the texture of a new kind of darkness beneath the other darkness — the ""form"" in the void perhaps — and felt the pure love of his dead daughter there. And now, when he looks at the darkness of the night sky with its sparse spray of illuminated stars, he believes ""the light is winning.""AdvertisementBecause . . . why? I get that he's resolved this major problem that's been plaguing him for a decade, and that he's repaired his (actually pretty adorable) relationship with Marty. And I'm glad he's gotten some relief from his sense that life is meaningless. He even got to cry in a manly way with Marty. But this ending feels tacked on, and not in an ironic way.I am a big proponent of character arcs that show us how people change over time. But this transformation feels like what happens in the final moments of horror movies when the characters escape from the demon in the caves, or the monster in their dreams, or the serial killers in the woods, and suddenly the birds are singing and the police are there to rescue them and a stagey mood of relief pours over everyone as the credits roll. I think a semi-legitimate argument could be made that this ending is kind of like the fakey-fake happy ending of Blue Velvet, where the mechanical bird sings outside the sitcom-colored kitchen after everybody has been raped and nearly murdered, etc. If that was Pizzolatto and Fukunaga's intent, it didn't really work. AdvertisementThis show was weird emo gothic, not irony-laced postmodernism. There's no reason it couldn't have been both, but it wasn't. I think a lot of us responded intensely to True Detective because it was so incredibly earnest. That's what made it heartbreaking and involving. Regardless of whether the happy ending was intended seriously or ironically, it sold out a show whose intentions were pure and whose characters sought justice in their own personal hells. I'm going to have to class True Detective's first season with so many other shows that were great until the final episode(s) and then lost their way. I still love this show, but I would have preferred no ending at all to this one."	Entertainment
743	"LACEY TERRELL/HBOListen to our True Detective Spoiler Special, in which our critics debate the season finale:Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece about True Detective’s relationship to its female characters, in which I argued that the superficial and sometimes exploitative way that it treated the women who appeared on the show—prostitutes, corpses, mistresses, a nagging wife—was intentional, a reflection of its heroes’ blinkered worldview and the very masculine, Southern cop culture they inhabited, and not the show’s own perspective.Welp.Willa Paskin is Slate’s television critic.Last night’s finale made a hash of my case. Would that it had not. The series was not oblivious to questions of female representation—the show’s writer and creator Nic Pizzolatto has said as much—but women remained ancillary to the end. The women who appeared in the finale were Errol Childress’s damaged half-sister, a backwoods creature in lust to Errol—a man who, despite being a horrifying monster, was shown to be more than adequate at pleasuring her—and also Marty’s family, who appeared at his hospital bed, mostly as an excuse to give us a long close-up on Marty’s sobbing face. Like almost all the supporting characters on this show, the women were just sketches—occasionally naked ones—compared to our full-bodied detectives. The show’s major crimes involved endemic brutality against women and children, and victims is all that the women of this show remained, people against whom various wrongs were committed.No TV show has an obligation to be everything to everyone. True Detective is a series I admired and enjoyed, and its treatment of women is not even the thing that irked me most about the finale, which left a number of niggling questions unanswered and finished on a ""let there be light"" riff. But it’s worth lingering on True Detective’s woman problem in part because that problem is closely, if not intentionally, tied to the show’s massive success: When it comes to prestige TV, there has yet to be a downside to out-bro-ing yourself.In eight short weeks, True Detective has been granted greatest-show-on-television status on an extremely accelerated schedule. I understand why: McConaughey and Harrelson have been outstanding, their characters indelible. It looks great. It has been enticingly plotted, bread crumbs of Carcosa thick on the ground. If Rust’s banter hewed toward the dorm room, it felt authentically dorm-room: pretentious, sure, but also intelligent. And yet, there are other shows out there that traverse much of the same territory as True Detective—Top of the Lake, The Americans, Broadchurch, The Fall, to name a few—and none of them have gotten the frenzied attention of True Detective. None of those shows are on HBO. None of them feature movie stars. None of them seem explicitly built to appeal to Reddit users. But also—not unrelatedly—they are about women.Top Comment
    
        
            Well, you can't really say that black people were represented very well in that show.  Two decent characters (that apparently can't figure anything out) and a ton of gang bangers.  How about religious people?  More...

Last week, Mo Ryan published a piece about the number of dramas for premium cable that have been made by women. The number is completely laughable (except that it made me want to cry). Premium cable dramas, the prestige category par excellence, are shows created by men that are largely about men, the rare exceptions—Buffy, Battlestar Galactica, and Homeland—only proving the rule. (See also Brett Martin’s Difficult Men, a history of the recent golden age of television that makes this point with its title.) The “best dramas of all time,” that four-way race between Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Wire, and The Sopranos, with Deadwood or Twin Peaks or Buffy tossed in for variety on occasion, are all exceedingly male shows, playing around with male-centric cop, mobster, and druglord genres.True Detective slots into the great drama conversation because it, too, is a great-looking, beautifully acted show that expands upon genre pleasures with very heady themes. But it also takes the machismo even further. The antihero may be played out, but he is an indictment of a certain kind of masculinity. We are drawn to Walter White and Tony Soprano (and Frank Underwood for that matter) even though we know we should be disgusted by them. Antihero shows are an enactment of unthinking hero worship, one that implicates its audience. But Rust and Marty are not antiheroes, whatever Rust says about being a “bad man.” They are just heroes. In the visual language of the finale, Rust is basically Jesus Christ. True Detective is not an interrogation of masculinity, it is a celebration of one, with none of the squishy girl stuff getting in the way. (There is no conversation to have about how the viewers of True Detective wrongly disparaged Maggie in the way that Breaking Bad fans misogynistically denigrated Skyler because True Detective never even let Maggie be enough of a character to get in Marty or Rust’s way.)I’m not saying that women can’t or don’t like True Detective. Obviously, I like True Detective. But I think whatever else it is, True Detective is an unfettered celebration of two men, men whose flaws and doubts and mistakes only make them more heroic, and this has been integral to the show becoming a phenomenon. The series has a lady problem, yes, but it is also a bro bonanza. It looks and feels like an all-time great drama, not just because of its production values, performances, and themes. It also looks like an all-time great drama because it’s mostly men on the screen.Read more of Slate's True Detective coverage.Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

747	"'True Detective' Director Cary Fukunaga on Rustin Cohle's Final SceneDirector also opens up about show's symbology and his favorite parts to filmWhile creator Nic Pizzolatto is already plumbing the seamy underbelly of America&apos;s transportation system for True Detective&apos;s second season, director Cary Fukunaga spoke to Vulture about Sunday night&apos;s gripping finale and letting Matthew McConaughey do his thing for Rust Cohle&apos;s final soliloquy. (Spoilers ahead!)""We only did three takes on that, and I think that was the last take that we wound up using,"" Fukunaga said. ""I just let Matthew go. We rolled one take into the next, and that’s where he got to on his own. The conversations we’ve had about where he was at psychologically and physically were all part of getting to that but in terms of shaping his performance at that moment? I didn’t have to do anything.""5 things we learned from True DetectiveElsewhere in the interview, Fukunaga addressed some of the finale&apos;s eeriest elements, like the labyrinth Cohle and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) track serial killer Errol Childress through. The scene was originally set in a cypress forest, but when they had to re-plan the ending, Fukunaga pitched Fort Macomb outside of New Orleans ""as if the cult had taken over some factory or something on the bayou and repurposed it,"" said Fukunaga.""Childress had turned it into some cat-and-mouse-like maze to entrap these children and adolescents,"" he said. ""There was a bridal path described in the script that a larger section of chambers in the fort worked perfectly for. It’s hard to tell but there&apos;s a spiral-like nature to the maze and once you get to the final section before the altar room, the funnel grows smaller and smaller and smaller.""The many spirals littered throughout True Detective reached an apex during the episode as well when Cohle hallucinated a massive vortex before being attacked by Errol in the altar room. While Fukunaga wouldn&apos;t say how Pizzolatto originally envisioned that moment for fear he might get in trouble, he said the formation Cohle sees creates a neat bookend for that crucial symbol. ""I liked the idea that we could actually see Carcosa and black stars,"" he added. ""If you look really closely, you can see black orbs floating in it. It was important to me that if we&apos;re gonna talk about these things, let&apos;s see them one more time before we finish.""Fukunaga also spoke about striking a balance between the show&apos;s two detectives throughout the first season&apos;s run: While Cohle and his philosophizing became the centerpiece of True Detective for many fans, the director said he felt Hart&apos;s troubled relationship with his family was its true heart.""I always felt those interactions with the family were the most tangible examples of how behavior affects those around you,"" Fukunaga said. ""Cohle is this lone wolf on the outside and he can philosophize but you don&apos;t really see how he or his behavior affects other people. He&apos;s purposely isolated. There were more scenes with Hart&apos;s family that didn’t make it into the show, about his daughter and his relationship with Maggie. I always found that stuff the most interesting to shoot in terms of human drama.""While Pizzolatto will be behind True Detective&apos;s second season, Fukunaga will not return. Still, the director offered up some advice to whoever takes the helm next year: ""&apos;You can email me.&apos; We didn&apos;t finish until a couple weeks ago. I guess, &apos;Start training now.&apos; It&apos;s a doozy.""Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.Please enable javascript to sign up for the newsletter.How we use your email addressWhat is this?"

749	"Partly cloudy.Partly cloudy. Low 31F. Winds ENE at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: February 12, 2018 @ 4:06 pmMatthew McConaughey as Rust Cohle and Woody Harrelson as Marty Hart in HBO's ""True Detective,"" which wrapped up its eight episode run Sunday night.Editor’s note: If you haven’t seen the finale of “True Detective” yet, stop reading now. Spoilers, and more spoilers, are ahead.Going into Sunday night’s “True Detective” series finale, I expected the ending to be dark and depressing.But, against all odds, the buzz-worthy HBO series was wrapped up in a way that could be described as happy. Or, if not outright happy, then slightly more positive than any of us could have expected.Both of our leads survived and got their (very creepy) guy, while Matthew McConaughey’s cynical, detached Rust Cohle seemed to find peace about the death of his daughter and possibly even a belief in some kind of higher power, an idea he’d previously made fun of others for even entertaining.Despite all of that, my knee-jerk reaction was to feel a little disappointed with the conclusion to the mystery part of the series.I shouldn’t be surprised; many, me included, have said that “True Detective” is more about the men than the mystery. The relationship between Rust and Woody Harrelson’s Marty Hart has always been the driving force behind the series, so it’s fitting that their character development would be where it all ends.But network procedurals have conditioned me to expect an explanation for the behavior of the unsub — to steal a term from “True Detective’s” polar opposite in quality, “Criminal Minds” — even if it’s as simple as he/she was completely insane. Which is most likely the case for Errol Childress, the serial killer Rust and Marty have been chasing all season long.  Early in the episode, we got glimpses of Errol's twisted life. He lived in a hoarder’s paradise with his half-sister, with whom he shared an incestuous relationship; his father’s dead body was tied to a bed in a smaller house nearby, the walls covered with insane ramblings, scrawled in bright red.When Rust and Marty arrived to confront Errol, a chase ensued, leading them both into the heart of literal darkness: Some kind of underground temple/maze, where all kinds of horrors had no doubt occurred over the years. Rust navigated his way through the maze, creepiness waiting around nearly every corner — and this, folks, was the part of the episode where I was watching through my fingers.Errol somehow got the drop on both cops, showing some almost superhuman feats that I actually bought.I’m still not sure how Rust survived their encounter; Errol stabbed him and then lifted him off the ground by the blade of the knife stuck in his gut. I’ve seen characters survive lesser injuries elsewhere and thought Rust was a goner for sure.Then Marty arrived and got a shot off before Errol threw a tomahawk that landed squarely in his chest. More fighting ensued, until Rust finally delivered the kill shot.Then it was back to the Rust-and-Marty show, as the action focused on both men’s recoveries and, in Rust’s case, a possible spiritual awakening when he was near-death.  The acting was superb, as was the action and overall atmosphere.I just wanted to know more. Where were all the other men who’d participated in Errol’s satanic cult? Have they, like the Rev. Billy Tuttle, simply died off, and Errol was the last of their breed? What was the deal with his father, and why was he keeping his dead body tied to a bed? Who, or what, was the Yellow King?So many questions! But none of them take away from the absolute brilliance of this series, or the amazing performances of both McConaughey and Harrelson.It’s been a wild ride, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.Contact Casey Gillis at (434) 385-5525 or cgillis@newsadvance.com.

750	By Emily NussbaumMarch 10, 2014Two weeks ago, I published a critical article about HBO’s “True Detective” in which I argued that, as stylish and as well acted as the series was, it had a hollow center. Beneath its auteurist trappings, the show boiled down to bickering cops hunting a sinister “rape club”—a plot that has been done to death, so to speak, on many better shows. “True Detective” also had a funky gender problem: it was about the evil of men who treat women as lurid props, but the show treated women as lurid props. And, though the dialogue was deeply, sometimes deadly serious, those layers of Lovecraft and nihilism just felt like red herrings.Well, as of the finale, I’ve changed my mind about one thing, at least: Rust Cohle’s monologues weren’t window dressing. They were the whole point—but I don’t mean that in a good way. In the finale, we discovered that the Spaghetti Man—a.k.a. the lawnmower man, a.k.a. the hulking guy with scars—was indeed our serial killer. A perverted mastermind with a cave full of skulls and thorns, he was diddling his disabled sister inside their Grey Gardens wreck of a mansion; he also had some serious elder abuse going on, a plot that gave me flashbacks to the hilarious movie “Cold Comfort Farm” (“I saw something nasty in the woodshed!”). I relished this surreal, sick, and frankly nasty opening sequence, which led deep into the territory of the notorious “X-Files” episode “Home,” but after that everything went downhill.To summarize: Our boys intimidated a corrupt cop with a videotape (he howled upon seeing the un-seeable, then screamed “Chain of command!”). They Googled documents and visited witnesses and had Sherlockian insights about green paint. There was a meeting with one of the African-American cops, who turned out to be the good cop. There were endless conversations in the car, about issues like whether Rust held back in that fistfight, and about Rust’s argument that Marty should be blamed for “pushing a good woman to the point where she had to use me.” (Of course, Maggie couldn’t have actually wanted to screw Rust, out of revenge or because the man had been flexing his arms at her for years; that would mean she had desires beyond being a plot device.)About two-thirds of the way into the hour, there was an extended game of Marco Polo in the ruins, a truly ridiculous head butt, two stabbings, and a gunshot. No involvement of Marty’s father-in-law; no payoff on the goth daughter angle; no payoff on a lot of things, actually, like that mysterious convict who died in his cell. “Errol” was behind all the show’s central crimes: he’d participated in drugging a prostitute and decorating her in antlers; he’d helped organize the “Eyes Wide Shut” club with the girls in blindfolds; he was behind the kiddie-porn preschool molestation in the school basement; and then, of course, there was that ancient incestuous family to tend. He also got solid ratings as a housepainter. The masked figures behind the larger conspiracy went free, including the powerful Tuttle family—although I haven’t entirely sorted out the details, maybe because so many of them didn’t make any sense.There was a hospital scene between Marty and his wife and kids that was so abstract, it might as well have featured a silent-movie card reading “Forgiven!” And, over the show’s last twenty minutes, as in the finale of “Lost,” the series became a meditation on how our heroes healed from their psychic wounds and became buddies again. Marty was “fine, just fine,” recovered from years of Match Personals and TV dinners. Rust had a touching dream about his dead daughter, in which he glimpsed light beneath the darkness. They were able to move on, to forgive themselves for their own mistakes (Marty) or find optimism in their nihilism (Rust).I am certain there are people who found all this experimental and profound. To me, it was a near-total wash. And what was most striking was that every one of show’s gross-out victims—the dead “prosts,” the raped little girls with the blindfolds, the genderqueer hooker who had been raped as a boy and filmed for porn movies, Marty’s own screwed-up daughter—were just there to ease our heroes into these epiphanies. After all that talk about how the two men hadn’t “averted their eyes” to evil, the show did just that. And it ends with stories told in the stars? We’re in Successories territory here, and even great actors can’t pull that off.As I said in the review, it’s no fun to pan a show that people love (pleasure is an argument for itself, after all). But I’ll certainly be relieved when this series stops blocking people’s view of the other television that’s out there, including the mysteries I touched on in my piece, like “Top of the Lake” and “The Fall,” as well as “Broadchurch,” “Spiral,” “The Returned,” and the terrific new season of “The Americans”—varied and excellent thrillers that got far less press than “True Detective,” in part because they didn’t have the imprimatur of HBO and manly movie stars. The second season of “Orange Is the New Black” is on its way, and so is “Game of Thrones.” Fingers crossed that there’s some other drama in my pile of screeners to show me fresh possibilities!

752	This review discusses plot points from the full run of True Detective in detail.“The light is winning,” True Detective’s Rust concedes at the end of the HBO hit’s first season. Or it’s got the momentum, at least, even if the deficit displayed on the scoreboard remains monumental. After seven-plus hours of his paeans to darkness and the inexorable pointlessness and tragedy of human existence, Rust’s closing line throws everything that came before it into a very different, well, light.A number of critics (including on this site) find fault with that last-second reversal, labeling it a betrayal or holding it as emblematic of the show’s ultimate punt on many of the big questions of power, corruption, violence, and institutions’ control of individuals that it had seemed to raise. But it’s worth setting the question of whether or not True Detective kept its thematic promises aside for at least a moment to appreciate the technical craftsmanship of the storytelling that brings Rust through the improbable arc.True Detective is built around binary relationships — optimist and pessimist, cop and crook, faithful and bereft. The usefulness and failings of these binaries are a recurring background presence in the season, and in some ways the show has more to say about binaries than it does about any of its plot-level ideas. Rust’s concession (or perhaps it’s a revelation of some long-lit and tightly guarded spark of optimism in him, which could explain why a committed pessimist who’s bad at parties would bother not just to bear witness to the “raw deal” nature’s offered humankind, but to be police, to be one of the bad men who keep other bad men from the door) is a shift in one of these binaries, and it’s worth examining it specifically to think about the broader structure that drove the HBO hit’s first season.Throughout True Detective’s first season, creator Nic Pizzolato relies upon two combating shapes: the open spiral and the closed circle. “Time is a flat circle,” in Rust’s idle (and meme-friendly) philosophizing, and Pizzolatto’s camera finds visual examples of that closed loop notion in highway interchanges and the bottoms of Lone Star tallboys and the drum magazine on Reggie Ledoux’s AK-47. Spirals adorn Childress’ victims and one is scarred into his own flesh just below the nape of his neck — a location that means someone else had to have carved the shape into his body — to say nothing of the spiral-ish labyrinth that hosts his final showdown with our heroes. If the dominant geometry of human history and experience is Rust’s “flat circle” — where everything repeats, where free will is an illusion, where humanity marches witlessly around some sort of existential grindstone — then fighting crime and catching bad guys and mourning our long-dead toddlers is all pointless playacting.The spiral, on the other hand, makes for a more hopeful metaphor for existence. Whether they collapse inward or wind outward from their centers, spirals suggest progress from one state to another, implying an uncertain future that can be influenced by present action. The intoxicating nihilism of Rust’s “flat circle” speech and the abstract brutality of the largely-unseen cultists for whom the spiral is a unifying symbol suggest there’s only one assessment of which notion of human existence is right and which is evil.By converting Rust from a despairing advocate of circular history to a reluctant adherent to the heartening, spiraling idea that light has been bringing the universe closer and closer to a tie ballgame, True Detective reverses its original stance on this symbolic stand-in for philosophical inquiry.We know the symbolic reversal of that moral binary matters a great deal, since symbolism is so essential to how True Detective works. The show is rampant with the stuff, and its leads are walking symbols of diametrically opposed values systems. The DNA of each man’s worldview is on hardly-veiled display in their very names. “Rust Cohle,” the corrosive and elemental force of brute rationalism, rendering life’s mysteries into plain inevitabilities of time and force, in the same way the earth’s internal forces turn carbon into coal. “Marty Hart,” whose gut goes slack in retirement, the heart-driven man who turns into Fat Marty, Mardi Gras, the guiltless intuiter and womanizer who’s good with people and great at the version of grade-school show-and-tell that adults call happy hour. Here, too, Pizzolatto organizes his clearest symbolic language within a binary structure, while also choosing one that is marked by classic cultural ideas of manhood and its rightful place in society.More broadly, binaries are easy for an audience, and here they created a very engaging playground. But binaries are also simplistic and deceptive. The masculine binary that animates True Detective crowded out a lot of the shadowy complexity that attends real-world institutional conspiracies around power, murder, and sex. It also seems to flatter some classic cultural notions about strong, tough, brooding men being both rightful arbiters of good and evil and sufficient protection from the latter.In choosing to locate his story within the Rust-Marty dynamic, Pizzolatto foreclosed a great many possibilities including that of female characters who are fully human or who demonstrate agency outside of how their lives collide with the menfolk they orbit. The space Pizzolatto clears with his choices gets allocated to spooky atmospherics and layers of conspiracy that implicate the most powerful political and religious figures in True Detective’s Louisiana in a drug-fueled ritual-based murder and pedophilia cult cobbled together from scraps of mainline Christianity and transgressive literary traditions. Other shows that handle similar subject matter have made very different choices about how to approach incest and violence against women and provoked very different kinds of contemplation. Taken together, art like Top of the Lake and The Fall and August: Osage Countyand True Detective serve as patches in a quilt of ideas about those subjects.Some of those patches approach this material with a sure and settled viewpoint and find the right characters to bring that viewpoint to fierce and even triumphant life. Others function more as mirrors than as declarations, and I’d argue True Detective is one of these. Those old, flawed ideas about hard men keeping us as safe as we are docile and loyal that Rust represents? The show’s resolution calls all of them into question, as they fail to net any of the powerful men and institutions that were participating in the Carcosa cult and settle for destroying only its most prolific member. Those binary notions of how we should be and how we should view our species and our place in space-time get dislodged by the show’s conclusion. It isn’t that the spirals vs. circles, Marty vs. Rust, good vs. evil dynamics get resolved in surprising ways, it’s that they prove irresolvable and false by the time it’s all over. Rather than endorsing one or another clear or doctrinaire worldview or conception of reality, True Detective suggests its best to lean on a pastiche of many different elements, in much the same way that Adam Gopnik recently argued that the rump plurality of non-atheist non-religious people have set out to do for themselves in defiance of the self-appointed authority of both Pope Francis and Richard Dawkins alike.“This world is a veil,” the revival-tent preacher with the Elvis haircut says in one early-season episode. As it turns out, that idea is a better representation of what True Detective has to say about human nature than anything. The spirals and circles, crowns and Yellow Kings, philosophizers and affable broskis are all feints at an orderliness that the real world never actually exhibits on its own. We think we’re making sense of the world around us, but we’ve made it into a veil that is legible to high-functioning animal neurology built to identify important patterns or to create them where none exist. The questions we think are worth asking and the binaries that seem worth organizing your life around prove useless.	Entertainment
753	Culminating a remarkable first season in fine, moving form, True Detective’s finale, titled “Form and Void,” took us to the heart of darkness at the vortex center of its weird fiction — as well as  the final stage of its meta-commentary on the stories we tell ourselves, about ourselves, for better and worse. It was a tale that ripped dark marks on our bellies, then soothed us by “making flowers” on us. So to speak.We start on the outskirts of the infernal plane. We begin in hell on earth. The ersatz underworld of The Yellow King — a.k.a. Errol Childress, a perverse product of paternal abuse, generational evil, and his own deranged, pop-culture informed myth-making — was a theater of the mind for a fantasy made real: His vision of Carcosa, the necropolis of Ambrose Bierce and the fallen world of Robert W. Chambers, littered with dead trees and body bags. Childress lured Cohle into his ascension chamber — the staging area for so many murders, and last night, a stage for an ancient ritual, the oldest story of all. Light versus dark. Good versus evil. “Little priest” versus wannabe Elder God. It was The Real World: Dungeons and Dragons, and Cohle, hard boiled to the core, was ready to play. I’ll see your abyss and gaze right back, Lawnmower Man!He was fooling himself. Rust Cohle has always been fooling himself. His cynicism, his callousness were parts of the mask he wore to engage the world, to deal with himself. But it offered no protection when his mind — tweaking from the fetid evil around him — conspired against him and waylaid him with a vision of a coal-black vortex spiraling down to claim him. Maybe you were thinking: They’re going to do it! Cthulhu is coming! Coming to take us away, ha-ha! Ho-ho! Hee-hee! Beam me up, Lovecraft!But no. It was gotcha moment, for Rust, and for us. Childress seized him and cut him to the core, literally and spiritually, like a knife to an empty can of Lone Star. “TAKE OFF YOUR MASK!” The Monster bellowed. It was as if Childress was telling him to cut the phony bologna nihilist crap, the useful fairy tale of baggy and buggy sentient meat denying his truth. Of course, you can say the same of his agent of enlightenment, his doppelganger. True Detective was always all about authenticity — or rather, the lack thereof, and the stories we tell ourselves  to get us through the day (religion, or nothingness, or our private Carcosas) and in turn imprint (and inflict) upon the world.What happened after Rust’s gutting exposes us as well: the final 15 minutes of “Form and Void” struck me as a Rorschach test for what you want from stories like this, for what we’ve come to call “resolution,” And boy, did we get a lot of it, both implied and explicitly stated, no more so during the last scene, with all of its mansplaining and bromantic uplift. Yes, uplift. The twist ending of True Detective’s bleak first season: a bracing refutation of its baroque pessimism. Cohle and Hart slayed the decadently dandy slumdog (schizo?) psycho at dream’s end, spent a good chunk of time processing their feelings and baring their souls, then exited, stage right, to star in The Odd Couple sitcom we’ll never get to see. They were as stunned by this turn of events as we were. Cohle and Hart, flawed heroes and failed men, expected to be destroyed by their bid to pay the debt they owed the world, and so did I. If you had told me four episodes ago, after Rust’s ugly Crash digression and Marty’s complete unraveling, that we’d get a happy ending in which they’d be laughing and hugging and telling stories about the stars — like myth-making bards of antiquity — I would have thought you were a sauce-knackered tent preacher. What does say that about me? Perhaps a lifetime spent consuming stories has shaped my imagination to assume the worst. Or maybe I’m just, like, a really hideous person.And so instead of losing their lives, Cohle and Hart were rewarded with new life. Marty found a little redemption — but not too much — and reconciliation he thought beyond him. Rust found some catharsis for the past, triggered by a near-death experience as his sense of self was becoming incoherent and fading away: A feeling of love and connection with his dead daughter and his beloved father. He wanted to sink and dissipate into that deep: “I said, ‘Darkness, yeah! [Instant classic McConaughey-ism!] And then I woke up,” said Cohle, despairing that what felt so metaphysically real was only a dream. Still, in this moment, we truly saw Cohle for the first time: He shed his last layer to reveal the profound grief that drove him. Wow. I thought we would get a grim and gritty climax that affirmed a gloomy worldview; we thought we would get Chinatown. Instead, we got the deconstruction of hipster/pulp cynicism that says heroism is a crock and the recovery of old school virtue; we got Casablanca.A toast to Cohle and Hart, who deserve to be the penultimate* final statement on an era of anti-heroism and hideous men: Here’s to the beginning of a beautiful relationship.*I think Don Draper should get the final word on this, don’t you?THE FASCINATION WITH ABOMINATIONIn which we spend a few hundred words making sense of The Yellow King.We won’t be forgetting Errol Childress anytime soon. The collaboration of writing, directing, set and performance (Glenn Fleshler, terrific) in “Form and Void” combined to produce a memorable portrait of decadent, demented evil that was rich with layers and allusions and subtext.The facts, as I understood them. Errol made his home in the boonies beyond the Creole Nature Trail. He kept his dead father — another lawless lawman and corrupt Tuttle, who with other Tuttles abused him and warped him and sewed his psyche with their perverse private religion — bound and lip-tied. He kept house with his half-sister. Made “flowers” on her, too. (Ewww.) He had stacks and stacks of books, magazines and DVDs in his trashed, fly-swarmed, fetid home. (Was The King In Yellow somewhere in those stacks?) He watched a lot of TV. (That was North by Northwest on the telly.) He was a man of many voices — Andy Griffith, Slingblade, James Mason — and seemingly no fixed identity.But the intelligence behind those masks did fancy itself something monstrous. Errol lived to make his mark on the world by abducting and raping and killing children in ritualistic fashion with the help of his low-life cousins — his “acolytes” — the Ledoux brother, and littering the landscape with devil nets, occult graffiti, a Christian woman slain and transmogrified into an art object that mocked her faith. All were ironic reminders that evil roamed the land with impunity, and no one could — or would — stop him. Certainly not God. It bothered Errol, though, that no one had detected his handiwork: “Oh, if they had eyes to see,” he said. The implication: Errol wanted to be discovered. What’s more, he wanted to expose the family that had made him, that used him, that… worshipped him? And then there was the matter of Errol’s last great project: His “ascension.” He made a reference to tying off the endless loop of his life — his own circle of violence and degradation — and checking out — “I am near the final stage. Some mornings, I can see the infernal plane.”I am taken by the notion that Errol wanted to end his life by producing a story — his last ritual — in which he would play the part of The Great Adversary. He just needed some worthy Hero-Christs to play their parts in the play. He finally got them — after years of waiting? — in the form of Cohle and Hart. In that moment in the field, when Cohle told Errol to freeze, and Errol said “No,” Errol wanted the detectives to follow him into his labyrinth. A grand battle ensued — Errol wasn’t going to make it easy; our boys had to earn it — and Errol got his death-wish made true by Cohle, no stranger to death-wishes. Cohle shot him in the head, and the image we got framed Errol’s exploding head within the hole in the roof of his chamber. Behold Errol’s violent enlightenment, his ascension, his storytelling mission accomplished.Of the many details that defined Errol, I am thinking most at present about all that pop culture lying around his house. Errol’s story concluded one of True Detective’s themes/morals: Be careful what you put in your head. You spend your days filling your head with pictures of evil (Cohle, ep. 3), you spend your days filling your imagination with faces of evil and stories about evil (Errol, and his Carcosa-crazed family, Hitchcock flicks, and who knows what else Errol kept lying around), you spend your days fascinated with abomination, and chances are, they’re going to affect the way you see the world.+++Heading into the finale, I saw several pieces lobbying for a “no resolution” ending to True Detective. No hard answers, no final declarations. Resist the desire to be just like any other cop show! Their argument was that True Detective wasn’t really about the murders and rapes and the ritualistic desecration of children and women, wasn’t really about its mysteries of history and corruption and secrets and lies. It was about the characters of Cohle and Hart, and their charged bromance, and Cohle’s ridiculous philosophizing, and Hart being a dork, and the world, and the landscape, and the existential unknowability of absolute truth and the mood — oh, the gloriously fetid mood.I respectfully disagree. It’s a misread of the story to argue that True Detective has always been resolution-agnostic, that it should have given us an ending with question marks instead of periods. The first six episodes were narratively driven by Cohle and Hart’s storytelling, but we see now — and this is important and not to be overlooked — that the story was always framed by two detectives searching for truth: Papania and Gilbough, who we now know to be righteous, honorable cops. The portraits of Cohle and Hart that emerged depicted obsolete modes of masculinity and worldviews, who were unworthy of the heroism that was required of them — but became so by submitting to total deconstruction.The last two episodes saw Cohle and Hart taking responsibility for a broken world that they helped to break. I loved how this was expressed in the procedural scenes, and I was grateful we got a lot of them in the past two weeks. It was great seeing the detectives actually be detectives — especially diligent, thorough Hart, who made the key connection that put them in the road to Childress. Even Cohle was impressed: “F— you, man!” High praise!Bottom line: The organizing principle of True Detective was restoring law to a lawless land. Telling me to not care about that — to not want resolution for that — is to be cynical about character transformation. It asks me to not care about justice. And that’s what “resolution” meant here: justice. There is a kind of existential pulp that can get away with moral ambiguity (Breaking Bad), or supernatural existentialism that can get away without explaining its metaphysics (Lost). This was neither.Yes, it was earnest. It certainly defied common medical sense: How the hell did Rust survive that gutting? Dude plunged that blade deep into his belly, lifted him off the ground and let him hang and tear a little on its jagged edge. Ouch! But it was interesting how the final 15 minutes gave us a series of very distinct scenes, each representing a different kind of ending that could have worked for both this story and this kind of story, yet worked together to create another meaning altogether:Do you like your pulp colder than Jack Nicholson’s naughty bits at the end of The Shining? Then remember forever Hart cradling Cohle — both bleeding to death — looking up into the empty eye of God formed by the opening in the ceiling in Childress’ ascension chamber, seeing a flare — a flicker of hope — and crying out: “Here! We’re here!” Basically: The Book of Job, before the restoration.Do you prefer some resolution but not complete resolution? Then remember forever our fallen warriors in the hospital: Hart reunited with family, suddenly feeling healed, then remembering he is not, that his encounter with horror has left him far afield from anything like “fine.” And Cohle, looking hollowed and husked — a grizzled, lost Frodo after his awful apocalypse at Mount Doom.Do you need happy ending uplift? Then remember forever Hart coaching Cohle toward hope and stars, and Cohle tearfully recognizing that his protest-too-much nihilism has been so much sound and fury, and both men hobbling away, arm in arm.Taken together, all those scenes created a nuanced climax. Kudos to True Detective for not making too much of Cohle and Hart’s heroic achievement. Yes, it felt mythic, but that’s because we got a climax set in The Yellow King’s fraudulent “psychosphere,” and most of it from Cohle’s muddled perspective. Cohle the Pulp Christ so wanted the grandiose knock-out punch — what a way to go out, to tie off the vicious circle of violence and degradation, both in himself and in his culture; to solve the problem of evil once and for all! (Take THAT, Silent God!) But Hart corrected him, right-sized him; that was not their job, not their fight, and really, nothing they were qualified for. This small chapter of the never-ending story was more than enough and screwed them up good. Leave the rest to the next generation. Leave it to the duly empowered (and totally righteous) Gilbough and Papania.And this why I loved that True Detective let Cohle and Hart live — or rather, made them live. Their “rewards” for saving the day? Shredded illusions. Painful self awareness. The opportunity to spend all of their remaining years trying to get over the horror, the horror. The only real feel-good compensations? They get each other; they get to figure their sh– out together. My favorite parts of the finale? When Hart called Cohle his “friend;” when Cohle entrusted a man he found so easy to judge with this weakness and tears.Yeah, yeah: CORNY. But I buy it. Because it’s true. And I’ll take it from almost any story, flaws and all, if I feel it earned it. And I say True Detective did.	Entertainment

Preacher Joel Theriot delivers the message, episode 3(Image by HBO screen capture)   Permission   Details   DMCA  - Advertisement -

 This world is a veil and the face you wear is not your own. Preacher Joel Theriot, True DetectiveTent preacher Joel Theriot's full sermon from episode three of True Detective
 provides a preview and explanation of detective Rust Cohle's conversion
 from a laconic nihilist extraordinaire who can barely live with himself
 to an enlightened soul with some prospect for peace.In episode 7, Cohle laments his long journey through violence and depravity then says I'm ready to tie it off.  
 Many suspected that this forecast death for Cohle in the final 
episode.  In a very real sense, that theory proved correct but it was a 
different type of death.As it turns out, True Detective is
 the story of a seeker of truth.  Rust Cohle's moment of enlightenment 
in episode 8 came after years of searching and suffering.The most elegant and revealing statement of Cohle's struggle and revelation is, in my opinion, the sermon delivered by Joel Theriot in episode 3, The Locked Room. 
 The seemingly less than sophisticated preacher and an audience of those
 at the margins of life in rural Louisiana hide the profound message 
delivered for those willing to listen.  Episode 3 shows only a portion 
of the sermon.  The entire sequence is available on YouTube and is well worth watching (several times).The
 sermon represent a narrative map for the broader story told throughout 
the series, which reaches a climax  at the end of the season finale.  Of
 note, preacher Theriot is of the evangelical school of Christianity.  
He both delivers the sermon to and experiences it with the congregation 
as indicated by their frequent, fervent  interaction.  There are no 
strictures, admonitions, or rules; just the presentation of a higher 
wisdom and path to inner peace available to everyone with ears to hear.  Theriot's sermon is in italics along with my comments.He saw you in those dark corners.  He heard you.  Oh brothers, he heard those thoughts.The question, are you there?Since
 the death of his daughter, Cohle has suffered unrelenting guilt for 
failing to protect her. For years, Cohle has been the only person 
listening to his thoughts.  No one else is there.  He is alone without 
comfort.Would
 that we had ears to hear, because every moment, every now is an 
answer.  Every beat of every heart, every second of every minute, every 
minute of every hour, every hour of every day is an answer.And the answer is yes, yes, yes.Theriot has a forceful answer to the question Are you there?  He is and he is with us every moment.  But what does he represent.  Everything in the scene tells us that he
 is Jesus.  But we don't hear the name Jesus until four minutes into the
 six-minute sermon.  Cohle and partner Marty Hart are seen at the back 
of the tent watching Theriot preach.  Cohle's nonchalant attitude, 
leaning against the tent post is more than disinterest.  It represents 
contempt from the Cohle we know up to this point.  (In the final airing 
of this episode, he says to Marty:  What do you think the average IQ of this crew is?  I see a propensity for obesity, poverty and fairy tales.)  Your
 sorrows pin you to this place.  They divide you from what your heart 
knows.  "" We bandaged our soft selves in hardness and anger.  You are a 
stranger to yourself and yet he knows you.  And, when your hard heart 
made you like unto the stone and broke you from his body - which is the 
stars and the wind between the stars - he knew you.  He knew you yet and
 forever.  Because I ask you, how could a father forget his children?Cohle became a stranger to himself as a result of hardness and anger due to the death of his daughter.  He was so hardened to the world, so profoundly skeptical and alienated, it broke Cohle from his body; separated him from the embrace and protection of the peace surrounding him at the time of his greatest need.If ever your sorrow becomes such a burden that you forget yourself, forget this world, I want you to remember this truth""This world is a veil and the face you wear is not your own.Next Page  1   |  2

755	"*** Spoiler Warning***“I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution,” Mathew McConaughey’s Rust Cohle said during the first episode of “True Detective” but by the end of the series his philosophy reworked itself and reached a moment of contented acceptance.“Once there was only dark,” he said before the series came to a close. “If you ask me, the light is winning.”“True Detective” is HBO’s newest addition to the long list of shows you have to see because enough people around you have raved about it. And like most shows on that list, it’s worth it. The series tells of two Louisianan detectives (McConaughey’s Cohle and Woody Harrelson’s Marty Hart) who spend 17 years working a case involving murder, Satanism and the deranged. The final episode aired last night. Like all good finales it completed the story and left each viewer the task of piecing it all together for themselves.Cohle and Hart spent the series tracking and searching for a disturbed mass murderer of women and children. Grotesque, gothic symbols of flat circles and crowns appeared throughout their case that created a complex and dark labyrinth for both detectives.Parallel to this story of psycho crime is the journey of each man as he battles his demons of regret and pain. For Cohle, his daughter’s death and the acceptance of living alongside life’s darkness acted as the basis of his troubles while Hart struggled with allowing himself to be vulnerable and loving with his family. Both men’s baggage were prominent plot points in “True Detective” but these were never the reasons why you were told to watch along.The show played a smooth bait and switch where incredible six-minute tracking shot sequences and mysterious horrors snatched our attention while the crux of the story was truly about two different men coming to terms with themselves.What made “True Detective” stand out from other crime shows and whodunit scenarios is the way it kept it simple while persuading the audience to participate like a Sherlock on a sofa. There weren’t any major plot twists or “Don’t Stop Believing”-induced confusions in the finale. Instead we watched Cohle and Hart reach a fulfilled ending. Hart cries with his ex-wife and children, finally allowing himself to be honest and powerless among them and Cohle embraces the true love he had for his deceased daughter establishing substance in his hollow life. It’s a simple but gratifying ending. Tell us what you think:

757	"UsernamePasswordRemember meForgot your password?advertisementadvertisementThis show ran for only eight episodes -- but they had a running time of approximately one hour
each, which roughly equals ten episodes of a broadcast or basic cable series when factoring in time lost to commercial pods. That was just enough to build and maintain interest without the show
becoming a chore to stay with, as sometimes happens with even the best series. It also made for easy catch-ups during the season and for comfortable aftermath binges. Eight hours might kill one day,
but it won’t destroy a weekend. To look at it another way, with its episodes strung together the first arc of “True Detective” could be thought of as an eight-hour movie.Regardless, series formats and models are suddenly in play as never before. One can forgive anybody who is feeling a sense of confusion about the issue. Perhaps this guide will help, especially as
the Upfront season approaches and dozens of networks suddenly dump hundreds of new programs of many kinds into a massive heap that advertisers and critics are supposed to process with unlimited
interest. (That worked in the old days of a three- or four-network Upfront, but now May has a madness all its own.)A mini-series has always been -- and should continue to be -- a one-time
closed-ended series that plays over several consecutive nights or weeks. Sundance’s “Top of the Lake” and BBC America’s “Fleming” are perfect recent examples, even
if they were considerably shorter than such legendary miniseries of the past as “Rich Man, Poor Man,” “Roots” and “North and South.”“True
Detective” and FX’s “American Horror Story” are looked upon as mini-series simply because that is the most convenient definition, and I suppose it fits. But each season of
“AHS” continues to build an over-arching brand, as I’m certain future seasons of “Detective” will also do. I think these are the true “event” series of our
time, rather than mere “minis,” because the return of the brand each year does qualify as something new and special.Ongoing broadcast series that are scheduled outside of the
traditional broadcast season -- like CBS’ “Under the Dome” and “Extant” and Fox’s upcoming “24: Live Another Day” -- are currently being referred to as
“event” series. But as long as they continue season to season with the same characters and continuous story lines they should be regarded as “regular” series --  as they
would be on basic and pay cable -- and nothing more. (I haven’t seen it, but I’m already thinking of “Live Another Day” as a ninth season of “24,” rather than some
kind of stand-alone “event,” even if it is only twelve episodes, a dramatic departure from its past model -- which, we shouldn’t forget, had gotten stale).“Regular” series continue to be reshaped and rescheduled in all kinds of ways. I consider BBC America’s superb back-from-the-dead drama “In the Flesh” to be a regular
series, because it has seasons that continue the same story lines with the same characters. It matters not that the first season was only three episodes long (which, minus commercial time, comes out
to one longish theatrical movie). The same is true of BBC America’s “Broadchurch” and Sundance’s “The Returned” (a French import) with their eight-episode cycles of
ongoing stories or new stories with ongoing characters.Streaming series like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black” are “regular” series
masquerading as “events” because that’s exactly what they are for most people who adjust their lives around them to consume them in their entirety as quickly as possible. So, for now
anyway, Netflix gets to have it both ways. I suppose it can be argued that any series anywhere can be gobbled up in so hurried a manner, making anything a potential event, but that’s not the
intent of the original scheduling, which still counts for something, or ought to. I don’t think networks are ready to concede that their first-run prime-time real estate is nothing more than a
shelf on which to display fresh product intended to be enjoyed at some non-specific future time, like DVDs on a shelf at Target or anything in a Netflix queue.      Thank you for a very thoughtful article, Ed. The concept of a limited series always sounds compelling but the economics problematic. Hopefully after such gems as Broadchurch and True Detective (a wow) the industry will experiment with more variations.

This morning, a dull, gray dawn broke on a dull, gray “True Detective”-less world. The show that has had us gripped for the last eight weeks (or the last weekend for compulsive binge watchers—hi there!) came to an end in either a blaze of HBOGO-crashing glory, or a fizzle of HBOGO-crashing disappointment, depending on your point of view. We’re much more in the former camp than the latter, so much so that we found our usual Good vs. Bad approach wanting this time around, purely because after a couple of niggles we were really reaching for anything particularly bad to say about it. Not to sound uncritical, folks, but with only a few holdouts, we loved this show to distraction, so we’re simply going to jot down a few thoughts about the finale (which you can refresh your memory on with the last of our Kevin Jagernauth’s excellent recaps here) prior to looking ahead to season 2. This is a finale post, so do we really have to say there will be spoilers? There will be spoilers.






Thoughts on the finaleScope of the mysteryWe suppose the biggest issue that some might have regarding the finale is that the solution to the mystery is smaller, and some might say, safer than a lot of the speculation had suggested it might be. And it ends with the death of a single man—a terrifyingly fucked up, grotesque and insane man, but one not possessed by supernatural forces, or even gifted particular powers, with other major players in the catalogue of sick crimes still at large. But that was to us a source of great relief too—a cool debunking of the kind of referential mania that had set in where every single thing had Significance and Meaning and it all pointed to some impossibly complex and tortuous, potentially otherworldly conclusion in favor of something real-world, making it more enriching.In fact, we could go so far as to say it’s the show’s most successful bait-and-switch; just think about how all those “clues” (Audrey’s childhood sex drawings are maybe the best example) made us think about the relationships differently, even though they ultimately had no bearing on the mystery. Because this is a murder mystery show that is not about whodunnit, it’s about who solved it—it is about Cohle and Hart: their characters, their souls, and of course, their weird dynamic. By returning to that throughline for the finale, where some see the “safe” choice, we see the choice that was the bravest of all—staying true to these characters and not tumbling down the rabbit hole of endless overplotting.Resolution to Cohle and Hart’s relationshipWe might almost be tempted to chalk the “they become friends in the end” arc of Cohle and Hart’s relationship into the negative column, for a show that did so much differently to what we’ve come to expect. But damned if it didn’t do it so well that every moment between them in the hospital and beyond felt right, and earned and satisfying. And it culminated in that twinkle of uncharacteristic hope from Cohle (“the light’s winning”) that, whether it’s an homage to or a rip off from Alan Moore or not, feels like it made the whole journey worthwhile.






The climactic chase through the twiggy tunnelsWe have to shout out this sequence, because despite the points we’ve made above about it really being the story of a relationship and not the gothic horror blah blah blah, the show could do gothic horror really well too. And never better than here, in what has to be its tensest and most genuinely frightening scene. The fact that this late in the game it was still convincingly toying with the idea that there might be something truly uncanny and unkillable at the root of all this evil, and that it sustains that mood of dread so brilliantly, is a triumph of directorial vision and control—and set design, because, sheesh. That it all then culminates in a vision of a black hole which we retrospectively theorize could be the beginning of the hallucinatory trip that will bring a near-dead Cohle to his daughter (or an unholy confluence of Internet theories so fucking horrible they broke the space/time continuum to enter the show and distract him at nearly the cost of his life), is something that only a show this controlled in its craziness could ever have possibly gotten away with.What now for season 2? A great deal has already been written about what won’t be returning in season 2: no McConaughey/Cohle, no Harrelson/Hart, no Louisiana, no Cary Fukunaga (or single director, multiple helmers will likely take over), no canary-colored royalty. All of these elements together seem to constitute so much of what made the show great that we are forced to ask, what’s left? What can creator/writer Nic Pizzolatto possibly bring to season 2 that will make it not just as good as, but even recognizably the same show? With the writer himself teasing at this very early stage that season 2 will be about “hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system” here are the elements of season 1 that we really hope to see retained in what is clearly going to be a totally different story.Lying, storytelling and “truth”Director Cary Fukunaga was himself quick to tell us last year that the title “True Detective” was “not my choice,” and with the pulpy, tabloid-sensationalist feel it initially gave to a show that turned out to be much more intelligent and elegiac, safe to say we weren’t always fans either. But as the episodes progressed and more of the flashback/interview structure became discernible, we slightly changed our minds on that, and began to think it appropriate that there was some reference to truth in its title. Particularly exemplified by the sequence, which contains the already famous six-minute tracking shot of Cohle and the bikers, which is never related to the interviewing detectives (Cohle and Hart stick to the story that he went to visit his father), as well as, of course, their “heroic” moment which is narrated in such a way that their cover story plays over what actually happened, the show constantly played with the idea of truth, counterpointing it with cover-ups and lies. And it wasn’t just narrative tricksiness: again it was always revealing about the characters and their sometimes almost symbiotic relationships, and also their constructed and occasionally hypocritical ideas of themselves (viz Hart’s “all for the family” rationalization playing over scenes of him cheating). We’d love to see this level of thought-provoking counterpoint and storytelling inventiveness return (though obviously not in the a carbon-copy interview format), and with the job of detecting in general being about trying to “find the truth” and “construct a narrative” we can’t see why it wouldn’t.A Different kind of cop-partner relationshipObviously the cop-pair dynamic is one we’ve seen onscreen about sixteen billion times, and one of the pleasures of “True Detective” was that, until the very last episode at least, it had largely subverted all available archetypes. There was a prickliness in their relationship from the start, borne of totally different worldviews and philosophies (not just the old by-the-book guy meets maverick cliche), and if each man eventually made the other a better version of himself, Christ, was that wisdom ever hard-won and unpleasant to come by. There’s still quite some mileage in the idea that the guy (or woman) who has your back is also the person best placed to betray or manipulate you, and we hope this ambivalence finds its place in season 2.Sense of placeIf we won’t be returning to the lived-in Louisiana of season 1, and if in fact we can read some sort of national, or at least less parochial, scale into Pizzolatto’s comment about season 2 being about “the secret occult history of the United States transportation system,” we hope that won’t lessen the authenticity of the locations and the environments. The sense of an ancient place where family trees were as twisted and gnarled as those sinister twig sculptures, and where evil could lurk swamp-deep, and where even ordinary people could be genteel yet corrupt, was one of the great achievements of this show. And while any new setting will bring with it other characteristics, we hope as much time is invested in creating similar depth.Cinematography, production design, craftSeason 1 looked amazing. There’s the shotmaking, courtesy of Fukunaga and cinematographer Adam Arkapaw (also DP on “Top of the Lake”), from the bravura six-minute tracking shot, to the taillight shot—a personal favorite—to the tiara timelapse to Cohle in a shaft of sunlight in the creepy abandoned school and so on. And there are the incredibly intricate props and sets from production designer Alex DiGerlando, which you can read more about in this great Vulture piece (they built the burnt church…they built the church.) But with Fukunaga mentioning that just as he wouldn’t be returning as director for season 2, his collaborators might not be either (by reason of exhaustion), it’s possible that many of the people who made season 1 so unforgettably beautiful to look at might not automatically be back to lend their insane talents next time out. Not that they’ll have trouble finding people clamoring to be associated with what is now a smash hit, but still, we can’t help but feel season 2 has a lot of living up to do, on a craft level, to season 1’s high watermark.MusicSimilarly, the music throughout was pretty extraordinary (listen to it all again here), from the opening track that has haunted our every waking moment since we started watching and that made this probably the only show for which we’ve never fast-forwarded through the openings credits (also: credit design shout-out especially for the Woody/highways bit). Episode 4, “Who Goes There,” is probably the one that sticks most in mind at the moment on this level, for containing both this writer’s least favorite music cue of the season (the Grinderman track) and my most favorite (Lucinda Williams’ “Are You Alright?”), but in general this was peerless soundtracking, evocative and resonant and totally on theme throughout. More, please.And one final thing we’d like to see that we perhaps did not get enough of first time out:More central roles for womenThere is a criticism that the show’s women were underserved, and certainly their screen time is relatively minimal. We’d argue that was a side effect of those characters simply not being the focus of a story which was as much a depiction, and a very critical one, of socially-constructed masculinity in a very male-skewed profession and milieu, as anything else. And in fact, even with the lesser screen time, their characters had more agency than many lead female roles in other TV procedurals (with the eternal exception of the terrific “Top of the Lake“). But we’d certainly be happy to see women in more foregrounded roles next time out, because if Pizzolatto writes them with anything like the insight and inspiration that went into Cohle and Hart, he could address those criticisms and differentiate season 2 from the very outset. And it seems we might be in luck, as Pizzolatto not only mentions “hard women” in his summation of season 2, he did once tweet (since deleted) in response to a comment in this arena: “One of the detriments of only having two POV characters, both men (a structural necessity). Next season…”One boon for Pizzolatto and any future “True Detective” director on this and any other casting/crewing decision they have to make, is that we can’t imagine, after the blistering success of season 1, that they won’t have their pick of the crop when it comes to season 2. And with that, here we are at the end and we have to face the eerie void that is a year or so without any more “True Detective,” taking comfort only in Cohle’s assertion that “Nothing is ever over.” Talk us through the grief, or share your thoughts on where you want the show to go, below.This Article is related to: Features and tagged Cary Fukunaga, Feature, Features, Matthew McConaughey, Nic Pizzolatto, True Detective, TV Features, TV Reviews, Woody HarrelsonGet the latest IndieWire alerts and newsletters delivered directly to your inboxSubscribeWith Season 3 underway, Jones promises an unsettling season finale that will force TBS to pick up a Season 4.Screen Talk, episode 185: What do we make of the Tarantino backlash?

The best in streaming entertainment, from the experts.Use commas to separate multiple email addressesYour message has been sent.There was an error emailing this page.So it turns out this live streaming of popular TV programs is harder than it looks.“Watch now?” True Detective fans said through gritted teeth. “Why, I’d love to.”Viewers who opted to watch Sunday night’s finale of True Detective via HBO Go, the pay channel’s streaming app, were treated to the kind of shocking twist they probably could have done without: The streaming service went belly up shortly after the final episode began airing at 9 p.m. ET.And the reason you couldn’t watch True Detective on HBO Go Sunday night? According to HBO, it’s because too many of you were trying to watch True Detective at the same time.Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.To watch HBO Go, whether it’s viewing new episodes as they premiere or combing through the back catalog of HBO original programming, you’ve got to subscribe to the pay cable service—in theory. In practice, if you borrow the login information of a willing accomplice, you can watch HBO Go to your heart’s content. And you know what? HBO really isn’t going to stress about that.Paying customers, however, may feel differently after Sunday night’s streaming snafu. An article on Hypable (which I spotted thanks to the Washington Post) wonders if it’s not time for HBO to start tightening up the rules for its streaming app, which is available on mobile platforms as well as set-top boxes and gaming consoles. Specifically, the Hypable article suggests that HBO think about restricting the number of people who can log into any one HBO Go account at a given time. After all, this is the second high-profile season finale where HBO GO went belly up—last year’s Game of Thrones season-ender suffered similar issues.It’s also the second consecutive weekend in which your plans to stream a popular television broadcast may have gone awry. If you thought finding out the identity of the Yellow King was complicated, you should have tried streaming last week’s Oscar ceremony. Despite limiting the first-ever Oscar live stream to a handful of markets, ABC couldn’t deliver the telecast to viewers tuning in on mobile devices. The circumstances behind the Academy Awards and True Detective streaming failures are very different, of course, but both incidents go to show that traditional broadcasters are going to have to put in a lot more effort before streaming becomes as seamless as simply pressing the power button on your TV remote.HBO did have some good news on Monday, though:The issues affecting HBO GO last night have been resolved.

764	"What matters about True Detective season two isn’t so much the plot or the cast—it’s the genre. Season one won the internet’s attention partly through its heady plumbing of Lovecraftian mythos and blending it with Southern Gothicism. There’s no use trying to repeat that formula, so where else can the show turn to capture lightning in a bottle?This article is from the archive of our partner .So, early reports (i.e. this interview) suggest that season two of True Detective is going to be about “hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system.” Whatever that means. Ghost trains? Devil-worshipping conductors? The satanically slow speeds on Amtrak? We’ll leave Nic Pizzolatto to his scripting, but in our eyes, what matters about True Detective season two isn’t so much the plot or the cast—it’s the genre. Season one captured the internet’s attention partly through its heady plumbing of Lovecraftian mythos and blending it with Southern Gothicism. There’s no use trying to repeat that formula, so where else can the show turn to capture lightning in a bottle?Season one had a grand, governmental conspiracy weaved into its plot. Police reports were altered, Louisiana’s Senator was implicated, Rust Cohle was always fighting the system in one way or another. But as the show wound towards its conclusion, the big-picture stuff mostly fell away, and we were left with our two heroes going up against Errol in Carcosa. That’s fine, but why not go full Parallax View next time? Set it wherever you want—Washington, City Hall, some backwater town in Alaska. Get twisty and convoluted, but with that edgy, almost psychedelic element of madness that should come with any paranoia-based thriller. It really just sounds like I’m asking for HBO to produce season two of Rubicon. Well, that’s fine by me.The Following did its best to ruin Edgar Allen Poe for everyone by having its chief villain, Joe Carroll, worship the macabre author and base a cult around his writing. His acolytes wandered around in Poe masks setting people on fire, and then Kevin Bacon would show up, point at a crime scene, and say, “Classic Poe.” This offense must be corrected, and while I’m sure Pizzolatto will feel the topic is overplayed, I wish he’d step in to draw from Poe’s writing in a much more thematically appropriate matter. The man wrote some of the earliest detective fiction, after all, and had the sense of atmosphere that proved so crucial to True Detective’s first season.Season one of True Detective revolved around a Satanic Voodoo cult. What if next year we just go full pagan? The original 1973 Wicker Man is a deceptively creepy, shattering horror story disguised as a mystery, with a policeman investigating the disappearance of a girl on a remote British island. A bunch of no-good sex druids immediately start making trouble. It all sounds silly, and Neil LaBute’s horrendous Nicolas Cage-starring remake didn’t help that reputation, but there is something genuinely frightening and fascinating about being stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere. As long as there’s no Smoke Monster.Alright, this is as far-fetched as it gets. But a man can dream. If you really want to shake things up, nothing’s further from Carcosa than cyberspace, and there’s plenty of philosophical debate to plunder from the works of William Gibson or Neal Stephenson. Matthew McConaughey is coasting to a career revival partly on the back of True Detective—maybe it’s time for Keanu Reeves to enjoy the same renaissance? I look forward to much talk of “jacking in” and the “Metaverse.” Who am I kidding, there’s more of a chance that season two just ends up being about Rust Cohle and Marty Walsh chasing tail in an old folks home.This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.
    From the Mayan ballgame Pitz to ancient Greece’s bull-leaping, here’s a tour of the history of athletic games.
In the mid-1930s, the Federal Writers’ Project interviewed thousands of former slaves, some of whom claimed the president came to their plantations disguised as a beggar or a peddler, telling them they’d soon be free.Shortly before the election of 1860, a man came upon a plantation near Marlin, Texas, some 20 miles southeast of Waco. Though nobody knew who he was, the plantation owner took him in as a guest. The stranger paid close attention to how the enslaved people working on the plantation were treated—how they subsisted on a weekly ration of “four pounds of meat and a peck of meal,” how they were whipped and sometimes sold, resulting in the tearing apart of families. Eventually, the stranger said goodbye and went on his way, but a little while later he wrote a letter to the plantation owner, informing him he would soon have to free his slaves—“that everybody was going to have to, that the North was going to see to it.” The stranger told the owner to go into the room where he’d slept, and see where he’d carved his name into the headrest. And when the slaveholder went and looked, he saw the name: “A. Lincoln.”The fumbling of domestic-violence accusations against Rob Porter is a story about the administration’s inability to tell the truth, not its disorganization.The White House’s response to allegations of domestic violence against former Staff Secretary Rob Porter has so stunned reporters that the whole episode has become an exemplar of the total disorganization of the Trump administration.“Abuse Case Exposes Fissures in a White House in Turmoil,” The New York Times intones. Axios’s Jonathan Swan writes, “This is crazy. Even in a White House that’s famous for chaos, I’ve never seen anything like this.” Politico’s Playbook simply announced, “CHAOS at 1600 Pennsylvania.”This is peculiar, not only because it is difficult to imagine what would rise to the level of notable chaos relative to the standards of this White House. It’s strange because the focus on disorder has overshadowed the more salient feature of the moment: Insofar as the administration is engulfed in chaos, it is a result of its inability to tell the truth. The Trump team doesn’t have a chaos problem so much as it has a dishonesty problem. Of course this is not new, either—in fact, the serial dissembling of the White House has become so banal that it goes almost unremarked in this case—yet it is on particularly dramatic display here.Lawmakers scoffed at the president’s calls to slash funding across the government a year ago. With a new spending deal now in place, they’re likely to do so again.Within the thousands of pages the White House transmitted to Congress on Monday morning as part of President Trump’s second annual budget request, there is a line that pretty much sums up the whole ritual.“Many of the eliminations and reductions in this volume reflect a continuation of policies proposed in the 2018 President’s Budget that have not yet been enacted
by the Congress,” the sentence reads. It’s included in the introduction of a 222-page document titled “Major Savings and Reforms.”Those are all the cuts the Trump administration is proposing, and they’re going nowhere.Trump again wants to take a meat cleaver to the Environmental Protection Agency, chopping its budget by one-third. He’s asking Congress to scrap entirely community-development block grants and heating assistance for low-income housing. And he wants to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the national endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, and a slew of other independent agencies.Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald rose to the occasion with their paintings of the former president and first lady, while—importantly—continuing their radical projects in black portraiture.Jasmine, African blue lilies, and Chicago’s favorite flower, chrysanthemum, flourish in the botanical backdrop of President Barack Obama’s official portrait. The 44th president appears seated in an ornate chair, with leafy vines threatening to climb up his pant leg.In her official portrait, First Lady Michelle Obama appears seated, too, in a flowing dress designed by Milly. Between her gown, with its touches of geometric patterning, and the sky-blue paint that frames her figure, the painting features a lot of hard-edged abstraction.On Monday, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled the Obamas’ official portraits. President Obama’s portrait, by the Los Angeles–born and New York–based artist Kehinde Wiley, will join the museum’s hall of American presidents, where it will permanently disrupt the march of white presidential paintings. The portrait of Michelle Obama, the work of Baltimore’s Amy Sherald, will be on view with recent acquisitions through November 2018.From Donald Trump to recent op-eds, the male perspective remains—stubbornly, perniciously—the default point of view.The tweet, as so often happens, was at once shocking and deeply predictable.Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused—life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?That was President Trump, on Saturday, ostensibly reacting to the fact that, this week, allegations of domestic abuse led to the resignations of two high-level staffers at the White House. He was also, obliquely, weighing in on #MeToo. The president’s 48-word assessment of the reckoning so many Americans are painfully but productively engaged in made for rich (but thoroughly unsurprising) irony: Trump, of course, has been accused of sexual impropriety by 19 women—and has also been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault, and has also boasted, on national television, about advising friends to “be rougher” toward their wives, and has also been elected president of the United States. His tweet is revealing both in spite and because of those facts: “Peoples[sic],” in the plural; allegation, in the singular. The peoples meaning the “men’s”; the allegation—though in its context, the diminishing adjective is redundant—being a “mere” one.The surprise release of The Cloverfield Paradox, along with acquisitions of other schlocky genre movies, suggests the company is leaning in to its “direct-to-video” approach.Just a year ago, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Netflix was a big player. The streaming company was a little more than a year into releasing its own original movies for its subscribers, and it was looking for prestige hits to gain a foothold as a distributor Hollywood could take seriously. It acquired one of the best-reviewed films of the festival, Mudbound, for $12.5 million, and the Grand Jury Prize winner I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, among others. In terms of prestige, Netflix was lagging behind its competitor Amazon, which had nabbed a Best Picture nomination for its major Sundance acquisition of 2016, Manchester by the Sea. Maybe Netflix’s new slate of indie favorites would turn things around.Digital stardust won’t magically make future cities more affordable or resilient.The term “smart city” is interesting yet not important, because nobody defines it. “Smart” is a snazzy political label used by a modern alliance of leftist urbanites and tech industrialists.

765	"It's rare for a television show -- especially a drama that becomes a hit in its first season -- to totally scrap its existing characters and story line to start anew in Season 2. But that's what ""True Detective"" is doing -- at least, that is what it seems to be doing, based on the few clues that show creator Nic Pizzolatto has shared with television critics in recent interviews.HitFix's Alan Sepinwall notes that HBO hasn't officially ordered Season 2
 yet -- again, a stalling that's rare for a hit series so popular that it brings down its hosts site -- but surmises that this is ""because I suspect HBO is waiting until they've signed the actors they want before announcing.""There are a few things we do know about Season 2 of ""True Detective,"" however: Pizzolatto is currently ""fleshing it out,"" he told EW, and it will be about ""hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.""And the Chicago Tribune claims that Matthew McConaughey, who played detective Rust Cohle alongside Woody Harrelson as Marty Hart, won't be back:The show was always intended as an anthology with a new story each season. The surprise survival of both Rust Cohle and Marty Hart at the end of Season 1 suggested at least one could return, someday. But McConaughey has said he never planned to stay beyond one season. “It was a 450-page film, is what it was,” McConaughey said of the show's first season during a January Television Critics Association panel.  “It was also finite. It didn't mean we had to come back this year, next year if we were under contract. It was finite. So in that way it was exactly a 450-page film script.”Cohle and Hart are probably not coming back, but Pizzolatto has retained the literary rights to his protagonists. ""So maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out. Always a possibility,"" he told EW.And it's not just the cast and story that will change -- the entire directorial style, overseen in Season 1 by Cary Fukunaga, is likely to change, too. Pizzolatto told BuzzFeed via email:We don’t have any plans to work with one director again. It would be impossible to do this yearly as we need to be able to do post while we’re still filming, like any other show. There’s some great guys I’ve consulted, and we’re all confident we can achieve the same consistency. Going forward, I want the show’s aesthetic to remain determinedly naturalistic, with room for silences and vastness, and an emphasis on landscape and culture. And I hope a story that presents new characters in a new place with authenticity and resonance and an authorial voice consistent with this season. Dominant colors will change. South Louisiana was green and burnished gold.It seems like the freshman show is already being gutted, left with skeletal remains that, once filled in again, might not even resemble its original form. One thing that we do know about Season 1 that will carry over from season 2 -- perhaps the most important thing -- is that the philosophical detective drama will continue with the same spirit -- ""keep being strange."" ""Don't play the next one straight,"" Pizzolatto told HitFix.Copyright © 2018 Salon Media Group, Inc. Reproduction of material from any Salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited.

Whoever signs on to star in the very likely second season of True Detective has big shoes to fill.

The anthology's freshman finale, which brought an end to the story of Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey's 17-year murder case, brought in a series high 3.5 million viewers on Sunday night. That's up 50 percent from the premiere just two months ago.

What's more, the latest gross viewership for the show has an average 11 million viewers tuning in every week. When final DVR and HBO Go views are taken into account, that number stands to grow even more. It already ranks as the most-watched freshman series HBO has had since Six Feet Under in 2001.

Sunday's HBO Go crash is evident of widespread interest in the series, particularly from multi-platform viewers. The streaming service briefly shut down on Sunday night after the episode went live. ""Due to overwhelming interest in the season finale of True Detective, HBO Go was hit with an excessive amount of traffic soon after 9 p.m. ET last night,"" read a network statement. ""The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal.""

On TV, live-plus-same day returns for True Detective grew even more with an encore. Across plays, the finale brought in 4.9 million viewers -- also a high.

True Detective hasn't officially been renewed for a sophomore season, but it is very much in the cards. The strong ratings and critical buzz quickly led to an overall deal for creator-writer Nic Pizzolatto. An anthology series, True Detective would return with a new cast and new story.

In the end, the naysayers who accused HBOs True Detective of being sexist seem mostly irrelevant. Yes, it would be nice to see more top-notch hour-long dramas created by women and concerning women, particularly more women of color. But thats not what True Detective was intended to do.



At its heart, this was a story of male friendship, transcending macho rivalry and frat boy cavorting to ultimately be about guys saving each other.



A mystery wrapped in a religious cult conspiracy, slowly unfolded by two antiheroes  one a lying adulterer, the other an addict with pretentious theories about the meaning of life  ultimately was a male drama. The mission involved saving little girls, balancing the loss of one of the detectives little girl. But women didnt figure in, except as a plot twist to establish the two detectives antipathy.



Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey deserve applause, the creepy littered overgrown and horrific compound where the endgame played out deserves a nod for set design; T Bone Burnett deserves praise for the moody, even otherworldly music. But storywise, the eight episodes of this anthology series involved too many leaps and loopholes. The misdirection concerning the suspected pedophile priest, the Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle, was just confusing. How did he die? What did it matter?

Much of the gumshoes discovery happened by luck and chance rather than logic. Green ears? Green paint? A painter! The sudden rush of clues, leading neatly to the serial killer via work permits and job orders via computer, felt a bit pat after all the soul-searching, existential doubt and flashback interviewing.



The final scenes, with McConaughey dressed, positioned and coiffed to look like Jesus Christ, suggested more profundity than the show actually offered. Looking to the night sky for cosmic truths, Hart (Harrelson) and Cohle (McConaughey) again slip away from the authority figures (this time, its the hospital) to go it alone. Together.



Its all about good versus evil, light versus dark, Cohle concluded, and the lights winning.



Moody, unnerving, confusing  but surprisingly optimistic.



HBO Go crash



Meanwhile, the light may have been ascendant, but the electrons werent cooperating: The HBO Go streaming service collapsed, unable to feed demand for the finale Sunday. The network promptly scheduled a rerun, and the service on HBO cable was unaffected. The twitterverse had a field day (sample tweet: Congratulations to #TrueDetective for being the first show to literally break @HBOGO).

A mystery wrapped in a religious cult conspiracy, slowly unfolded by two antiheroes  one a lying adulterer, the other an addict with pretentious theories about the meaning of life  ultimately was a male drama. The mission involved saving little girls, balancing the loss of one of the detectives little girl. But women didnt figure in, except as a plot twist to establish the two detectives antipathy.



Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey deserve applause, the creepy littered overgrown and horrific compound where the endgame played out deserves a nod for set design; T Bone Burnett deserves praise for the moody, even otherworldly music. But storywise, the eight episodes of this anthology series involved too many leaps and loopholes. The misdirection concerning the suspected pedophile priest, the Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle, was just confusing. How did he die? What did it matter?

Much of the gumshoes discovery happened by luck and chance rather than logic. Green ears? Green paint? A painter! The sudden rush of clues, leading neatly to the serial killer via work permits and job orders via computer, felt a bit pat after all the soul-searching, existential doubt and flashback interviewing.



The final scenes, with McConaughey dressed, positioned and coiffed to look like Jesus Christ, suggested more profundity than the show actually offered. Looking to the night sky for cosmic truths, Hart (Harrelson) and Cohle (McConaughey) again slip away from the authority figures (this time, its the hospital) to go it alone. Together.



Its all about good versus evil, light versus dark, Cohle concluded, and the lights winning.



Moody, unnerving, confusing  but surprisingly optimistic.

772	"""True Detective"" wraps up the first season with a harrowing (and hopeful) episode.""True Detective"" wraps up the first season with a harrowing (and hopeful) episode. For the last few weeks, the internet has been exploding with various theories about ""True Detective."" There has been everything from think pieces by Andrew Romano at The Daily Beast, wacky fan theories all over the place, and even a wonderful Youtube video about the the Yellow King. It's all been a lot of fun to speculate about ""True Detective,"" the monster at the end of its dream and what all of Rust Cohle's philosophical soliloquies are really about. Now that we've reached the end I think many of us missed the point. (Although, I very much agree with Romano's piece about ""True Detective"" being an examination of storytelling and the power of storytelling. But there are a number of subtexts, meta-writing and philosophies at work on this series. It's one of the reasons this first season has been so great.) Now that's all said and done, I think ""True Detective"" is mainly about our two detectives, Rust and Martin Hart, and how they've changed. Creator Nic Pizzolatto has long said this is solely a story about these two detectives. Now, Pizzolatto uses these protagonists to expound a number of philosophies (Nietzsche and Tom Ligotti's excellent case for the pessimist viewpoint in ""The Conspiracy Against Human Beings""), literary references (Robert Chambers' ""The King in Yellow"") and ideas about religion that are utterly compelling. But for me, Pizzolatto did something amazing by examining the human condition through a focus on two men, and presented an outstanding case for the duality of human nature. As Rust said, ""Human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution"" responsible for all the evil in this world. While that's surely a valid point, Rust eventually finds beauty in human consciousness by the end of it all. Human consciousness has the potential for horrible things, but it can also create wonderful, powerful love. Through Rust and Marty, we see the capacity for change. Despite all of Rust's ""Time is a flat circle"" nihilism where nothing changes and ""nothing is solved,"" he does actually change, a lot, over the course of this 17-year story, as does Marty. For all the horrors Rust faced in his lifetime - tweakers injecting infant daughters with meth, Medea murdering mothers and the countless terrors from his four-year stint as an undercover Narco - only one thing forever changed him, the love between him and his daughter. Rust became a shell (sentient meat) of a soul after her death, and then found redemption in her undying love. The longer he refused to acknowledge the importance and power of human connection, the more of a toll it took on him mentally (his pessimism) and physically (his alcoholism). Some folks may complain about his final revelation. That an all-powerful love exists (even after death), and that this is a violation of who Rust was throughout the entire series. But I found it to be both a welcomed ""twist"" and somewhat hopeful ending that conveyed much of the contrasting ideas at play this season. (It also helped that Matthew McConaughey had one of his most powerfully gut-wrenching monologues in that final scene with Marty outside the hospital. Give that man all the awards.) And while Rust had the most dramatic transformation after the showdown with Errol William Childress in Carcosa - more on that below - Marty had a pretty big one too. Marty had always prided himself on his ""steady"" family man status, but had taken that family's love for granted, whether out of selfishness, pain or just obliviousness. Once he's visited by his daughters and ex-wife in the hospital he tries to tell them ""he's okay,"" but he can't lie anymore. He hasn't been okay for a longtime, and maybe if he'd realized it sooner his family would still be in the picture. Now that he has, maybe Marty can begin to make amends and find some peace, at least by being a father. Both Rust and Marty were immensely flawed men, though not as much as Reggie Ledoux or Errol. But they did some terrible things. Marty hurt a woman who loved him deeply and alienated his two daughters. If anyone, he epitomized Rust's words about ""The sin of being a father"" and just never realized it. While Rust claimed to have all the answers and was just ""A bad man keeping other bad men form the door,"" he actually wasn't. Rust Cohle was a very damaged person who could've easily given in to the darkness and fallen into the abyss of Carcosa. But he didn't because that love for his daughter and her love for him wouldn't let that happen, even if he only realized it much later. Now ""True Detective"" ended on a somewhat hopeful notion, even if many of the individuals involved in the Carcosa/Yellow King conspiracy will never be found out or brought to justice, and I'm glad about that. Rust and Marty, and many other people, had to suffer greatly throughout this season of ""True Detective,"" and presenting the power of undying love at the conclusion acted as a counterbalance to that suffering. Pizzolatto was showing the duality of human nature, how it could be corrupted and evil, but also loving and willing to fight that evil. This duality is exemplified by how different Rust and Marty were from each other, but also in how they were individually, conflicted souls waging a war within. For as much as ""True Detective"" was about the darkness, it felt completely organic to end on Rust's, ""Once there was only dark. If you ask me, light's winning."" And ""True Detective"" could've ended in the most horrific fashion imaginable. I began to think that was where we were headed after Errol seemed to get the upper-hand on Rust and Marty. And that final hunt through Carcosa - a hellhole of sickness and evil with the piles of children's clothes, retched skulls and devil nests, and a haunting chamber of death - and battle was just so well done. Kudos to Pizzolotta and Cary Joji Fukunaga for coming up with and executing a scene more frightening and intense than the climax to ""Silence of the Lambs."" Also, the opening look into the Childress household and ""making flowers"" - shudder - was super creepy. That Errol's Yellow King was a total psychopath created by generations of abusive psychopaths also fit with ""True Detective's"" theme about the responsibility of being a parent and how neglecting that can have dangerous outcomes. If Pizzolatto had decided to kill both Rust and Marty, the call never gets made for reinforcements and the murder of innocent women and children just continues, that would have been okay too. It would've fallen in direct correlation to Rust's pessimism and ideas that we're all just floating along in this ""thresher"" or ""giant gutter in space."" And it would have been a super ballsy and utterly tragic way to end this story. But I'm glad Rust and Marty found redemption and catharsis in the end. And I don't think I fully realized how much I would have been devastated if Errol did win, until it looked like he was going to. (It was hard enough to sleep last night. I don't think i could've if Errol was still out there.) Again, this was just a magnificent way for the story to unfold that left me on the edge of my seat. ""True Detective"" is already on my short list for best TV show of 2014, and I doubt it will unseated from the number one spot. It's early in the year, but this show was incredibly acted by McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and some of the smaller characters like Shea Whigham's Joel Theriot and Glenn Fleshler as Errol in the finale. ""True Detective"" was also beautifully directed by Fukunaga; every episode was just a masterpiece. But in the end, I'm giving the biggest hat tip to Pizzolatto. The narrative, and all the different subtexts swirling around inside of it, that Pizzolatto created was just brilliant when all was said and done. I didn't need for Marty's daughter found to be abused by the cult of the Yellow King, or for Marty's father-in-law to be involved. This was a messy end to a messy tale. There is still evil out there, and maybe Marty's daughter saw that evil first-hand. But there will always be evil and darkness in this world, especially if we don't see it explicitly. There's also a small, strong fragment of light that will hopefully shine on evil. And maybe that's what ""True Detective"" is really saying in this first season - that two men with inherent darkness found a way to let the light in, if only for an instant, and save themselves from a path of wickedness and sin. For the last few weeks, the internet has been exploding with various theories about ""True Detective."" There has been everything from think pieces by Andrew Romano at The Daily Beast, wacky fan theories all over the place, and even a wonderful Youtube video about the the Yellow King.It's all been a lot of fun to speculate about ""True Detective,"" the monster at the end of its dream and what all of Rust Cohle's philosophical soliloquies are really about.

But they did some terrible things. Marty hurt a woman who loved him deeply and alienated his two daughters. If anyone, he epitomized Rust's words about ""The sin of being a father"" and just never realized it. While Rust claimed to have all the answers and was just ""A bad man keeping other bad men form the door,"" he actually wasn't. Rust Cohle was a very damaged person who could've easily given in to the darkness and fallen into the abyss of Carcosa. But he didn't because that love for his daughter and her love for him wouldn't let that happen, even if he only realized it much later.Now ""True Detective"" ended on a somewhat hopeful notion, even if many of the individuals involved in the Carcosa/Yellow King conspiracy will never be found out or brought to justice, and I'm glad about that. Rust and Marty, and many other people, had to suffer greatly throughout this season of ""True Detective,"" and presenting the power of undying love at the conclusion acted as a counterbalance to that suffering. Pizzolatto was showing the duality of human nature, how it could be corrupted and evil, but also loving and willing to fight that evil. This duality is exemplified by how different Rust and Marty were from each other, but also in how they were individually, conflicted souls waging a war within. For as much as ""True Detective"" was about the darkness, it felt completely organic to end on Rust's, ""Once there was only dark. If you ask me, light's winning.""And ""True Detective"" could've ended in the most horrific fashion imaginable. I began to think that was where we were headed after Errol seemed to get the upper-hand on Rust and Marty. And that final hunt through Carcosa - a hellhole of sickness and evil with the piles of children's clothes, retched skulls and devil nests, and a haunting chamber of death - and battle was just so well done. Kudos to Pizzolotta and Cary Joji Fukunaga for coming up with and executing a scene more frightening and intense than the climax to ""Silence of the Lambs."" Also, the opening look into the Childress household and ""making flowers"" - shudder - was super creepy. That Errol's Yellow King was a total psychopath created by generations of abusive psychopaths also fit with ""True Detective's"" theme about the responsibility of being a parent and how neglecting that can have dangerous outcomes.If Pizzolatto had decided to kill both Rust and Marty, the call never gets made for reinforcements and the murder of innocent women and children just continues, that would have been okay too. It would've fallen in direct correlation to Rust's pessimism and ideas that we're all just floating along in this ""thresher"" or ""giant gutter in space."" And it would have been a super ballsy and utterly tragic way to end this story. But I'm glad Rust and Marty found redemption and catharsis in the end. And I don't think I fully realized how much I would have been devastated if Errol did win, until it looked like he was going to. (It was hard enough to sleep last night. I don't think i could've if Errol was still out there.) Again, this was just a magnificent way for the story to unfold that left me on the edge of my seat.""True Detective"" is already on my short list for best TV show of 2014, and I doubt it will unseated from the number one spot. It's early in the year, but this show was incredibly acted by McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and some of the smaller characters like Shea Whigham's Joel Theriot and Glenn Fleshler as Errol in the finale. ""True Detective"" was also beautifully directed by Fukunaga; every episode was just a masterpiece. But in the end, I'm giving the biggest hat tip to Pizzolatto.The narrative, and all the different subtexts swirling around inside of it, that Pizzolatto created was just brilliant when all was said and done. I didn't need for Marty's daughter found to be abused by the cult of the Yellow King, or for Marty's father-in-law to be involved. This was a messy end to a messy tale. There is still evil out there, and maybe Marty's daughter saw that evil first-hand. But there will always be evil and darkness in this world, especially if we don't see it explicitly. There's also a small, strong fragment of light that will hopefully shine on evil. And maybe that's what ""True Detective"" is really saying in this first season - that two men with inherent darkness found a way to let the light in, if only for an instant, and save themselves from a path of wickedness and sin. © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

            ""The anticipation-speculation that comes with a weekly schedule is a double-edged sword.""
          [Spoilers ahead if you have not seen the season finale of True Detective.] In the end, Marty and Rust found hope, a first step out of the heart of darkness, if not the answers to every last awful detail of the Childress family history. But before that, True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cary Fukunaga took us to the depths of hell and back. (Read our thorough recap of everything that went down in the finale here and our TV critic on the series as a whole here.) With Carcosa and Matthew McConaughey’s teary epiphany still on the brain Monday morning, Vulture spoke with Fukunaga about the many spinning theories still swirling (even now that the finale has aired) and putting together the show’s final chapter.There’s a lot of debate already about whether or not the finale settles the identity of the Yellow King — and whether it’s meant to be a person at all.I don’t necessarily think the final episode answered that, and I don’t think it was creator Nic Pizzolatto’s intention to answer that, even if people wanted it. It was more of an added layer to the reasons behind the killings. Rather than the Yellow King and the books about Carcosa and the mythology around that being the centerpiece for the finale, it was just another layer.What do you make of all the theorizing that went on around the show? The resolution to the murders was fairly straightforward — the crazy Spaghetti Monster did it — but there were many clues and Easter eggs planted along the way about this sprawling Tuttle/Childress/Ledoux conspiracy.Most of that was definitely deliberate — the lawnmower driving in circles at the end of episode seven, the use of spirals and stars. Some of it wasn’t intentional, like when the truck was driving by and there’s a yellow crown in the background. I’ve been sent a lot of this stuff because my agent is a huge fanboy. He sent me The Simpsons’ yellow king thing, and the one where the guy has an actual actor playing the yellow king. As much as we in development might have wanted to see the general sort of feeling of conspiracy and learn more about what this cult might have been about, the weight of the story needed to focus on Marty and Rust’s relationship.Looking at the comments on several reviews of the finale, there’s a particularly heavy obsession, borderline insanity, with why the “clues” about Marty’s daughter Audrey (the drawings, dolls, and crown) were never addressed.  I never read into what she was doing as having any relation to the crimes or the cult. I read Audrey’s behavior as being the direct result of an inattentive father. Seeking male attention in other places, or even seeking to get into trouble, perhaps, to get the attention of her father; it was not related to the killings or anyone around them. I don’t even remember seeing the spiral in her room. The general chatter around those things is great, but it’s probably the kind of chatter that wouldn’t have happened had all those episodes been released at once. The anticipation-speculation that comes with a weekly schedule is a double-edged sword. Because people have more time to talk about things, some crazy ideas get a lot of attention.The killer’s satanic labyrinth was incredible, almost like catacombs. Did you film that in a real location?Yeah, it was shot at Fort Macomb about 45 minutes outside of New Orleans. That scene was originally described as taking place in a cypress forest. A lot of locations were supposed to take place in a forest, including the meth compound and the original crime scene, but there’s not a whole lot of forests that are easy to shoot in around New Orleans. We had scouted that location for something else, actually. It was all chained and locked up and I like old things like that, especially Civil War things. When we got in, there were snakes everywhere and it was covered with weeds and grass. When we got to the inner chambers it was pretty awesome and really spooky and definitely had some weird energy around it.In re-planning the ending, I pitched the fort, as if the cult had taken over some factory or something on the bayou and repurposed it. Childress had turned it into some cat-and-mouse-like maze to entrap these children and adolescents. There was a bridal path described in the script that a larger section of chambers in the fort worked perfectly for. It’s hard to tell but there’s a spiral-like nature to the maze and once you get to the final section before the altar room, the funnel grows smaller and smaller and smaller. I kept using the rooms that led downstairs. By the last part, it’s almost like a womb. We did have to build the final octagonal altar room.Another of Rust’s hallucinations, this one a cosmic blue vortex, arrives at the worst possible moment. How was it described to you and what were you going for? I don’t know if I could tell you what Nic originally had envisioned without getting in trouble. We landed on the spiral formation of the clouds as a wrapping-up of the symbology, or at least a book-ending of the symbology. I liked the idea that we could actually see Carcosa and black stars. If you look really closely, you can see black orbs floating in it. It was important to me that if we’re gonna talk about these things, let’s see them one more time before we finish.What were you trying to do with that last sequence of vistas going back over all the places we’d been with Marty and Rust?Well, it’s the kind of problem-solving you do when you’re editing. There’s a 25-minute sequence that takes place in the hospital at the end, and it was hard to gauge time in there. It’s one scene after another took place in there. I felt like we needed some kind of break to allow the time jump from their conversation in the hospital to their final conversation outside at night. The only thing I could think of in terms of what we had was to revisit places that were important to the story itself of the characters.It seemed to play into the whole everything repeats/“time is a flat circle” theme.Well, yeah. Exactly. That’s why we chose those locations. I tried to find the setups we used that had the same camera movement, and to time it so it went from day to night. In fact, that last image of the tree over the cane stocks, that was from the first images we shot, the cane field burning. So the beginning is the end, the end is the beginning, which is nice. [Laughs.] We shot that a week or two before principal photography began. It was just me and the cinematographer Adam Arkapaw and our main first unit crew. That was actually the camera I was operating on the crane.Talk about working with Matthew on Rust’s final soliloquy. We only did three takes on that, and I think that was the last take that we wound up using. I just let Matthew go. We rolled one take into the next, and that’s where he got to on his own. The conversations we’ve had about where he was at psychologically and physically were all part of getting to that but in terms of shaping his performance at that moment? I didn’t have to do anything. Actually, the last thing we shot with Matthew, which was really great because we got to surprise him, was from episode seven when Marty’s watching the video tape Rust stole from the Tuttle house and Matthew has his back to Woody. We start rolling and I keep it going and we gather the entire crew right outside the storage unit. We slammed the doors open, which kind of shocked him for a second, and then the whole crew was there to clap for him. It was pretty awesome. It seemed like he got misty-eyed for a second, but then he was in complete control as Matthew, usually he is. He delivered a very nice speech to the whole group.The production designer said McConaughey went on a vision quest in that storage unit. That doesn’t surprise me at all.Did you get to go through his 450-page Rust file? Not really. He showed up to New Orleans already with pages and pages and pages of this character diary. I don’t know how many pages his final thing was but he definitely would come to set with it, all this self-exploration.McConaughey wasn’t initially offered the role of Rust, and you’ve said casting him called for some adjusting. How did you originally picture that character? There are so many different ways I’ve seen Cohle in my head and now it’s hard to separate what I read two years ago from now watching Matthew for all this time. I knew Rust was dark and intelligent and he had his vices and a caustic way of interacting with people, but his voice, the tempo of his speech, his physicality, I can’t remember at all. Even when Matthew said he wanted Rust, I kind of wrapped my head around it, but I wasn’t sure what it was gonna be until the first day of shooting. Until he walked and spoke and smoked I had no idea what he was gonna become.Rust’s philosophizing has made him this season’s star, but Marty’s an important counterpoint. And he has a great moment of painful self-awareness in the end himself. Can you talk about striking the balance between those two characters?It was important to see something like that from Marty. There’s much more to explore there in terms of how one heals a family that’s been so broken. There is some sort of detente there. When we were shooting the Hart story over the season, I always felt those interactions with the family were the most tangible examples of how behavior affects those around you. In many ways, it’s the heart of the story. Cohle is this lone wolf on the outside and he can philosophize but you don’t really see how he or his behavior affects other people. He’s purposely isolated. There were more scenes with Hart’s family that didn’t make it into the show, about his daughter and his relationship with Maggie. I always found that stuff the most interesting to shoot in terms of human drama.Were those scenes cut for time? As you know, there’s been some criticism of the show’s female characters as being underdeveloped. Do you think these scenes would have helped? Yeah, they weren’t cut because of story weight so much as time. My original cut of episode five was more than 90 minutes, so there’s a lot of material you lose. I still think it’s a very strong 60-minute episode, but you always miss the things you know about that add to the character that no one else will ever know about. Even if they add deleted scenes to a DVD it’s not the same as watching it in context from one moment to the next the way it was intended. I haven’t read the New Yorker piece people talk about. I mean, it’s true: the show wouldn’t pass the Bechdel test. That’s not necessarily a factor by which we should measure everything. It’s a story about two guys and that’s what it focuses on. It certainly does not focus on the women characters other than what it needs to to service the Hart story line.You won’t be directing next season. Any advice for person who takes the reins next season, assuming it will be just one person again? [Laughs.] “You can email me.” We didn’t finish until a couple weeks ago. I guess, “Start training now.” It’s a doozy.In Conversation: Quincy JonesAmerica Is Great, But Olympic Skater Adam Rippon Just Wants to Make Reese Witherspoon ProudBarack and Michelle Obama’s Official Portraits Are RevealedWhat’s New on Netflix: February 2018Every Episode of Black Mirror, Ranked From Worst to BestSee what’s new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBOHomeland Season-Premiere Recap: Welcome to the ResistanceThe Obamas’ Official Portraits Rise to the OccasionAdam Rippon Has Nothing to Say to Mike Pence, Which Is a Shame, Because Everything He Says Is GoldKim Cattrall Does Not Want ‘Hypocrite’ Sarah Jessica Parker’s Condolences at This TimeWhat Made Mirai Nagasu’s Triple Axel So IncredibleLike many internet trends, it was heavy on aesthetics and light on substance.Ruffin, the host of the Writers Guild of America East awards, slammed the Real Time comic.The Netflix series is being adapted from the graphic novel and comic by Gerard Way.Why rise to the No. 1 spot when you can just buy it?This show could be one of the all-time Star Trek greats.Zac Efron, please take a shower.A former neighbor had accused the singer of groping her at his home in 2016.They join stars Andrew Rannells and Don Cheadle.And it shows no signs of slowing down.Starting March 31.Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald join the canon.Whether for inspiration, fitspiration, or thirst.“You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV.”… some of these five come-from-behind conditions are met.Director Tom Tykwer on the dance clubs, flapper girls, and political violence in his new Netflix show.Parents have complained about a scene where Peter Rabbit uses a slingshot to force-feed a blackberry to a farmer who is allergic to the fruit.Is Reileen the true mastermind of Altered Carbon?Painted by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald.Everyone from Kristi Yamaguchi to Reese Witherspoon reacted. “Reese has been a wonderful support system in teaching me the ways of modernity,” Portman said.© 2018, New York Media LLC.

775	"HBOListen to our True Detective Spoiler Special, in which our critics debate the season finale:David Haglund: “Quite some time I’m gonna be thinking about you, Rust.” The corrupt sheriff Steve Geraci (Michael Harney) didn’t intend that line, one of my favorites from tonight’s finale, “Form and Void,” the way I do: He intends it as a threat. I think of it as my primary response to True Detective, and especially this episode. A lot of plot questions went more or less unanswered, which will bother some people, I’m sure. What was the nature of the conspiracy? Just how were the Tuttles involved? Who was the Yellow King?But the show answered the questions it needed to, both in terms of the storyline and, especially, with regard to its two central characters. In the end, this series really was more about them—particularly Rust—than it was about the wheels-within-wheels murder mystery that propelled the narrative. Quite some time I’m gonna be thinking about him. What are you thinking about?Willa Paskin: Oh man. I just finished watching about five minutes ago, which means I’ve had no real time to modulate my feelings, something I’m sure I’ll regret come the morning. But: I Really Did Not Like That. I think finales are under insane, constricting amounts of pressure in the Internet age, with thousands and thousands of people paying incredibly close attention to every single aspect of a show, hypothesizing en masse. If they do exactly what you were expecting, they’re screwed; if they do less than you were expecting, they’re screwed. It’s very hard to live up to expectations, let alone exceed them.But I am a little in awe of how totally snookered we all were. Boy, did we overthink this thing! The Internet’s theories about the case were so much more ingenious and captivating than what happened in tonight’s episode. They so much more neatly and plausibly tied up loose ends that the finale had no interest in. Maggie’s father-in-law, Audrey, even the Yellow King—not really relevant! Instead, we got a mansion out of Grey Gardens-meets-Deliverance deposited next to the largest catacomb this side of Europe. (Can you build that deep in the bayou? Or doesn’t the water come up? Or was the whole thing constructed just so Rust and Marty could stare up at a flat circle?) Also, it finally happened: Someone made Cary Grant super creepy.Worse was the last character beat. I think maybe True Detective ended with Rust Cohle finding God? Talk me off the ledge.Haglund: I’ll try. For starters, Rust did not find God, so far as I could tell: He found physics. (I haven’t watched the new Cosmos yet, but I hear its message is roughly the same.) Or maybe it’s more accurate to say he found hope. And I found his final speech, out by the hospital parking lot, genuinely moving.I didn’t love everything in the episode that preceded it. I did not find Errol William Childress an especially interesting monster. (You say Grey Gardens meets Deliverance, I say Norman Bates meets Hannibal Lecter.) But he did make sense thematically. That broken woman was apparently his sister, or half-sister, and she was evidently raped in her childhood by their grandfather. This was about the sins of the fathers being repeated by their sons. “You know what they did to me?” Childress asked. “What I would do to all the sons and daughters of man.”The theories concocted by the Internet were more elaborate and engaging purely in a puzzle-pieces sort of way, but Pizzolatto was apparently not kidding when he said his interests lay elsewhere. The show did quite a lot to nudge viewers down the rabbit hole, so I can understand some frustration. But I fell down there, too, and then came back up tonight, and was happy to do so.Paskin: Rust saying that he could feel a deeper darkness underneath him, one that was “warm, like a substance,” where his father and daughter were waiting for him, that was all love, that he wanted to just “let go” and join? That does not sound much like physics to me! Or, really, much like Rust Cohle from early on. Which is fine, Rust is allowed to change. But it did seem to me like the show was more than a little in love with Rust, and maybe not for the good.Here is a character—who, like you, I won’t be able to forget anytime soon—who was unique in part because of his particularly bleak way of thinking about his place in the universe. We’re all sentient meat, and all. Not only does he end the episode talking about how the light is winning, right before he sees Errol Childress he has, what, a revelation—or a hallucination that is almost indistinguishable from a revelation—of the opening of a hellmouth pointing right at Childress? This seems rather cheesy and mystical. And has there ever been a more over-the-top headbutt? I mean that thing was straight out of The Expendables! (As was his “cue the sniper” move on Steve.) Hiked up four feet on the edge of a knife and he headbutts his way to life. It’s enough to make me believe in a higher power—or maybe just a bunch of dudes sitting around a camera, being all, “You know what would be so, so cool??”Haglund: Rust learned his physics—we’re all star stuff, Willa—but that doesn’t mean Fukunaga did. (Or maybe Fukunaga just prefers to ignore physics when staging action sesquences.) And I’m honestly not bothered by the loose ends. It’s clear enough to me what happened: Evil has existed in the Tuttle family for a long time, and Errol is the latest and most grotesque embodiment of it. As for what Rust saw when he reached the pit of Carcosa, I took that as another hallucination of the sort he has had throughout the series, brought on in this case by the intensity of the situation. Pizzolatto was careful to set that up with an earlier exchange in the car, where Marty asked Rust if he still saw things sometimes. “Never stops, not really,” he said, having apparently lied to Papania and Gilbough about this. “What happened to my head, it’s not something that gets better.”And I don’t see Rust’s parking-lot epiphany as some spiritual deus ex machina. I see it, retrospectively, as what the whole series was building toward. His bleakness made him fascinating as a character, but we always knew it was rooted in pain—of the worst kind, the death of a child. He had, after that tragedy, shed all of his illusions—and all of humanity’s, as far as he was concerned. That’s the power of his revelation at the end: It’s not based on fairy tales, it’s based on his experience at the absolute pit of life. What he felt was love. And you can find that mawkish, if you like, and perhaps coming out of another actor’s mouth it would have seemed as much. But McConaughey made it moving, for me.Paskin: And I am not trying to take that from you! But I am trying to figure out why my first thought when the camera panned in on Rust sitting in his hospital bed, staring out the window at the city lights, in the midst of immense psychological distress, was, “Oh, he looks a lot like a guy in KISS.”One of the things I have so enjoyed about True Detective—which, let me be clear, is a show I still really love—is how all-enveloping it is. It’s a whole world, and you’re in it: the atmosphere, the green, even that ash and aluminum smell. But something about this episode just cracked that open for me, and all of pop culture came pouring in. The house Errol lived in looks so much like the mansion in The Notebook gone to seed. Having no cell phone reception is very every-horror-movie-ever. It’s like, the spell wore off and suddenly it was just a TV show.I think part of this is that the show did not just leave plot loose-ends, it left emotional ones as well (though perhaps not with regard to Rust). I wrote a piece a few weeks ago, about how True Detective semi-ignored its female characters on purpose. Now I think it was kind of just ignoring its female characters. All the stuff that was going on with Audrey, with Maggie—and there they are, at Marty’s bedside, as unfleshed out as ever. (And what was the deal with Maggie’s wedding rings?)I did love the moment where the woman whose house had been painted green remembered exactly how much it cost. There was something so perfect and human about that to me, the just-right detail that encapsulates so much of what True Detective did right. But the show really was, ultimately and intentionally, a bromance, albeit a really well-acted and well-written one. And there’s nothing wrong with that, but I did think that it was maybe something more, something in-addition-to. Not that I don’t hope Marty and Rust are giving each other the finger for eternity.Haglund: Here’s how I see it. When we—and by “we” here, I mean a significant percentage of the True Detective-watching Internet—saw those drawings that Audrey did, we figured that they were clues to something that would be revealed later. But really they were clues to what was going on with her in that moment. Was Audrey a victim of Childress? Probably not. But was she a victim of some other abuser? I’m guessing yes. Perhaps Maggie’s father. We don’t get the answers spelled out for us, but there’s enough to suggest that something like that happened. The sins of Childress may take an extreme form, but they are not unique. They do not come out of nowhere.I’m not going to say that Audrey or Maggie or Lisa or Beth were as well developed as characters as Rust and Marty were; this was, ultimately, the Rust-and-Marty show, and the rest of the series revolved around them. Nobody else on True Detective could spout a cliche like “Don’t ever change, man,” and have it feel perfect and hilarious. (Their hospital banter was a hoot.) For viewers who say that they’ve seen too many shows about dead beautiful women and the men who fail to save them, I can understand that response. But I think that this series, while not all-encompassing, was wonderfully what it was: a gripping, twisty, moody show about two men, and how one of them came through despair to the other side.Paskin: It’s true, we don’t know what happened to Audrey—and that’s the end of it. We just don’t know. I think I would be bothered a little less by this if I didn’t feel like the finale was in some ways very flabby. (It had something like five endings.) We really learned very little new information this episode—basically none, since we learned that something was definitely up with Childress at the end of last week. Instead, we got a long, dreamy sequence through this insanely detailed set, and moderate-to-no answers on many of the dangling questions. Which is an interesting and valid choice, obviously—a choice that seems even more willful given how loose this episode was.And while I’m not super into the idea that major characters have to die for a TV show to be serious, it’s pretty surprising that Marty and Rust both lived, no? An ax to the throat probably has a pretty high mortality rate. And the show tacked an additional happy ending on to their survival: The almost-final shot of the two of them leaning on each other through the parking lot was all the more sweet because you know in three days they’ll barely speak again.Haglund: The lowpoint of the finale, for me, was when Rust and Marty were looking at Marty’s laptop, going through ... tax records, I think it was? That did not strike me as the tightest bit of writing. So I can see, at least partly, where you’re coming from with regard to the flabbiness issue. And I did think, once they’d both gotten the business end of one of Errol’s blades—though I’m not sure either was hit in the throat, precisely—and were lying on the ground, that they had died, that this was how the series would end, with two detectives chasing a monster to their doom.That such an outcome actually felt like a live possibility is probably why the chase through the catacombs—and that fort is a real place in southern Louisiana, by the way—was riveting for me, purely as an action sequence. That shot of the top of McConaughey’s head, as he made his way through the tunnels? Fantastic work by Fukunaga and his cinematographer. I did wonder how, exactly, Errol’s voice traveled so well. And while I’m on his voice: The British accent was weird. I guess he learned one from all those VHS tapes he had stacked up around the TV.Paskin: Very American Hustle with the in-and-out British accent. (There’s another pop-culture reference that flitted through my brain.) And I wondered: Was Errol’s voice in Carcosa a hallucination? And how long had Errol’s daddy been tied up to that bed? Did he kill him right when he saw Marty and Rust roll up? But also: These are very small questions to be thinking about, compared to the bigger conspiracy.Still, if they didn’t get ‘em all, “We got ours,” as Marty said. And we, like Rust, will have to be content with the resolution that we did get. Or, at least, content until next season, when the dark and the light take up fighting again.Haglund: “I believe ‘no shit’ is the proper response to that observation.” I’m looking forward to the second installment.Paskin: L’chaim, fat ass.Read more of Slate's True Detective coverage.

	 / Entertainment / News celebrities / Did HBO Go Ruin Your Sunday Night? True Detective Finale Crashes The SiteHBO Go promised its subscribers that the season finale of the hugely popular True Detective would go up on the site at 9PM E.T., but the sheer number of users logging on caused the streaming site to crash for several hours. Fans of the show, desperate to find out if Marty and Rust would make it out of Carcosa alive, took to social media to unleash their anger over HBO Go's technical issues. Oh dear.Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.And with that brief tweet from HBO Go, fans of True Detective were sent spiraling into teary fits of rage and commiserated, I.E. launched abuse at the HBO Go service, with fellow watchers on Twitter.@madelman1 K. Trying to find a way to watch it illegally. Since the legal route is not an option.I now have time on my hands, and it is in the form of a flat circle. #HBOGO #TrueDetective pic.twitter.com/1cIqUy0tHbIt seemed like no matter how many times you refreshed or willed that spinning wheel to stop, the relatively new streaming site couldn't handle all the activity.As I sit on my 50th minute of trying to get #HBOGo to work, I start to question my priorities.I am so upset that I can't watch #TrueDetective that I am pacing my kitchen eating slices of cheese @hbogo #hbogoHours went by and the problem still remained, causing numerous fans to go bed without watching the suspenseful conclusion to the show. Unfortunately for them, they now have to spend the all of today avoiding spoilers - and we know how hard that's going to be since True Detective is all anyone (and the Internet) wants to talk about!All I want to do is go home and watch the #TrueDetective finale. It's really hard not reading any social media. #hbogo #hbo @HBOOur @TheAtlantic Roundtable weighs in on the #TrueDetectiveFinale. (With @OrrChris and @skornhaber) http://t.co/uKBqcQygxEThanks to ""HBO NO GO"" not working last night, I am dodging spoilers of True Detective like it's my job today! #hbogo #truedetectiveFor those lucky ones who did get to watch the finale, we finally glimpsed the bizarre life of serial killer, Errol Childress, a member of the sickening cult that was terrorizing Louisiana. He was basically a nightmare come to life. His sprawling estate was home to his mentally unstable half-sister-turned-lover, and he clearly had a thing for baby dolls and talking to his dead father who was tied up on a mattress in the shed.After confirming that Childress was the man they'd been looking for all season, they ambushed Childress' home and interrogated his half-sister-turned-lover. Rust chased after Childress and was lured into the center of Carcosa, a perverted underground maze built by the serial killer.Once he reached the end of the winding maze, Rust was momentarily distracted by a vision. ​Childress suddenly appeared from behind and stabbed Rust in the stomach. A fight ensued, giving Marty time to catch up to his partner and, hopefully, shoot Childress dead. Marty did get a few rounds off but it didn't stop Childress altogether. In a stunning move, he threw his tomahawk straight into Marty's chest. However, as he stood over Marty, ready to finish the deed, a bleeding Rust shot Childress in the back of the head.Okay, we won't give away everything. Just know that most of your lingering questions are answered in the heart-stopping finale that's earned a lot of praise from viewers!Wow. @McConaughey just gave, to my mind, the performance of his career in #TrueDetectiveFinale. Kudos to you man, that last scene was grace.Just finished #TrueDetective. Won't say anything of course, but what an achievement that was. Kind of makes every other show feel lame.#TrueDetectiveFinale was mind-blowing! Had it somewhat pieced together but even still #TrueDetective season 1 couldn't have ended betterDid you have #HBOGoProblems last night too? Vent away! Tweet us @sofeminineUK!414k20k30k2.2k

780	"The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Before the finale of the first season of True Detective aired on Sunday, creator Nic Pizzolatto granted an interview about the ending to critic Alan Sepinwall of the website HitFix.Among other things, he said: ""This is a story that began with its ending in mind, that [detective Rust] Cohle would be articulating, without sentimentality or illusion, an actual kind of optimism. That line, ['If ] you ask me, the light's winning,' that was one of the key pieces of dialogue that existed at the very beginning of the series' conception. For me as a storyteller, I want to follow the characters and the story through what they organically demand. And it would have been the easiest thing in the world to kill one or both of these guys.""He also said: ""Considering what these characters had been through, it seemed hard to me to work out a way where they both live and they both exit the show to live better lives beyond the boundaries of these eight episodes. Now they are going to go on and live forever beyond the margins of the show, and our sense, at least, is they haven't changed in any black-to-white way, but there is a sense that they have been delivered from the heart of darkness.""Story continues below advertisementYours truly was intrigued to read the ""heart of darkness"" reference, it being a continuing theme of my interpretation of the series. As it turned out, True Detective, if not a direct parallel to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, was in the end about encountering the darkest side of human nature, about stowing darkness in your heart – as Rust had done throughout in his cynicism – and transcending it.To some it was an oddly uplifting ending – the killer caught, the heroes injured but surviving, and the most hard-hearted of the duo softened in his final, drawled remark: ""Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning.""Yes, it was odd and disappointing: a conclusion so conventional that it seemed the previous abundant weight gave way to whimsy, an ending calculated to not disturb viewers who always saw the show as two cops on the trail of a killer who would be caught in the end, with the cops feeling good about it. The evaporation of Cohle's nihilism felt like a swindle in the story's end. The ending diminished Rust's cynicism to mere glumness and it seemed to suggest he was glad to be alive – even high on his almost-sunny new philosophy.Here's the key thing about True Detective – the journey was more compelling, complex and fascinating than the destination it arrived at. For all the vacancy in the final scene, the series had heft in its probing of darkness. It brooded on the perversity that exists beneath the surface of religious belief; it dwelt on corruption, not just among the powerful but among the powerless. It presented male rage in all its stark, selfish obstinance and offered insight into the sort of society that nourishes that rage.In his remarks about the finale, Pizzolatto didn't mention the ""post-industrial, end-of-empire thing"" in America that he articulated in January regarding the series's thematic substructure. But it was a relentless theme right to the end.The episode opened at the killer's almost-inaccessible, backwoods family home of people off the radar, gone rogue, distant from civilization both literally and figuratively: a place where, we were much reminded, there's no cellphone service.The warren of buildings and cave-like structures was overgrown with grass, a signal of decay and of a post-wealth, post-industrial situation. It all looked like the remnants of some ancient society now forgotten, near-buried by nature.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementAnd what the crime came down to, in the end, was the work of people existing in the squalor of decay and in caves, limited to finding significance in structures made of sticks and in putting daubs on a wall: profoundly primitive, near-Stone-Age people in their limited sophistication.We saw a landscape gorgeously rendered but desolate, some of it ravaged by hurricanes and floods, some of it destroyed by the end of old industries. It's that set of images and leitmotifs that we can take away from the eight hours of True Detective.The creator of the series may well have planned the concluding flash of optimism from the beginning. But he ensured that getting to that point was an unforgettable encounter with pessimism and the negative, with sour themes and a grim view of a society receding to primitivism.In that context, the ending remains disappointing, with its uplifting touch. And yet, from the journey to that point, we know how flimsy the optimism is.Follow me on Twitter: @MisterJohnDoyle Latest Videos © Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail Inc.

783	"HBO‘s True Detective finale bagged a series high of 3.5 million viewers Sunday at 9 PM — a 50% spike from the crime anthology’s premiere of 2.3 million. With an average gross audience of 11 million viewers season to date, True Detective becomes HBO’s most-watched freshman series since Six Feet Under’s 11.4 million viewers in 2001. Across the night’s three telecasts, the series also hit a high — 4.9 million viewers. Last night, demand for tonight’s season finale of  True Detective was so great online, the network’s streaming service HBO GO temporarily crashed, which may have helped drive viewers to the TV viewing.  The disruption played into True Detective‘s pop culture phenom image over its eight episodes. Two weeks earlier, an average of 2.6 million viewers watched the drama anthology at 9 PM, besting the premiere’s previous high of 2.3 million on January 12. It drew a then-series-best 3.6 million viewers across its three plays. While the first season of True Detective was conceived as a closed-ended arc with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, creator Nic Pizzolatto is already working on a premise for a second season with new characters and a new storyline in a new locale.

True Detective ended its first season with a line I don't think I ever will forget.Aside from that line, the first-season finale of True Detective, which aired Sunday night on HBO Canada, kind of turned into American Horror Story.Not that anything supernatural occurred. But atmospherically, things sure got spooky.Obviously if you haven't watched the episode yet and are intending to do so, consider this a SPOILER ALERT. If you have seen it, I wonder if you'll agree with me that there were a few subtle surprises on the one hand, but no big surprises on the other.Okay, first of all, the biggest pleasing subtle surprise for me came with the final line, when Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) displayed some optimism.Fittingly if neither of them were going to die, the season ended with Rust and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) continuing their love-hate relationship by engaging in another one of their deep conversations. This one occurred outside Lafayette General Hospital.Trying to cheer up the seriously injured but apparently on-the-mend Rust, Marty brought up the subject of how Rust used to gaze at the stars and make up stories when he was a boy in Alaska. But Rust replied he had come to believe there's only one story, the oldest: “Light versus dark.”Marty, glancing at the Louisiana night sky, made the cynically comical observation, “I know we ain't in Alaska, but it appears to me the dark has a lot more territory.”But then just a little bit later, Rust circled back. Rust ended the season by saying to Marty, “You know, you're looking at it wrong, that sky thing. Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning.”That is a great line.I had to rewind three or four times to make it out, because Rust mumbled the words. But they're in my brain for good now. I just know it.A side comment I'll make about that final scene: Was that not the quietest hospital you've ever witnessed? No activity just outside it, no ambulances, not even any sirens in the distance. Yes, it was night, but most hospitals are hubs of activity 24 hours a day. Not a criticism, just an observation. Hey, it's TV, I get it.As for the lead-up to that final scene, there really were no big surprises in the True Detective finale, as far as bizarre plot twists or sharp turns out of nowhere. That actually was kind of refreshing.The most dramatic scene of the whole season, of course, was the final scene of the second-last episode, when the camera moved through the early-evening sunshine to reveal the scars on the face of the creepy dude who had been on the riding mower. As we now know, that was serial killer Errol William Childress.The strange, isolated place where Childress was living, which we got to see throughout the final episode, was where the afore-mentioned memories of American Horror Story came into it for me. Honestly, that abode would have fit snugly into any of the three seasons of American Horror Story that have aired so far.True Detective's violent climax with Rust, Marty and Childress wasn't particularly inventive. It was sort of standard stuff, to be honest. But I really liked the denouement. It was poetic and artistic.So nothing crazy happened, but everything crazy happened.Obviously you can just hand the Emmy to McConaughey. And with all due respect to his signature slogan, “All right, all right, all right,” I think his character's last line in the first season of True Detective will stick with me far longer.Bill.harris@sunmedia.ca@billharris_tv If you already have an account on this newspaper, you can login to the newspaper to add your comments.

The serial killer’s lair, dubbed “Carcosa,” makes The Blair Witch Project’s witch house look like a page in a Pottery Barn catalog.In the short stories that inspired True Detective, Carcosa is a cursed city in an alien world. Until the finale, Carcosa is a mysterious part of the show’s elaborate mythology, a place mentioned reverently by various doomed and deranged characters. In the finale, Carcosa is finally revealed: an overgrown chamber of horrors used for all sorts of violent devil worship.To build Carcosa, New Orleans-based artist Joshua Walsh created a satanic altar from human skulls, antlers, oyster shells, burnt driftwood, and, for an extra sinister touch, cutesy children’s toys. He rubbed the skulls with yellow turmeric and carved them with what’s essentially the killer’s logo–an angular spiral that will forever haunt our dreams. What Walsh calls “spirit bundles” hang from the altar like evil cocoons. “To distort the figure with a beast quality, I incorporated the spine of a cow,” Walsh writes on HBO Go’s site. He also noted that the oyster shells mixed with turmeric helped create a “spicy death smell.”The serial killer at the heart of the show is a particularly artistic one–he leaves visual clues like eerie twig sculptures called “Devil’s Nests” and chilling graffiti on the walls of his decrepit haunts. Instead of using an in-house production team to create the show’s art, as is standard in Hollywood, the producers decided to cast an individual artist as the unseen killer’s hand in order to make the aesthetic consistent and authentic. They’d asked several artists to provide samples of their vision of the killer’s work, but none fit the bill.It wasn’t until the producers noticed a sculpture of a hummingbird made from sinew and twigs on the desk of set decorator Cynthia Slagter, a gift from her friend Walsh, that they pinpointed him for the job. Walsh, an avid hunter and taxidermist and the son of a family who ran a funeral home, had to channel a killer’s mindset and imagine what sort of artistic slug trail he would leave in his wake. He worked full-time for nine months to create a collection of about 100 murals, paintings, and sculptures. It will take weeks of watching nothing but cute cat videos to get Carcosa out of our heads.Carey Dunne is a Brooklyn-based writer covering art and design. Follow her on Twitter.

786	"So the True Detective finale last night was so popular it actually crashed the HBO GO system—but the service is now back to normal. So if you haven't watch it yet, GET ON IT, because we have a lot to talk about! In my opinion, in the end, True Detective was just an excellent ""buddy cop"" show (here's a list of the show's 31 cliches) with some fantastic acting and some great directing by Cary Fukunaga. But that doesn't mean I wasn't riveted, or didn't love it to death! Expect a lot of Emmys for everybody who worked on True Detective this coming year. Now, Hitfix has a great and illuminating interview with True Detective creator Nic Pizzolato, in which he discusses the overarching theme, why the show ended the way it did, the often-maligned female characters, and why viewers should be careful to label Rusty Cohle's philosophy as ""hogwash"":I don't want to restrict an audience by telling them that ""this means this"" and ""this means this."" My intentions are the inalterable definition of things. For people who thought Cohle's philosophy was simply hogwash, be aware that you're calling Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche hogwash. Just be aware of that. That is not, in fact, a college freshman stoned eating a pizza talking about life; that's Arthur Schopenhauer's thoughts on life. But I thought that was part of the tension within Cohle.Nic also gave the faintest tease for the next season of True Detective:Okay. This is really early, but I'll tell you (it's about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.Okay! I AM THERE! But before we go, let's see what you thought of the whole shebang:

787	"Fans of HBO's True Detective are an obsessive lot. Over the course of the show's 8-episode first season, bajillions of hours of productivity were wasted discussing, dissecting, and speculating about the show. Insane-sounding theories about the identity of the murderous Yellow King abounded, each with an insane-sounding premise that actually made sense if you just listen, guys, no seriously hear me out. The Louis XIV theory, the Lawn Mower theory, the Lovecraft theory, the Boat theory, The Maggie theory. The hidden crowns and spirals theory. But I've got one to beat them all. One that extends further than the show. The Every Movie Matthew McConaughey Has Ever Made Has Actually Been About Rust Cohle Theory. If you look for signs everywhere, you'll find them. Laugh it up. Laugh it up all you want, Sir Chucklepants. But I've got compelling evidence from a small amount knowledge of Matthew McConaughey's catalog combined with a buzzy, paranoid mind suffering from the aftereffects of too much True Detective that leads me to believe that all these years, it was, in fact Rust Cohle starring in all these shitty movies. He was just undercover. So join me. Follow my flat circle of insanity around and around in progressively smaller circles, like a lawn mower in a cemetery, until my True Detective superfandom collapses upon itself and forms an absurd singularity. In this film, which in the life of Rust Cohle predates and of his True Detecting, a young holy man named Palmer Joss gets into philosophical arguments with Astronaut Jodie Foster about the nature of belief. This is where Rust learned to be pedantic. He changed his name from Palmer Joss to a much more detectivey name: Rust Cohle. AdvertisementWhen this film was released, audiences received it as a breezy romcom — and why wouldn't they? —but time has revealed that the film is anything but breezy. This is the story of Rust Cohle's tragic courtship with his wife, played by Kate Hudson. On the movie's publicity materials and in the movie's most iconic scene, Hudson wears a yellow dress. A call-forward to The YELLOW King, obviously. SEE?!AdvertisementLook out how they're standing — the angle between their bodies conjures images of the creepy ""devil nets"" that have appeared at all sorts of crime scenes in True Detective. The two seem to have trapped light between them, in much the same way the devil is believed to be trapped in the rudimentary stick figures that are so ubiquitous in the show. I HAVEN'T BATHED IN DAYS. Use of the color yellow is almost suffocating in this Rust Cohle film, which is a misguided comedic take on his failed marriage to Kate Hudson, who also is living one continuous life from one film to another. AdvertisementAn undercover Rust Cohle, pretending to be a dippy, preening California Angels player named Ben Williams, investigates drug use in professional baseball, only to believe that he is being propelled forward by magical angels that are giving him unexplained powers. AdvertisementIn later years, Rust will understand that it was the PCP.[Yes, I know this movie came out before Contact and Fools Gold and How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. But, man, time is a flat circle. A flat, rotating circle on my HBOGo screen that reads LOADING.]AdvertisementUpstart narcotics agent Rust Cohle is promoted and now investigates drug use among male sex workers under the lazy alias ""Dallas,"" picked for the city from which his sting operation is based. AdvertisementNote the color of Rust/Matthew's shirt during this scene, when ""Dallas"" is teaching a young colleague to dance all sexy and stuff. Also note the cross tattoo on Alex Pettyfer's chest, which could mean something to do with Reverend Tuttle or the abandoned church or SOMETHING TO DO WITH SATAN, GUYS. EVERYTHING MEANS SOMETHING.  On True Detective, we learn that Rust Cohle spent a fair amount of time in Texas, working narcotics. The film Dazed and Confused is about teens in Texas who do drugs on the last day of school. Checks out.Advertisement""David Wooderson,"" in addition to sounding like a name someone made up in a moment of weed-induced paranoia, is notably older than the teen characters in the film, once remarking that high school girls ""stay the same age"" even though he gets older. Possible ominous foreshadowing of the stasis of age in the face of death, like the murder victims in True Detective? But this should give you shivers: Here's Wooderson in his iconic scene. Note he is standing in front of a yellow portion of sign that contains a flat circle, and his shirt features a Jesus-like face, not dissimilar to the face of the crucifix Rust Cohle hangs in his sparse 1995 apartment. Truly chilling.AdvertisementNot only is Wooderson dropping clues left and right that he is actually Rust Cohle, he can't stop himself from dropping philosophical bon mots even though he's deep undercover. Sweet, unblemished baby Rust. Things are going to take a dark turn.More drug investigating in Texas. The whole AIDS thing was an elaborate Cohle-ian ruse.AdvertisementFurther, McConaughey plays a bull rider. Bulls have horns. Horns like Dora Lange. A low-level Texas drug dealer named Chris hires a hit man named Joe (who is a cop, LIKE RUST COHLE) to murder his mother so that he can collect on her insurance. Joe is a cop who moonlights as a hit man, which is totally something I could see Rust Cohle doing. He's seen stuff. Scary stuff. AdvertisementTwo kids discover an eccentric guy named Mud living in a treed boat. Mud reportedly killed a guy in Texas (TEXAS IS WHERE RUST COHLE WAS!). It all fits. ""Love and waves, that's what we need in these dark days,"" say promotional materials for Surfer, Dude, a film about a surfer having an existential crisis about selling out. AdvertisementThis film explains how Rust Cohle and Marty Hart met — beneath a canopy of yellow, their golden crowns of yellow hair wreathing their tanned faces.

Warning: Massive spoilers ahead if you haven't watched the ""True Detective"" finale.
The highly-anticipated season finale to ""True Detective"" aired last night.For seven episodes, we've followed Marty (Woody Harrelson) and Rust (Matthew McConaughey) as they re-opened a case about missing women and children they thought they solved 17 years ago.
    For 15 minutes we followed the two detectives as they chased and confronted
    the real killer
    , Errol Childress, in what was one of the most nauseating and heart-pounding sequences we've watched on live TV in awhile.
  We made a few GIFs of the best moments from the strenuous scenes.Again, if you haven't watched the finale, head back. There are a bunch of spoilers ahead.Rust (Matthew McConaughey) spots Errol (Glenn Fleshler) and tells him not to move.


    Obviously, that doesn't go well.
    



    ... ending at a creepy altar made with skulls, a cow's spine, oyster shells, and kid's charms.
    

    Rust had a pretty deep, dark existential moment in the tunnels, and we wondered whether or not we were watching
    Fox's ""Cosmos"" premiere
    .
    

    This resulted in him getting knifed.
    


    You can rattle McConaughey, but you can't take the man down without a fight.
    



    Marty comes to save the day ... or not.
    

And just like that ... it's over.

The action culminated in the two ending up at the altar, leaving everyone to wonder Rust's fate.

What did you think of the finale? Were you satisfied with the way creator Nic Pizzolatto ended the first season?"	Entertainment
792	"It's over. HBO's massive watercooler drama ""True Detective"" was a multi-layered wonder not seen since their other must-watch series ""The Wire."" As an anthology, we know by now that Rust Cohle and Marty Hart won't be back (although we'd die to see a series about their detective agency. Right??). And sure, the charisma between Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson was an effortless asset to the show, the entire audience is probably playing armchair casting director today and we're no different.     While he was sketchy on details, series creator Nic Pizzolatto told Hitfix that season 2 was about ""hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system. More occult? Oy...We're also wondering if the show, which crashed its popular HBO GO app Sunday night, will keep its parallel narrative structure. If so, there's a multitude of scenarios Pizzolatto can draw from. That said, we figured it would be fun to whip up a short list of possible contenders as well as locales for next year. Jon Hamm and Damian Lewis
The heat and horror of Hells Kitchen in '77 is the primary backdrop where our cops are dumped a case investigating an unsolved gang murder of a Westie which leads us to present day Madison Avenue. In the era of post 911 fear and trauma, red tape may be the biggest adversary to our gumshoes, especially when one of them can't play nice with big city brass. John Cusack & Alexander Skarsgård 
What looks like a routine murder of a showgirl in Las Vegas in 1982, goes way deeper. As gangsters move on to greener pastures and corporate entities take over the hotels, there's a new threat that looms in the desert. When one of our heroes has hidden mob ties, everyone is a suspect in this Sin City tale.   
Ed Norton/Robert Downey Robert Downey Jr. & Edward Norton
Someone is killing Hollywood A-listers and two veteran cops are thrown a lead by a studio mogul who may or may not be involved. From the backroom editing bays of the early '90s to modern studio backlots, our heroes try to weed out who's telling the truth in a town filled with professional liars.   Jessica Chastain & Michelle Williams
By now, everyone knows that meth is sweeping our nation. Walter White and ""Breaking Bad"" made sure of that. Our story here, though, kicks off in Portland, Oregon where two cops work the same case in different parts of the city. When they eventually pool their resources, they're shocked to find not only where their investigation leads, but who is behind it.Hilary Swank & Elisabeth Moss
As the Golden State ramped up for one of the biggest tech booms in history, two police officers in 1999 unveil a real estate scandal in the heart of San Francisco that leads them all the way to Silicon Valley. The more they dig, the uglier it gets, especially when an emerging tech giant makes sure none of their questions are answered. Flash forward almost 15 years and the company is bigger than ever but that doesn't mean our two heroes didn't forget and when a new clue shows up, their case is reopened.     Question: Do you have a dream cast for next season? Let us know your scenario.

793	"DNAinfo has closed.Click here to read a message from our Founder and CEOGothamist is a website about New York  After weeks of frenzied speculation and argument and, let's face it, temporary insanity, True Detective's debut season finally climaxed last night (for some of us, anyway). Did episode 8, ""Form and Void,"" tie up all the loose ends spun out by writer Nic Pizzolatto's intricate script? Nope. But the finale brought resolution on its own terms, and was satisfying despite (or maybe even because of?) the plot questions it left unanswered. No, Maggie wasn't involved in the horrifying kidnap pedophilia cult. Neither was her father, which some True Detective theorists were absolutely convinced of. Further, all of Audrey's childhood sexual turmoil apparently had nothing to do with the case, except insofar as her father Marty was a largely absent human tampon. The Five Horsemen theory remains a theory, and the sprawling depth of the conspiracy remains unplumbed. And the painting above Marty and Maggie's bed that matched the mural in the hospital was not as significant as we thought. It wasn't significant at all, in fact. Heh, we kind of lost it back there for a bit, didn't we?It was a fun way to get lost, though, albeit highly disturbing. I don't think I'll be rewatching episode 8 any time soon—that whole opening sequence with Errol Childress's dead ""daddy"" chained to a bedframe followed by him fingerbanging his sister on his lap as she recalls the first time their grandfather raped her... yeah, I'm all set on that. I did however savor seeing ""that cocksucker"" rummy Steve Geraci eat dirt in a barrage of sniper bullets. (""L'chaim fat ass!"") And how about that gorgeous exterior shot of that overgrown Civil War-era fort that Childress turned into Carcosa? I've also got no complaints about the harrowing final confrontation between Childress and the detectives, which delivered a terrifying chase through dark tunnels.And Cohle's last hallucination as he gazes up at a circular opening in the ceiling was breathtaking.  Pizzolatto has said in interviews that he's only interested in the serial killer aspect of True Detective in so far as it illuminates the relationship between Rust and Marty and their flaws, and Form and Void was certainly proof of that. As they pursue their Spaghetti Monster, their begrudging friendship is reestablished, coming full circle and then some with more of their classic carpool banter. (Don't these guys ever want to listen to some Creedence or something?) But it's the ending's ending that really delivers, and that I will rewatch. Matthew McConaughey's emotional breakdown outside the hospital is incredibly powerful stuff, and watching him talk about love with such vulnerability after eight episodes of stoic pessimism is astonishing. Rust has touched the darkness, the darkness touched back, and he reemerged transformed. He claims he shouldn't be there, but there he is, staggering away from the hospital with the help of his partner, and now he's the one sounding optimistic. When Marty remarks that the sky's darkness seems to be overwhelming the stars, Rust says, ""You're looking at it wrong, the sky thing. Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning."" Light: kicking ass for 14 billion years and counting. It is one hell of a story.So Marty and Rust hobble off into the sunset together in life-affirming defiance of all our darkest expectations. The monster at the end of their story was not a particularly compelling one in the annals of fictional serial killers, but it was their journey to him—and the intelligent yet passionate way their journey's story was told—that made the show so engrossing. Cary Fukunaga's masterfully sumptuous direction gave Harrelson and McConaughey all the room they needed to untangle Pizzolatto's dense narrative, with a pair of raw, pitch-perfect performances that will no doubt be seen as career peaks. Pizzolatto's career is just getting started, and while last night marked the end of Marty and Rust's story, we can now start the countdown for True Detective's second season, which Pizzolatto says will concern ""hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system."""

Hannibal (NBC)Based on the Thomas Harris characters from his Red Dragon book series, Hannibal explores a modern take on the infamous cannibal serial killer and psychiatrist before his imprisonment. Were you a fan of Rust Cohle's cryptic and poetic lines in True Detective? Well, Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of Dr. Lecter and the way he describes the human mind (and his food) is definitely a similar tone to Cohle's despairing rants.Though its on one of the biggest networks, this series from Bryan Fuller (Pushing Daisies, Dead Like Me) gets away with a lot of gruesome imagery. If you're a fan of True Detective's dark murders and graphic violence, this is the show for you.Currently in its second season, you can watch Hannibal on Amazon Prime and on NBC.The Americans (FX)Fans of this amazing Cold War espionage drama might disagree with having The Americans on this list, but the tension on this show is easily comparable to True Detective.Following two Russian spies posing as a married couple during the 1980s in America, viewers find themselves on the edge of their seats each week as a new mission builds into success or consequential failure. There's just too much at stake for us not to ache for a happy ending, much like some scenes in True Detective.Currently in its second season, you can watch The Americans on FX and online on Amazon Prime.Justified (FX)Though this has much more laughs than True Detective, FX's Justified shares the Southern crime drama recipe but with less devil worshipping but just as many freaks.It's hard not to fall in love with Deputy Marshall Rayland Givens, whose quick wit is almost matched by his speed in drawing on a bad guy. Mix that with the criminal Boyd Crowder, whose charm makes viewers forget all of the bad he's done, and you've got an incredible detective series.Currently in its fifth season, you can catch up on past Justified episodes on Netflix.Top of the Lake (Sundance)We all know that True Detective is pretty cringe-worthy at times considering how the victims of the series are raped and killed, but the subject matter in Top of the Lake might beat the HBO series in the category.Set in New Zealand, a strong-willed female detective (Elisabeth Moss) is investigating a case of a missing 12-year-old girl in her hometown. Upon finding the girl, she is discovered to be pregnant. This opens up a whole can of worms that involves the little girl's father, the detective's past, and a community of women that have set up a small village in town.This one-off mini-series aired last year, but every minute is available on Netflix.The Following (Fox)True Detective is garnering high praise, but we have to admit that it can be a bit crazy at times. For fans of the wild nature of the series, you should look into Fox's highly popular show, The Following.Based on a cult that follows a serial killer obsessed with Edgar Allan Poe, The Following is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride full of twists and violence.Currently in its second season, you can catch up on The Following on Hulu Plus.Do you like our list?

797	"(Spoilers ahead!) Was there any way for last night's True Detective finale not to be disappointing on some level? For those of us who have been caught up in this series, obsessively poring over every episode and endlessly theorizing about what every single nanosecond of screen time meant, I'm not sure creator Nic Pizzolatto could have delivered anything that wouldn't have been a tiny bit of a letdown.Plus, unlike other season finales, we knew this was the end of this particular story. This show has resonated with viewers in such a big way, it was going to be hard to bid farewell however it resolved itself. Personally, I enjoyed this last episode -- but it definitely wasn't quite what I expected. Here were the 5 final True Detective moments that surprised me the most:The killer was … the lawnmower guy. The End.If you were hoping every dangling plot thread and hinted-at visual clue would be addressed in a mind-bending unravel that would shock us to our very core, well, this wasn't that episode. Nor did it delve into the supernatural territory some had predicted, despite a teasing moment when Rust hallucinated a great swirling vortex while hunting through those nightmarish catacombs.Instead, we reinforced what we'd already suspected: the murderer was Errol Childress, a monstrous but non-mystical man who had been kidnapping, raping, and killing children in ritualistic ways for years. Other reprehensible men had been involved, but as far as revealing a groundwater-deep Yellow King conspiracy involving the Tuttles, various clergy-members, and surprise figures from the Louisiana upper class (such as, for instance, Marty's father-in-law), the show didn't go there.Pizzolatto told Hitfix why he ended it the way he did:What was more interesting to me is that both these men are left in a place of deliverance, a place where even Cohle might be able to acknowledge the possibility of grace in the world. (…) I think it would have rang false to have Hart and Cohle suddenly clean up 50 years of the culture history that led to Errol Childress, or to get all the men in that video. It's important to me, I think, that Cohle says, ""We didn't get em all, Marty,"" and Marty says, ""We ain't going to. This isn't that kind of world.""The investigative path that led them to Errol was a SERIOUS leap.I realize this is nitpicky, especially since I pretty much gave the show a massive pass on the way things were resolved in favor of enjoying the character study that I deemed far more important than specific narrative details, but come on, Marty tying the painted green house to the green-eared spaghetti monster? I have to echo Rust's marveling ""Fuck you, man"" on that one. Even the rabid conspiracy nuts on the Internet had a better theory about Errol. What makes more sense, a pair of green noise-reducing earmuffs, or a worker who managed to slop housepaint all over his EARS?Also, that was a mighty sharp memory on the elderly lady in the nursing home. I had the interior of our house painted 18 months ago and I couldn't tell you who did it or how much it cost.Marty’s daughter Audrey was a red herring.If there was one gaping hole that was left completely unaddressed last night, it was Audrey and the sexual abuse we all assumed she'd endured as a child. Here's how Erin Moriarty, who played Marty's daughter, explained the unanswered questions about her character:The investigation becomes Marty and Rust’s life, and somehow, when Audrey is younger, she must have gained access to something involving the case. You don’t know about that kind of thing unless you’ve been exposed to it, which most young kids haven’t at that age, and she and her younger sister have been forced to grow up very quickly due to the circumstances at home, so I think it’s clear that somehow she’s become aware of—or gained access to—the circumstances of her father’s investigation. So she’s exposed to something like that when she’s far too young, and is seeking attention from her parents and draws those inappropriate drawings.Woody Harrelson made us cry.Well, maybe you didn't find yourself unexpectedly choking up during his hospital bed scene, but I sure did. When he was surrounded by Maggie and his daughters -- surrounded by all that he'd lost (note the lingering shot of Maggie's new wedding ring) -- and he spluttered, ""Fine, I'm fine. I'll be fine,"" before breaking down completely … I mean, damn. McConaughey's been incredibly well-deserving of the many accolades he's received for his performance on this show, but Harrelson's been knocking it out of the park in his own way. You get an Emmy. And you get an Emmy! Everyone gets an Emmy!The most important line of the entire series was almost impossible to hear.""Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light’s winning."" Tell me I'm not the only one who had to rewind to make sense of McConaughey's drawl-which-occasionally-lapses-into-straight-up-mumbling. When a line is that critical, I feel like the script shouldn't have read ""Once there was only [INAUDIBLE],"" you know?After a million theories, the big shocking twist in True Detective was that after all the nihilism and darkness, we were left with a sense of hope. And maybe, just maybe, a slight readjustment of our overly-active imaginations for next season. As Pizzolatto put it,To me, if there's one governing thing in ""True Detective"" that encompasses everything that is happening in ""True Detective,"" and that the show is telling you — constantly, the show keeps telling you — is that everything is a story. (…) The show was never concerned with the supernatural, but it was concerned with supernatural thought, and it was concerned with supernatural thinking to the degree that it was concerned with storytelling. So if there was one overarching theme to ""True Detective,"" I would say it was that as human beings, we are nothing but the stories we live and die by — so you'd better be careful what stories you tell yourself.I have to say, this rather nicely echoes Marty's line from one of the early episodes:You got a chapter in one of those books on jumping to conclusions? You attach an assumption to a piece of evidence, you start to bend the narrative to support it and prejudice yourself.Yeah, I think many of us ended up building this show into something it was never quite meant to be (down to off-base assumptions triggered by the gloriously complex set design: ""I didn’t even notice that one. None of us put it together that there was a spiral in there""), but in the end, I don't really care. I absolutely loved watching it, from beginning to end, and I can't wait to see what Pizzolatto brings to the table next season.What did you think about the True Detective finale?Image via HBO

799	Spoilers for the season finale of True Detective follow:“There were other times I thought I was mainlining the secret truth to the universe.” —Rust Cohle, episode 2“Once there was only dark. If you ask me, light’s winning.” —Rust Cohle, episode 8As I’ve never been good at predicting the endings to mysteries, there are plenty of directions that the True Detective finale might have gone in that would not have surprised me a bit. A dark secret rising out of Rust or Marty’s past? Sure. Ancient gods, aliens, a surprise crossover with True Blood? All right. Sentient meat? Why not?The one thing that I would not have predicted, though, was that this dark, brooding series, this recruitment video for nihilistic pessimism, this express elevator to the sub-sub-subbasement of human degradation would end up… Hopeful? Optimistic? Even spiritual?Better scenario-spinners than I have spent the last few weeks concocting elaborate resolutions to True Detective‘s mystery, positing one or another character—or supernatural force—as the Big Bad. There was no such whammo twist: the investigation took us right where it suggested it was leading, even if it took us through a creepy backwoods haunted house / cloister to get there. Errol Childress, ol’ Scarface, was indeed the killer—or at least, a killer, the one Marty and Rust would have to content themselves with nailing. Why? Ritual abuse, occult worship, pretty much exactly what it looked like.There was a twist ending, though, and it had nothing to do with the plot but rather the psyche, or dare I say the soul, of bleak-hearted Rust Cohle. As he lay comatose in the hospital, his long-lost daughter returned, not as a final piece to the puzzle or shocking link to the Yellow King investigation, but as a lost child haunting her aching father. Rust started to go into that good night and, being Rust, found more darkness, except this darkness was good—”deeper. Warm. Like a substance”—and it held everyone he’d ever loved. It was darkness, but it wasn’t nothing; it was the point.I don’t think this was necessarily about atheist Rust literally finding heaven. It might have been, or it could have been one of the hallucinations he was prone to; it could have been the sort of hallucination we’re all prone to, facing the end. If he didn’t get religion, he got where religion comes from. Then, having found whatever kind of peace he did, he was pulled back into the world, and in one last tour de force performance, Matthew McConaughey’s shattered face conveys his devastation at losing his daughter one more time.And—and here’s the ending I never saw coming: he goes on. He sees meaning. There’s a story here, one story—the oldest—about the fight between light and dark. He and Marty were given their one bit of the dark to extinguish but, just as with the men in the masks, they’ll never get it all. But, he says, “Once there was only dark. If you ask me, light’s winning.”It’s a remarkably generous take on the power of story and metaphor to give hope to a bleak existence, especially for a series that often seemed to be 100% simpatico with Rust’s bleak view of spirituality and religion. (I keep flashing back to the moment in the premiere in which the minister played by Clarke Peters calls the devil-nets a myth for children–“tell them stories while they’re tying sticks together”—as the camera closes in on a cross on the wall. Get it?) It’s a secular argument for finding wonder in the vastness of the universe. And it was, in a way I never expected from this series, beautiful and moving.Was it satisfying, though? I’m, guessing that a sector of viewers looked at Marty and Rust’s male-bonding heart-to-heart and saw a repeat of what they hated about the Lost and Battlestar Galactica finales: all this buildup, and it’s one more freaking show telling you that all you need is love.And if you judge the series as a mystery—which it was, Nic Pizzolatto’s protestations notwithstanding—the plot payoff was meager. The hunt for Erroll was a lot of spooky buildup to a very conventional fight to the death–right down to Rust shooting him from behind moments before he could deliver an axe blow to Marty. What we learned of the killer himself wasn’t really a revelation of his psychology or the beliefs of his cult so much as a collection of weirdnesses—the hoarding, the incest, Daddy strapped on a slab, the affected British accent[!]—that seemed heaped on to create a sense of gothic creep-o-rama. Gilbaugh and Papania were just cops investigating a case, not muscle for the Yellow King—and the Yellow King him/itself was no particular figure, just another of the eternal darkness’ long list of aliases. As for the mythology driving the killing—the disc and the loop, the infernal plane–it ends up nothing more than the crazy talk it sounded like.And look, those flaws in the finale reflected flaws in the show overall, even as it’s ridden a wave of overexcited hype canonizing it as the greatest thing since The Wire, or maybe since the electrical wire. True Detective was an artfully written, remarkably acted, stunningly visualized portrait of Marty and Rust trying to find the path in an overgrown world of decay. (From Carcosa to the last montage of Louisiana landscapes, Cary Fukunaga made the setting look dead and teeming with life at the same time.) But everyone else around them was a Yellow King, a story device drawn with the minimum amount of pen strokes–the women, the other cops, the bayou big shots, the good ole boys and the bad ole boys. They threw off only enough light to illuminate the two stars.That limitation kept the season from top-tier, all-time-TV-pantheon greatness, but the show had pockets of greatness that were stunning. True Detective was the closest thing American TV has done in a while to the British model of drama, a story told in one season, from the keyboard of a single writer (and the lens of one director). There was nobody to dilute the creator’s perspective, or to call b.s. on it. A more collaborative show, in the typical American model, might have fixed many of its problems. A writer’s room or a strong collaborator might have gotten Pizzolatto to make his supporting characters more three-dimensional, an accomplished crime writer—as, say, David Simon brought on The Wire with the likes of Richard Price and George Pelecanos—might have juiced the mystery plot, or excised some of the red-herring flourishes that probably left clue-hunters feeling cheated.It might have been better; we’ll never know. That show would have been more consistent, less pretentious, probably more satisfying in its ending. But I’m guessing it would also have been less sui generis, less dedicated in its unusual goal of finding meaning in an endless, Godless universe. It might have been neater and less full of its own philosophy, and it might have covered all its bases, but to paraphrase Marty, that wasn’t the world we were living in. Like Marty and Rust solving part, but only part, of the mystery, True Detective did what it did and didn’t what it didn’t, but as a whole? The light outshone the dark.Now for a quick, last hail of bullets:* “L’chaim, fat-ass!” One of the most interesting contrasts to another recent big drama finale—Breaking Bad‘s—is that Rust ended up pulling off a literal version of the gambit Walter White ingeniously faked, hiring a trained sniper to make sure someone didn’t cross him later.* Another weird TV synchronicity here: the finale, with its theme of a secularist finding meaning in the vastness of the universe, came along on the same night the first episode of Cosmos did the same thing in documentary form.* For some background on the finale—including an explanation for Erroll’s wide repertoire of voices—see Alan Sepinwall’s post-mortem interview with Pizzolatto. (Speaking of the voices, it turns out the two monologues on this found audition tape were both from the series after all.)* It took me well over an hour to finish watching the finale, on account of rewinding my TiVo repeatedly because of all the damn mumbling. Those of you who watched without a DVR, could you make out Erroll’s lines or Rust’s final speeches? And if you were watching on the problem-plagued HBO GO last night, how did you ever manage to finish?	Entertainment

802	"Editor’s note: This recap of the “True Detective” Season 1 finale, which aired Sunday (March 9), contains spoilers. Read no further if you have not yet watched Episode 8. Join TV writer Dave Walker and me at 9 a.m. Monday (March 10) in the comment stream below to discuss this series.The finale of HBO's “True Detective,” which aired Sunday (March 9), was unlike the seven episodes that came before it in that it told a linear story moving in chronological order from one event to another – straight as an arrow -- to a harrowing climax followed by an unexpectedly uplifting epilogue.One could quibble that the pieces of the investigation fell into place a bit too neatly, but the finale beautifully delivered what has made the police drama so compelling, Nic Pizzolatto’s terrific dialogue between the two partners, Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), that not only moves the action, but reveals who they are.Here's a look at what went down on Sunday.The killer… or one of the killers? We finally get to see the world through the eyes of one of the bad guys. The finale opens with scarface, the lawnmower man, standing in a ramshackle shed talking to someone we cannot see. “Them flies are getting thick,” he says. “Somebody ought to give you a good hosin’. Heat ain’t helpin’. Reckon you’ll keep another day. Be good. I’ll bring you some more water around noon. Bye, Daddy.”He comes inside and, after pausing to watch Cary Grant and James Mason on television sparring in “North by Northwest,” he drops his hillbilly accent to adopt Mason’s refined tone. The Mason accent is even more jarring given that he and his wife/sister/lover share a filthy house strewn with rags, books, old dolls, children’s clothing…“You want to make flowers today?” asks the woman, who appears to be mentally challenged. “You haven’t made flowers on me for maybe three weeks. Makes me sad is all.”He pulls her on his lap and begins to caress her, and he asks her to tell him about grandpa: “I was in the cane fields and he caught me when I was alone…”Next, we catch up with Cohle and Hart, who force Sheriff Steve Geraci to watch the video that Cohle showed Hart. As Geraci watches, the camera cuts away, and we hear him cry out, “Oh, Jesus Christ. Why are you showing me this?” “That little girl is the one you said went to see her daddy, Marie Fontenot, circa 1990,” Cohle tells him.The sheriff says he filed a missing juvenile report, but that the then-Sheriff Childress marked it “report made in error.” “I just followed what the big man says. It’s how this all works,” Geraci said.  “Nobody ever gave me a reason to second-guess it. It’s chain of command, right?”Cohle and Hart threaten the sheriff that if anything happens to them, copies of the tape and all of the evidence they have gathered will be mailed to police and the press. (We later see one of those envelopes is addressed to The Times-Picayune.)Back at the office, Hart starts thinking about the green-eared spaghetti monster that chased the little girl through the woods.“Why green ears? Assuming that’s our guy?” Hart asks, and he pulls out old photos from the houses that the then-detectives canvassed in ’95. One of them is a bright green house. He compares it to a photo of the faded house today. Hart and Cohle resolve the pastOn the ride to the green house, we are treated to another classic Hart and Cohle exchange, as they drive along rural Louisiana roadways. “Something’s been bugging me the last 10 years. Not every day, just now and then,” Hart says and then asks Cohle if he held back during their final big fight in 2002. As they talk it out, Hart tells him: “Yeah, you know when she (Maggie) told me, she said not to blame you; that it wasn’t your choice. You were drunk, and she made it happen”. “Everybody’s got a choice, Marty ... I sure blamed you,” Cohle says.“Blamed me for what?” Hart asks.“For pushing a good woman to the point where she had to use me, use our partnership to get rid of you.”“You know she couldn’t have used you (if) you didn’t want her some,” Hart says.“There you go. Everybody’s got a choice.”The pair goes back and forth about the past, but finally Cohle tells him, “I never told you how to live your life, Marty.”“No, no, no, you just sat in judgment,” Hart says.Cohle mumbles something about people being “sentient meat,” adding, “However illusory our identities are, we craft those identities by making value judgments. Everybody judges, all the time. Now, you got a problem with that, you’re living wrong.”Hart waits a beat and then asks:  “What’s scented meat?”The last piece of the puzzleThe pair finds the owner of the green house and learn that she did have it painted bright green in the early 1990s and that one of the men who painted it “had scars along the bottom of his face.” By searching the woman’s husband’s tax records, Cohle and Hart discover that Childress and Son Maintenance did the job. They find an old address for Billy Childress and plan to head there, but, in the meantime, as insurance, Hart meets with Detective Thomas Papania, the younger detective who questioned both Cohle and Hart.The detective is still dubious, but he agrees to take Hart’s call, if the two come across hard evidence.And, good thing too, because when they drive up to the Childress house in the woods, Cohle takes one look and says: Call Papania.When Hart can’t get a signal on his cellphone, he moves toward the house to use the phone inside and Cohle says, “Marty, this is the place.”  Hart is greeted at the door by lawnmower man’s woman, who says she doesn’t have a phone, but Hart breaks in and, eventually, finds the phone. Meanwhile, Cohle heads into the woods where he sees lawnmower man in the distance.Hart heads out to back up Cohle, stopping in the shed where we first saw lawnmower man. Chained to the bed is a long-dead man with his mouth sewn shut.  Soon Hart and Cohle, guns drawn, are searching – separately -- for lawnmower man in an overgrown brick structure. Inside is debris, as well as children’s shoes, clothes, and large devil catchers. As Cohle searches, a man’s whisper keeps luring him, saying things, such as:“Come on inside, little priest.” “To the right, little priest.”“This is Carcosa.” “You blessed Reggie, Dewall, acolytes, witnesses to my journey ... I'm not ashamed.“Come die with me, little priest”It’s super creepy.Cohle finally comes to a large room that feels almost like a cathedral, with a circular opening in the roof that lets the sun in. An altar of sorts is decorated with skulls and antlers. As Cohle looks around, he has one of his hallucinations when the wall disappears and he seems to be looking at outer space. Suddenly, lawnmower man stabs him, and a gruesome, bloody fight begins until Cohle head butts the giant man and they fall away from each other. He comes back at Cohle, but, by then, Hart arrives and shoots him just he throws an ax and hits Hart with it. Hart and lawnmower man begin fighting, but just as lawnmower man is about go in for the kill, Cohle shoots and kills him.We hear sirens and the two detectives, Gilbough and Papania, arrive just in time.A resolution of sortsAt the hospital, the two detectives tell Hart that they’ve connected the lawnmower man to the Dora Lange and the Lake Charles cases. Maggie and Hart’s two daughters visit him.And we hear a snippet of a newscast explaining: That lawnmower man was Errol William Childress and that he is responsible for dozens of missing people, but that state attorney general and the FBI have “discredited rumors” that the Childress was in some way related to Louisiana  Senator Tuttle.Hart goes to visit Cohle in his hospital room when Cohle finally wakes up from a coma. Cohle opens to up to Marty telling him that he saw Childress in 1995.“I saw him Marty. He was on that schoolyard on Pelican Island in ‘95. I couldn’t tell how tall he was cause he was sitting and his face was dirty, but I saw him.” “That’s what’s buggin you?”“Tuttle. The men in the video. We didn’t get ’em all.”“And we ain't gonna get ’em all. That ain’t what kind of world it is, but we got ours.”“I’m not supposed to be here,” Cohle says.Next, the camera takes us on a trip to the various key sites in the case, the Childress house, the Ledoux compound, Pelican Island and, finally, the huge oak tree in the sugarcane filed where Lange was found in Episode One.The beginning of a beautiful friendshipFinally, Hart visits Cohle again at the hospital. The simple gesture of Hart, giving Cohle the gift of a pack of cigarettes sets off an exchange of dialogue that is well worth transcribing. Hart roll Cohle’s wheelchair away from the hospital, so Cohle can light up.  As he smokes, Cohle says,  “I shouldn’t (expletive) be here, Marty.”Hart says no kidding…“I don’t’ mean like that. It’s something else.”“So, talk to me Rust.”“There was a moment I know when I was under in the dark. Whatever I’d been reduced to, not even consciousness, a vague awareness in the dark. I could feel my definitions fading. And beneath that darkness there was another kind. It was deeper, warm, like a substance.  I could feel, man. And I knew, I knew my daughter waited for me there. (Hart kneels at his side) So clear. I could feel her. I could feel … I could feel a piece of my pop, too. It was like I was part of everything that I ever loved. And we're all -- the three of us  -- just fading out. And, all I had to do was let go. And I did. I said darkness, yeah, yeah, and I disappeared. But I could still feel her love there -- more than before. Nothing. Nothing, but that love,” and he breaks down weeping. “Then, I woke up. “Hart reminds Cohle about how when Cohle was younger he used to make up stories about the stars.  Cohle says that in Alaska there wasn’t much else to do other than walk around and explore and Hart finishes his old partner’s thoughts: “And, look up at the stars and make up stories. Like what?”Cohle says that he’s been looking out the hospital window every night and thinking: “There’s just one story. The oldest.”“What’s that?” Hart asks.“Light versus dark,” Cohle says.“Well, I know we ain’t in Alaska, but it appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory,” Hart says.“Yeah, you’re right about that,” Cohle says.Cohle tells Hart to take him away from the hospital, getting up out his wheelchair.“You know what, I’d protest, but it occurs to me that you are un-killable,” Hart says.They walk with Cohle hanging on Hart’s shoulder.“You know you’re looking at it wrong, the sky thing,” Cohle says.“How’s that?” Hart asks.“Once there was only dark,” Cohle says, adding, “You ask me, the light’s winning.”And the camera pans up to the stars twinkling in the night sky…. What is the real revelation of ""True Detective""? It's not whether the partners caught all of the bad guys and brought them to justice. They didn't. It's that Cohle somehow pulls back from the extreme darkness that he was living in. And, Hart and Cohle (get it? heart and soul) are united forever by this experience.I’m gonna miss those two.

Don’t play the next one straight.”We don’t know much else about True Detective season 2 except for the following things:1) Matthew McConaughey won’t be back. The actor confirmed this at the 2014 Oscars last week. It’s not necessarily a surprise because the series is an anthology, meaning the show will have new characters and stories every season. Chances are that Woody Harrelson won’t be back either. Or anyone else for that matter.2) The story may be set in Southern California. Pizzolatto hinted at this in an interview with BuzzFeed when he said he’s been “reading about the last 40 years of Southern California government.” With the new location will also come new colors. “South Louisiana was green and burnished gold,” he noted.We’ve also heard that the show will use a few directors for season 2. This is a departure from season 1 which was entirely under the direction of Cary Joji Fukunaga. Time will tell if this is a good decision or a bad one. Viewers have been so captivated by the story, thanks in part to all eight episodes being under the direction of one person, because it offered a cohesive feel. The entire first season was penned by Pizzolatto, who will do the same for season 2.True Detective season 1 wrapped last night on HBO and brought the story to an appropriate conclusion. Though Hart and Cohle weren’t able to nab all the bad guys, they did get the one who they’ve believed was the biggest threat. While Rust wished they were able to grab them all, Marty reminded him that “that ain’t the kind of world it is. But we got ours.” Check out our recap for more details.We want to hear your thoughts on this topic! Why not submit an article to Hypable?View CommentsAdvertise with usExclusive content. A new design.

        ""True Detective"" ended its critically acclaimed first season Sunday with an episode that left fans feeling more than satisfied. The criminal drama's former detectives Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) finally caught their guy — if not everyone responsible for the heinous acts done to the many young victims.

        Cohle and Hart were able to find The Scarred Man's — aka Errol Childress — den of horrors (and his aunt/girlfriend, along with his decaying father), where they engaged in a bloody showdown with the killer, nearly ending the two ex lawmen. 
      
        And in the end, fans witnessed something that had been missing for much of the show: the real friendship between the two men. Not only that, McConaughey's fatalist revealed he had some hope in his heart: ""Once, there was only dark. Ask me, the light's winning.""
      
        It was a finale that delivered some answers, but not all. Who made those little twig sculptures and the video that sent Hart and Sheriff Geraci reeling? Who was The Yellow King?

        But not everyone was able to watch the conclusion of the HBO drama as it aired. So many people logged onto the network's app during the show that the app crashed.

          The finale of True Detective was silly and awesome, and awesomely silly. The one thing you definitely can't say about it is that it failed to commit. I immediately rewatched certain scenes because I could not stop laughing at them, but the show gave me nightmares anyway. (That old man with his mouth stitched shut and his eyes wide open — oof.) Was the final hour disappointing? Was the whole miniseries? Yes and yes, I suppose — if you expected True Detective to tell a story you have never, in any sense, heard before. 2001: A Space Odyssey aside, I can't think of a quasi-mystical tale full of metafictional elements that built and built but did not in some sense disappoint. No matter how cleverly an artist stimulates the mind, the power of our dread and curiosity will still exceed the work's ability to match them. It's hard to imagine the unimaginable. When you try, you usually end up with a rearrangement of things already seen — in which case the work is wise to build the idea of disappointment, or anticlimax, into the story itself, as writer-director Francis Coppola did in Apocalypse Now, a work that True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto has surely seen once or twice. (A likelihood that recapper Kenny Herzog made strong note of in his writeup.)None of the above is meant to excuse that final action sequence at Errol Childress's weed-and-ivy-strewn lair. Although it was brilliantly executed by series director Cary Fukunaga, conceptually it was a dud. After all that buildup, all that talk of visions and memories and time, all those allusions to the Yellow King and H.P. Lovecraft and even Kurt Vonnegut (the ""time is a flat circle"" business was reminiscent of the description of how the Tralfamagorians in Slaughterhouse Five perceive time), Rust Cohle and Marty Hart ended up in a variation of the climax of, well, pretty much every serial killer story you've ever seen, confronting a human monster in his maze while listening to his disembodied taunts and inspecting his art installation (serial killers always have art installations; just ask the profilers on NBC's Hannibal, which foregrounds the idea). It was as Rust inadvertently predicted earlier, a dream with a monster at the end of it. The finale leaned on animal cruelty and incest for its ""ick"" factor — Errol's half-sister's euphemism for sex, ""making flowers,"" is a phrase you can never un-hear — and it used exceptionally gruesome violence to jack up the excitement of Rust and Marty's final confrontation with Errol. The brutality was so extreme that it momentarily obscured the fact that the whole sequence was comprised of moldy clichés, from the Silence of the Lambs–style exchange between Marty and Errol's half-sister in the doorway to Rust in the monster's lair, laid low by a hammer blow and a stab wound, recovering his partner's gun just in time to make a spectacular kill shot. I loved the finale anyway, though, because — like the rest of True Detective — it had a slightly crackpot vision and stayed true to it. The tale kept track of a dazzling array of motifs throughout its eight hours and stocked the final hour with callbacks to them. And it struck just enough peculiar and surprising notes throughout (particularly by setting the story in three different time periods, which gave the repeated situations a poignant and sometimes haunting quality) that you never felt that you were just being jerked around. I keep mentioning high-water marks of '60s and '70s American cinema whenever I talk about True Detective with friends, because many of that era's classics (like Apocalypse Now) were grandiose and self-aware riffs on seemingly played-out genres, infused with signs and symbols that were easily dismissed as pretentious, but that added a mysterious something that transformed a story into an Experience. True Detective is all those things: a story and an experience; a grandiose, self-aware, pretentious riff on buddy-cop pictures and Chinatown-style conspiracy thrillers and serial killer narratives and art-house puzzle-films and many other modes besides. And it's funny — often deeply funny — in a way that such revisionist projects typically aren't. (Rust and Marty's hospital bedside exchange of middle fingers is a bonding moment for the ages.) And it passes at least two of what I consider to be tests of great popular art. First, it walks a fine line between sincerity and self-parody that makes audiences wonder, ""Are they kidding with this?"" The answer is usually ""yes and no."" (David Lynch is probably the king of this sort of thing, though David Fincher, whose Se7en and Zodiac clearly influenced True Detective, is no slouch, either.) Second, if you pose the question, ""What is True Detective about?"" you'd get a different answer depending on whom you asked, and every answer would be equally valid, and there'd be enough Venn-diagram-style overlap between the ""abouts"" that you could make a case for the work being rich and multilayered as opposed to wishy-washy or confused.In that spirit, then, here's my list of seven things that True Detective is about. In reverse order, because linearity is an abstract concept, man, all right all right all right. 7. Good Versus Evil  I offer this one first, or last, because duh, it's right there in the final scene in case you missed it. (""The light's winning,"" Rust tells Marty.) But here, as elsewhere, what makes the work memorable isn't what it's saying (there's darkness and light, good and evil) but how it says it. The sentiment isn't as clear-cut as, ""There are good people and there are evil people,"" because the show clearly does not believe that; quite the opposite. True Detective's people are kind, selfish, weak, cruel; it's all a matter of degrees. The duality of good and evil within every major character is never far from the script's mind, whether the detectives are visiting a revival tent or a strip club. The show's empathy extends toward Errol, a monster in the grip of compulsions like the title character of Fritz Lang's M, another child murderer who likes to whistle. (Speaking of classic films, although Errol imitates James Mason in North by Northwest, the voice evokes another, more appropriate Mason character — Humbert Humbert in the 1962 Lolita.) Errol seems to genuinely love his half-sister, and he's physically and emotionally damaged by the abuse he suffered as a child. He's scary and disgusting, but you can't hate him — not in the way that you hate action-film bad guys. And even when the show goes overboard with the symbolism (that cutaway in episode six to the ceramic devil and angel on Beth's dresser as she's riding the adulterous Marty), it always seems to fit within the show's moral and philosophical continuum, which seems influenced equally by Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, the Old and New Testament, ""hardcore"" graphic novels like Sin City and A History of Violence, and the scene in Night of the Hunter where Robert Mitchum shows off his ""Love"" and ""Hate"" tattoos. 6. The Banality of Evil  Not that it excuses the familiar imagery and situations in the final action scene, but I don't have much patience with anyone who complains that the end of True Detective sucked just because the killer turned out to be some random groundskeeper who'd been living under civilized society's collective nose for decades. The script had been preparing us for this sort of not-so-big-reveal from the very start, by making the story hinge on horrible acts that were allowed to continue for years or decades because people who knew about them kept looking the other way (see Rust's explanation for why he forced himself to watch the entire tape) or actively covering them up. The molestation and murder and general exploitation of children wouldn't have happened if people in positions of authority, including church officials, cops and politicians, hadn't hidden documents, quashed investigations, declared reports as having been ""Made in Error"" and so forth. (I love that there's just one letter's difference between ""error"" and ""Errol"".) As Geraci, who covered up the ""green spaghetti monster"" report almost a quarter-century earlier, told the partners, ""I just follow what the big man says. It’s how this stuff works ... It's chain of command, right?""5. Stories and Storytelling Related to my point above above, this is the umbrella that covers every other aspect of True Detective. The crimes depicted on the series were enabled by a series of deliberate omissions, elisions, distortions, and outright lies: holes in what should have been honest and transparent stories. I'm not just talking about the overall story of the molestations and killings, but all the mini-stories related via flashbacks that illuminate the three main characters, Rust, Marty, and Maggie. Rewatch the whole series and you'll see how carefully Pizzolatto and Fukunaga distinguish between what the 2012 investigators Gilbough and Panpania are told during their interviews and what actually happened. This is most apparent in episode five, Marty and Rust's coordinated cover-up of Reggie Ledoux's murder, but it recurs elsewhere in the series. Maggie never tells Gilbough and Panpania exactly why Rust and Marty split up (because she had sex with Rust to punish Marty for cheating yet again). When Marty asks Rust for a report on what Maggie told him back in 1995, after the first time he got caught cheating, Rust lies and tells him there's definitely hope for the marriage, because at that moment he needs Marty's support as he goes undercover again to sell an absurd story to those bikers and get close to Ledoux. The officials who funded those religious schools destroyed or buried financial and administrative records to obscure the horrible truth of what happened there, and in at least one case they threatened a man who found evidence of child molestation to remain silent or be accused of the crime himself. Sam Tuttle's illegitimate children and grandchildren are not officially part of his family tree, even though he continues to support them, and even though the people who worked for him knew that there were genetic anomalies in the family tree, they didn't talk about them. The show literalizes the notion of a hole or a gap in a narrative by building it right into its visual scheme. Every episode is filled with holes, spirals, pits, and the like. There’s the spiral pattern glimpsed in everything from tattoos to bird flocks; Rust's hallucination of a black hole in the ceiling of Errol's lair; the busted taillight of Rust's pickup; the thatched nestlike spiral that covers the hole in the tree where Dora Lange's body was found; the long shot of Rust in his hospital bed that makes his bruised and swollen left eye look like a tiny pit; the tiny round eye-size mirror that Rust stares into. And that's the short list.  4. Patriarchy, Specifically the White Male Variety True Detective is on shakier ground here than in most of the areas it ventures into, but give it credit for knowing what it's trying to say, even if it doesn't say it well and often seems to be glorifying the same things it's criticizing. I don't think it's a coincidence that the story starts in one millennium and finishes in another, or that the show is so obsessed with the passage of time, the weakening of social prohibitions, and the crumbling and scattering of physical buildings, power structures, and institutions (including families, which Tuttle's former servant says ""were bigger then,"" ""then"" referring to the mid-20th century). Rust and Marty are a couple of badass southern white dudes kicking ass and taking names (""Do I strike you as more of talker or a doer, Steve?"" Rust asks, in the finale's crowd-pleasing-est moment), but the show's attitude toward them is more skeptical than celebratory, at times shading over into a lament for a couple of guys who don't realize, to quote Tony Soprano, that they came in at the end. Marty's hypocritical attitude toward his wife and daughters is positively Scorsesean in its misogyny. Never for a moment does the show pretend that he's got the right idea about fidelity, fatherhood, or anything else related to the women who live under his roof. He's got a gangster's idea of manhood: I'll do what I please, and you do whatever I tell you. He's the king of his castle, everyone else is a serf. Rust, meanwhile, is haunted equally by the death of his daughter (and subsequent guilt over his failure to preserve his marriage afterward) and his rocky relationship with his father, to whose home state, Alaska, he briefly returned; he's destroyed by his inability to live up to an unrealistic standard of manly strength, goodness, and patience. It makes both dramatic and rhetorical sense that Marty and Rust's interrogators would be two black men, and that many of the detective's most mortifying and self-destructive moments stem from their inability to deal with women in an honest and non-condescending way. The show's disinterest in race relations and inability to resist gratuitous T&A shots damages its credibility greatly in this department, but the notion that True Detective is purely a white male supremacist fantasy is not remotely supported by the evidence. 3. Christ Allegory  That shot of Rust post-stabbing, sitting upright in his hospital bed looking like a one-eyed risen Christ was the second funniest image of the evening, topped only by the subsequent shot of Rust looking at his own refection (as he so often does) in the hospital window, which made it seem as if he were floating among the stars. Rust is constantly railing against the notion that there's a God, indeed that there's a world beyond the one that we can comprehend through our senses. (""Certain linguistic anthropologists think that religion is a language virus that rewrites pathways in the brain."") But it's all a setup for a moment of otherworldly revelation. As Rust tearfully confesses to Marty at the hospital, his near-death experience convinced him that both his father and his daughter had a life beyond death, and that they were all part of a spiritual continuum, one that he might have joined if he'd had the nerve to let go.The final leg of this show could have been titled “The Last Temptation of Rust.” Early in the series, Rust admits to Marty that he focuses on the crucifix during meditation because he wants to understand Jesus' moment in the Garden of Gethsemane, when he contemplates and then willingly accepts the prospect of his crucifixion. Star Matthew McConaughey's performance is filled with little bits of body language that set up Rust's climactic crucifixion by Errol, who taunts Rust with Satanic jibes as he wanders through what looks like an underground forest made of leafless tree limbs, then hoists him up with that knife in the gut as if he were Christ nailed up on a cross. As if channeling his hero Paul Newman's performance as the title character of Cool Hand Luke (one of the most gloriously overripe Hollywood Christ allegories of the '60s), the actor's go-to motion is to raise his hands in the air in a faintly Christlike post, often after moments of violent confrontation, such as in his fight with Marty. And the closing image of the finale? Let's just say, preferably in a McConaughey accent, that there's a whole lotta crosses up in that shot. The last 15 minutes of True Detective are the character's resurrection, with Rust admitting to Marty that he could have slipped away in coma-land to join his daughter and father (forming a holy trinity of father, son and holy ghost?) but couldn't summon the nerve. This scene wallows in sentimentality — rather boldly so, considering that True Detective hasn't dipped into the bathos well up till now — but this tear-bath isn't coming from nowhere. The early episodes are filled with talk of suicidal impulses not acted upon (“I lack the constitution for suicide”), both individual and specieswide. In one of his lowest, nastiest moments, he advises the child-murdering mother to kill herself. All this would be insufferable if True Detective didn't find Rust rather ridiculous and mock him regularly, especially during the final couple of episodes, during which you sometimes get the sense that Pizzolatto is as exasperated with the guy as Marty is. A hilarious Marty line from the partners' first post-coma conversation sums up the show's raised-eyebrow attitude: ""Jesus, what's your fuckin' problem?"" 2. Bromance  Pizzolatto is on record owning up to True Detective's clichés (or ""tropes,"" as they are called by creative writing majors), and the mismatched buddy-cop duo is one that's dear to his heart. The partnership between Cohle and Hart is your classic Lethal Weapon–type partnership teaming a brilliant but unstable wild card and a more settled family man who just wants to do his job and go home, though the longer you live with it and stare at it, the more allegiance it seems to owe to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (Rust has a touch of Holmesian alienation and intellectual smugness, and he lives a spartan life). The bromance aspect really takes over in the last two episodes, which show Marty and Rust, who were burrs in one another's saddles for two decades, finally putting aside their differences and learning to be true friends, true partners, and true detectives. The eighth episode is one long buddy-cop mind meld, capped by the gory confrontation with Errol that ramps down with the bloodied Rust and Marty crawling toward each other like the doomed lovers at the end of Duel in the Sun, and resolving in the hospital with Marty wheeling Rust around like an elderly husband pushing his beloved wife through a nursing home and even presenting a gift-wrapped pack of cigarettes. ""If we were getting engaged, I'd have gotten a nicer ribbon,"" Marty jokes. 1. A Parable of Grief and Mourning.  As Rust clarifies in that monologue to Marty, the preceding 17 years of his life felt like a postscript. After the death of his daughter and the dissolution of his marriage, he sought out increasingly dangerous assignments that not coincidentally allowed him to lose himself inside cover stories, and give a performance as somebody that deep down he probably really wasn't. Every part of Rust's life and identity during this period, including his ostentatious, posturing atheism, was an attempt to push back against the feeling of futility. The undercover operations, the bouncing from drug cartel investigations to the homicide squad, even the extra-legal detective work between 2008 and 2012 in the storage locker, all represent one profoundly broken, grieving man's attempt to track and punish death in the form of criminals and murderers. Even in his hospital bed, Rust can't entirely let go of his obsession, preferring to fixate on all the bad guys he didn't catch. But then he does let go. A little. The ending is not entirely a happy one, but there are glimmers of happiness.

812	"Sunday outage of online service HBO Go left excited viewers in the dark as users were unable to access the finale of the hit crime drama• True Detective season finale review

At least healthcare.gov is free.In what may have been the second-biggest website failure of the young century, HBO Go, the cable channel’s online streaming service, crashed on Sunday night, deflating the anticipation of excited viewers settling in to watch the season finale of True Detective online.What went wrong? On Monday morning, HBO issued the following statement: “Due to overwhelming interest in the season finale of True Detective, HBO GO was hit with an excessive amount of traffic soon after 9:00 PM ET last night. The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal.”True Detective, with Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, enjoyed fantastic popularity in its first season, racking up 10.9m weekly viewers by the end of February, according to the the Hollywood Reporter. The company bills HBO Go as an alternative to live television, and access to it is restricted to HBO subscribers, who must pay a fee on top of a regular cable subscription.HBO Go went black for an unknown number of users at around 9pm ET, when the final episode of True Detective was scheduled to begin. Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.HBO sent a follow-up tweet Monday morning assuring users that “the issues affecting HBO Go last night have been resolved.” But how does a cable channel resolve the “issue” of a too-huge audience? And with the enormously popular Game of Thrones due to return on 6 April, will the unspecified ‘fix’ hold?Somebody call Jeff Zients."	Entertainment
813	"HBO got some good news and some bad news last night. The good news is that its ""True Detective"" series finale starring Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey was wildly successful. The bad news is that the episode's popularity overwhelmed its HBO GO TV Everywhere service, causing some viewers to be put on hold and causing a firestorm on social media.According to Multichannel News, the premium TV channel provider tweeted that it was ""made aware of an issue affecting some subscribers"" caused by ""overwhelming popular demand"" for True Detective on HBO GO. The tweet advised users to ""try again soon.""The provider did not offer any further technical details about what caused the problem or how many users were affected, the story said. Those who were, however, filled the Twitter space with invective, according to a report in USA Today.Ryan McGee (@TVMcGee) noted that ""HBO Go has turned into the ObamaCare website of online TV portals, apparently"" and another user, Dave Itzkoff, added ""Next week on True Detective: Marty and Rust frantically scramble to log onto HBO Go to learn what happened this week on True Detective.""For more:

814	True Detective, the HBO cop series that brought a pair of Hollywood heavyweights to the small screen for an eight-episode mini-series blending brooding character study, vaguely existentialist philosophy, obscure literary references and a convoluted serial killer plot — oh yeah, and plenty of sex — turned out to be a winning formula for the pay cable network.But HBO proved not quite ready for prime time when it came to delivering True Detective on the internet.Despite being ahead of the game when it created its online HBO GO service four years ago, well before its competition started offering programming via the internet, HBO’s online app could not handle the overwhelming fan demand to watch Sunday night’s finale of True Detective on their iPads and Roku devices.[Mild Spoilers Ahead]With hundreds of thousands — even millions — of fans attempting to log in and see Woody Harrelson and freshly-minted Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey catch an overweight psychopath who in the end, seemed inspired as much by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre‘s Leatherface as by Robert W. Chambers’ “Yellow King,” the HBO GO service simply could not handle the workload. Thousands of would-be True Detective viewers saw the above message, telling them “some videos may not be available at this time.”On its official Twitter account, HBO posted a somewhat friendlier, even a bit gloating message.Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we’ve been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.— HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014But not all True Detective fans were in an understanding mood.Hey @HBOGO, thanks. We’re paying for you NOT WORKING. pic.twitter.com/hDOrOdodPj— SINKANE TELL ‘EM (@Sinkane) March 10, 2014In fact, Twitter itself felt like was about to be overwhelmed with tweets from dissatisfied customers, that ranged in tone from the outraged to the snarky.Worried this is what I’ll look like by the time HBOGO loads the True Detective finale pic.twitter.com/pl9kTycI2j— Jake Laperruque (@JakeLaperruque) March 10, 2014Actually not all of the frustrated True Detective viewers were, in fact, HBO customers.HBO GO is supposed to be available only to people who have a cable subscription through a provider such as Comcast Xfinity or Time Warner Cable, and pay for a monthly HBO GO subscription on top of the basic cable package.But the 41-year-old cable network has made no secret of the fact that it will tolerate, even encourage, “piggy back” viewers — that is, people who borrow log-in credentials from their parents, friends or any other HBO subscriber willing to share.While some online services, such as Netflix, regulate this kind of log-in sharing rather strictly, HBO sees it as just another marketing gimmick.“What we’re in the business of is building addicts, building video addicts,” said HBO boss Richard Plepler, “and the way we do that is exposing our product and our shows and our brand to more and more people.”In other words, even though HBO might have been somewhat red-faced over its inability to stream the True Detective finale to everyone who wanted to see it, the network had to be delighted that the show had spawned a whole new level of addiction.[Images By Lacey Terrell/HBO]All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.

815	"SPOILERS“We didn’t get ’em all.”  – Rust Cohle
HBO’s superb ‘True Detective’ finale Delivers the “scented meat” and a promise of an unkillable character who had a profound emotional breakdown in the last scenes.‘True Detective’s’ Cohle and Hart Hopefully Will Reunite Down the Road, Some Thoughts – JIm Bridges/Jim Bridges/HBO – Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in HBO’s “True Detective.”Years ago, I shared a row on a plane heading to Washington DC with a woman who was in law enforcement. She eventually let it be known her local police work went from victim’s advocacy to actually working with detectives on child abuse cases that were sexual in nature. Her persistent work elevated her to a task force on the Federal level, and though she couldn’t be specific, she had a touch of the possessed Matthew McConaughey’s character Rust Cohle in her. She told me they could only chip away at the sloppy ones, but there were so many well-connected, politically powerful and rich men the world over in this game of collecting and sharing child porn, it had permanently changed her outlook on life and having a family of her own.Sunday’s finale of “True Detective” was intense, gripping, moody and creepy, and it underscored the whack-a-mole nature of the very clever pedophile who connects with like-minded in the service of protecting their very disturbing fetish/crimes. The eight-episode murder-mystery series took us to the coastal Louisiana where good ol’ boys and family political power were able to mask and gag some of the dirty family business. It’s an environment where someone can disappear really easily and not too many questions seem to get asked.“True Detective” also reveals the pitch-perfect chemistry for two Texas born actors, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, who together remind so many critics of Redford and Newman. That elusive heterosexual bromance exists for them, one that makes us want to watch them order a burger and chit-chat, let alone solve crimes.McConaughey took his Cohle down the Zen dickhead path, unable to process his grief and loss of his daughter, and Harrelson’s Hart comes to grips after losing everything because he is such a liar in denial. His lies wedge away his family and he is left with Cohle, each man broken and lacking in different but complimentary ways.The entire narrative of this leg of “True Detective” is underscored with the masks and lies we all wear to protect ourselves in daily life, whether its raw emotions, ability to square the truth with oneself or prison or worse for the evil that dwells in some.This juicy tale telling is from Nic Pizzolatto, whose potboiler Louisiana whodunnit with T. Bone Burnett’s haunting score and detectives Rust Cohle (McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Harrelson) has created a demand for the two to reunite somehow in a future run of the series, which will emulate the anthology style of “American Horror Story” with different casts and tales to solve.The series with Rust and Marty focused on a serial killer with a protected layer of well-connected types who have obfuscated evidence and information to shield the perverted desires of some very wealthy men.  Charismatic power has served our killer, preying on the young and poor who can easily be poached. Strange symbolic pagan art and twig structures define their killing grounds, laying markers for those who understand the portentousness.The production design for the labyrinth and lair of the Yellow King must be remembered for an award for excellence. The crafts often get overlooked in write ups, but Production Design Alex DiGerlando, Art Director Tim Beach and Mara LePere-Schloop and Set Decorator Cynthia Anne Slagter all deserve major kudos for drawing us into this Southern Gothic hell on earth that made us feel we had Spanish Moss creeping up on our leg.There is no plan at present for McConaughey or Harrelson to reunite these characters. But a strange alchemy occurred in the making of this series that is undeniable. We love when actors connect so genuinely, and make us laugh when the situation is grim. Hart is relatable for many men who screw up a good thing and hurt women they love, and Cohle breaks through and feels the loss finally of his child, cracking the medicated (booze and drugs) veneer of his driven detective who lives to work. Their foibles and flaws cement these characters as memorable for the ages, just like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.We all hope to see the “unkillable” Cohle and Hart chip away further at the cancerous mass of these concealed animals who are under the surface of our society still, lurking and waiting for opportunity. Got something to say about this?

As for their killer, the elusive Yellow King? Well, it turns out the color that really mattered was green.  After Rust and Marty's master plan to squeeze the truth out of Steve Geraci (Michael Harney) by making him watch the awful tape of Marie Fontenot's murder yielded no real results (Geraci's boss, Sheriff Childress basically shut the investigation down, and Geraci followed the chain of command), Rust suggests he and Marty pore over the case files with fresh eyes. Marty's fresh eyes land on a picture of a house they came across during the canvass after the Dora Lange murder. The house had a fresh paint of green paint on it. Could the ""spaghetti monster with green ears"" Marty and Rust have been looking for be the man who painted the house?Turns out he could. After a little digging, including visiting the lady who owned the house in 1995 in a nursing home, Rust and Marty learn that Childress & Son Maintenance was hired to paint the house. A check of their work records put them all up and down the Louisiana coast, adding credence to Rust's sprawling map of seemingly disconnected missing persons and murder cases. However, the company's owner, Billy Childress, didn't stop renewing his business license in 2004, and Marty and Rust can't find any proof that Billy had a son.But we know he did have a boy: our friendly lawnmower man Errol (Glenn Fleshler), who splits his days between staring at schoolchildren between paint strokes, taunting  his ""daddy,"" who is chained to a bed, and strangely alternating between a Southern drawl and a British accent with his wife/lover/half-sister. Fortunately for Marty and Rust, Errol is still living at Billy's old place, which the detectives track down. (Before they pay him a visit however, they make arrangements. Rust makes sure all the compelling evidence they have will make it to the media should they fail, while Marty makes sure Papania (Tory Kittles) will come to their aid should they find what they're expecting.)Winter Preview: Get scoop on your favorite returning showsAnd find it they do. While Marty tries to gain access to the house to call Papnia (damn spotty cell phone service!), Errol refuses to surrender and lures Rust into a terrifying, winding maze of horrors. (Serious props to the set design team.) ""This is Carcosa,"" Errol hisses (presumably from an invisible P.A. system). Once Rust makes it to the center of the labyrinth, however, he is distracted by one of his visions (of a dark cloud or tornado, it seems) long enough for Errol to sneak up behind him and stab him in the gut. ""Take off your mask,"" Errol yells as he holds Rust, impaled, off the ground. So, that's it? Just one crazy dude with a super-creepy backyard funhouse? What about all the occult rituals and the government conspiracy with the Tuttles? (Don't worry, that bothers Rust too, who laments both that he saw Errol way back in Episode 1 and that the other men on the videotape got away. ""We didn't get them all,"" Rust tells Marty, who replies, ""We ain't gonna get 'em all. That ain't what kind of world it is. But we got ours."")That ending is fine by me, personally. The level of engaged theorizing this show inspired is admirable, but perhaps, in reflection, it was misguided. Although the show was trying to solve a mystery, the show itself wasn't necessarily a mystery to be solved. Instead, I look to what was always at the core of Nic Pizzolatto's creation: the relationship - and philosophical debate - between Marty and Rust. And fittingly, that's where this story ends.Winter TV: Check out the must-see new showsAs he asks Marty to sneak him away from the hospital, Rust still seems to believe time is a flat circle. And he believes the story he used to tell himself about the stars in the Alaska sky is the same story that's always existed: light vs. dark. But somewhere along the way, he's become a bit more optimistic. As Marty reflects on Rust's most recent philosophical babbling, he looks into the sky. ""The dark has a lot more territory.""While listening to those final words, I was instantly reminded of something Pizzolatto told me during an interview before the season began. ""While it appears this is a story going straight to the heart of darkness, and it very much does, I'm also more interested in how people wait out the darkness ... and what it's like to emerge out of the darkness,"" he said. It's hard to think of this episode, one that was tautly terrifying at several points, as a ""happy ending."" But it seems Rust has perhaps begun to emerge from the darkness - and maybe he's pulled Marty out of it too. With this show, that's about as happy as it could get.What did you think of the True Detective finale?View original True Detective Finale: A Happy Ending? at TVGuide.comOther Links From TVGuide.com

            There is a lot to discuss.
          Fear not: Our trusty True Detective recapper Kenny Herzog is organizing his thoughts about the final episode and furiously typing away — we’ll run his recap first thing in the morning. Also coming tomorrow is an analysis of True Detective’s first season by our television critic Matt Zoller Seitz as well as a big interview with ... well, check back tomorrow to find out. But for now, here’s a [obviously spoiler-heavy] place where we can discuss the events that just occurred in the finale. And clearly, there is a lot to discuss, including:1. Errol’s British accent. So bizarre, yet as creepy as the millions of dolls lying around the house and his idea of foreplay. (What movie was he watching, by the way?) But he was an effectively menacing villain— a mix of Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs and the Peacock boys from the ""Home"" episode of The X-Files.2. “L'chaim, fat-ass."" Rust's closing salvo to Steve ""Just Following the Chain of Command"" Geraci, is among the better one-liners in the history of television. How much will it cost Geraci to repair the sniper holes in his Maserati?3. They got their bad man. But any other insidiuously heinous men (Louisiana Senator Eddie Tuttle, et al.) will go unpunished/un-shot in the head. But getting even the one guy is part of Rust's light vs. dark theory — the light is winning. Did the finale tie up all the loose ends? Did it create more questions than it answered?4. Did anyone see an upbeat ending coming for this show? Marty and Rust, essentially moseying off into the sunset. Prediction: In 30 years, those guys will be the protagonists of Nic Pizzolatto's remake of Grumpy Old Men.In Conversation: Quincy JonesAmerica Is Great, But Olympic Skater Adam Rippon Just Wants to Make Reese Witherspoon ProudBarack and Michelle Obama’s Official Portraits Are RevealedWhat’s New on Netflix: February 2018Every Episode of Black Mirror, Ranked From Worst to BestSee what’s new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBOHomeland Season-Premiere Recap: Welcome to the ResistanceThe Obamas’ Official Portraits Rise to the OccasionAdam Rippon Has Nothing to Say to Mike Pence, Which Is a Shame, Because Everything He Says Is GoldKim Cattrall Does Not Want ‘Hypocrite’ Sarah Jessica Parker’s Condolences at This TimeWhat Made Mirai Nagasu’s Triple Axel So IncredibleLike many internet trends, it was heavy on aesthetics and light on substance.Ruffin, the host of the Writers Guild of America East awards, slammed the Real Time comic.The Netflix series is being adapted from the graphic novel and comic by Gerard Way.Why rise to the No. 1 spot when you can just buy it?This show could be one of the all-time Star Trek greats.Zac Efron, please take a shower.A former neighbor had accused the singer of groping her at his home in 2016.They join stars Andrew Rannells and Don Cheadle.And it shows no signs of slowing down.Starting March 31.Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald join the canon.Whether for inspiration, fitspiration, or thirst.“You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV.”… some of these five come-from-behind conditions are met.Director Tom Tykwer on the dance clubs, flapper girls, and political violence in his new Netflix show.Parents have complained about a scene where Peter Rabbit uses a slingshot to force-feed a blackberry to a farmer who is allergic to the fruit.Is Reileen the true mastermind of Altered Carbon?Painted by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald.Everyone from Kristi Yamaguchi to Reese Witherspoon reacted. “Reese has been a wonderful support system in teaching me the ways of modernity,” Portman said.© 2018, New York Media LLC.

""They welcomed it. Not at first, but right there in the last instant, it's an unmistakable relief because you see, they were afraid. And now they saw for the very first time how easy it was to just let go.""To Rust Cohle, death looks like release. He sees life as an extended cosmic joke, human beings as dumb meat suits convinced of their own importance, and religion as a crutch grasped at by the weak. The moment of death - which he's studied in the eyes of too many corpses - is when the truth as he knows it emerges, that there is no system and nothing that has come before meant anything.Marty, on the other hand, perfectly embodies the self-deluding believer endlessly crying ""Me, me, I, I"", who Rust caricatures in his 2012 interview. He can see 40 and it scares him, he loves two women at once, he wonders if he's a bad man, and so on and so on and so on. He's endlessly tormented by drama of his own creation, and it's this that obsesses him rather than the increasingly intricate murder investigation that's occupying Rust.Both these men are control freaks, but to different ends: Marty drinks and screws around and self-destructs to avoid looking into his own future, while Rust fixates on the job, ""keeps his eyes on the crab traps"" like the fisherman to avoid the same. And as Maggie points out, they're both trapped by their own stubbornness.There are a lot of locked rooms in 'The Locked Room' - the literal interrogation room, the human mind as Rust understands it, and the figurative four-walled space within which people set their own limitations. ""You put a ceiling on your life because you refuse to change,"" a frustrated Maggie tells Marty, who used to be smarter before he stagnated and took everything for granted.Similarly, when she tries to force Rust to push through his ""ceiling"" he refuses, preferring to be alone in his familiar way than pursue a relationship as she suggests.The theological debate which Rust and Marty get into here is so interesting in part because neither one of them is wrong. So much of True Detective could risk feeling like self-indulgent pontificating, but every single exchange works as character development as much as philosophy. Rust is dismissive and crass about the church congregation's average IQ and tendency towards obesity, but he's also right about religion dulling critical thinking. And Marty's a hypocrite, but he's also right when he tells Rust ""for a man who sees no point in existence, you sure fret about it an awful lot"".Rust's point-blank atheism, his nihilistic insistence that nothing means anything, is its own kind of delusion. He takes shelter in his belief system just as much as Joel Theriot's parishioners do, and so when he's arguing the point to Marty, he sounds panicked. Unlike Marty, though, Rust doesn't wonder whether he's a bad man; he knows he is. And the audience is left to wonder.The dual timeline device is used to its best effect yet in this episode, wryly emphasizing the hypocrisy of Marty's idea that having a family gave him structure. ""People in our lives give you rules, and rules describe the shape of things,"" he explains, while in '95 he rolls up to Lisa's house tires screeching, ready to beat seven bells out of her date. Because just when he thinks he's wrested back control over his women, playing the pity card with Maggie who seems to give in almost in spite of herself, his twenty-something mistress dares to look beyond him.He doesn't see either Maggie or Lisa as people with their own desires and fears and needs, but as players on his team, pieces that he needs to keep in play. He's not especially concerned with why his daughter is drawing pornographic sketches at school, so long as she doesn't do it again. It's been a good while since he mowed his own lawn, but he sure as hell doesn't want Rust doing it for him either. The illusion of order and normality is what counts, even when his life is obviously in chaos.Marty lives for boundaries, while Rust exists between the lines - he can look at a man in an interrogation room and ""think how he thinks"". As he explains to his blind date, his synesthesia means his synaptic receptors are blurred; he tastes colours, hears smells, sees textures. He might be losing his mind, or he might be mainlining the secret truth of the universe. Either way, he has no use for boundaries.And it's his productive kind of obsession that leads him to make a connection between the Dora Lange case and another potential victim from three years prior, whose death was ruled as an accidental drowning at the time. The school she attended was part of Reverend Tuttle's foundation, one of the many that closed down in '92. And her boyfriend Reginald Ledoux shared a cell with Dora's ex-husband Charlie Lange.So, the monster at the end of this story is Ledoux, and the '95 plotline looks set to conclude in spectacular fashion next week with the much-referenced gunfight. But given how guarded and haunted both Rust and Marty seem in the present day whenever the detectives bring it up - and given everything we know about the show - this is not going to be a straightforward victory.Rust Cohle's Inspirational Quote of the Week:
""To realise that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memory, all your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room - a dream about being a person. And like a lot of dreams, there's a monster at the end of it.""Leads:
-	 ""If the only thing keeping a person decent is the expectation of divine reward, then brother, that person is a piece of s**t."" He might not be fun at parties, but Rust sure does talk some sense.
-	When Rust is in the living room with Maggie, he exchanges a look with Maisie and Audrey that goes on slightly too long not to be significant. Does he suspect that something's amiss with them? He doesn't know about the drawings, but he's already proved to have kind of a third eye for dysfunction.
-	That moment of tension in 2012 when Marty said ""coonhound"" was interesting. It's easy to see why the detectives would instinctively bristle, but it also feels like an overreaction - coonhounds aren't exactly a rare breed and the term should be familiar to any rural detective. Just a misunderstanding, or are they more suspicious of Marty in general than they're letting on?
-	Marty specifically didn't care whether Lisa and her date had sex; he just wanted to know whether she gave him a blowjob. The power dynamics there are so telling; just like the brothel madam told him last week, ""he doesn't own it like he thought he did"".
-	Rust in 2012 said that he ""came close"" to being married a second time - does that mean he'll be taking things further with the blind date from this evening? They did look pretty good dancing together.
-	When Rust told Maggie ""We know what we want, and we don't mind being alone"", was he implying that what he wants is her? He could just as easily have meant that he knows what he wants and hasn't found it at all, or that what he wants is to focus on the job and not have the distraction of a personal life.
-	Marty's older daughter Audrey is the one who's had more screen time so far - she did the drawings and presumably arranged the dolls in that disturbing scene last week - but I'm wondering if Maisie, the overlooked good girl who's always being sent to her room, isn't the one to worry for.
-	Rust's observation that ""this place is gonna be underwater in 30 years"" recalled his describing it as ""like somebody's fading memory of a town"".
-	Shea Whigham, who will be familiar to HBO devotees as Nucky Thompson's treacherous younger brother Eli on Boardwalk Empire, gives a brilliant, ferocious performance as church minister Joel Theriot here. He's also sporting some brilliant, ferocious sideburns.PREVIOUS ARTICLENEXT ARTICLE

She was interviewed in front of an audience by Marie Claire editor in chief Anne Fulenwider (far left) and joined by her “Mindy” costars Adam Pally and Ike Barinholtz. Kaling covered a lot of ground at the talk, during which she discussed being an Indian-American woman in the television industry, her Twitter skills (she has 2.8 million followers), and, reportedly, embarking on a second book. Her first, “Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns),” is out in paperback.© 2018 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC	Entertainment
821	"American writer/comedian Mindy Kaling, whose credits include the US adaptation of The Office and her own series, The Mindy Project, has delivered a scathing assessment of the gender and race gap on television.""I look at shows on TV, and this is going to seem defensive, but I'm just going to say it: I'm a f---ing Indian woman who has her own f---ing network television show,"" Kaling told a packed session at the film, music and interactive conference South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.""I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks these other shows [run by white men] why there are no women or women of colour.""Kaling was responding to a question about ""race in the world of TV"" put to her by the session's moderator, Marie Claire editor-in-chief Anne Fulenwider.""People have a higher expectation for me. They say, why aren't you doing enough? And the answer is, I always want to do more because people should always be doing as much as they can, but my full-time job is not casting The Mindy Projec-t,"" Kaling said. ""My life is constantly disappointing people, politically or something.""Kaling is the show's director, writer and producer. She is also its star, playing obstetrician Mindy Lahiri.Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, her father is Tamil born and was raised in Madras while her mother is Bengali and was raised in Mumbai.Kaling identifies as an Indian-American, although she told the panel at South by Southwest that she tried not to focus on that.Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's

            ""I think one of the things that's been helpful to me is [that] I try not to think that much about how I'm an Indian-American,"" she said.""I can't think about my legacy because it stops me from being productive. It's a distraction. I don't want to stop being who I am, but I can't rely on it.""However, she said that being an Indian-American woman in the comedy world was not without challenges.""People think that you're not funny because of the way that you look, [but] you can get so hung up and say, am I the victim of this situation? Or be like, I'm in charge of it.""A study compiled by the University of California, Los Angeles and released last year at the 27th annual National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications conference found that ethnic minorities and women remained ""woefully under-represented"" on cable and broadcast programs as lead actors, writers and show creators.The same study revealed, ironically, that shows with more diverse casts generally drew larger audiences.To the credit of Fox – the US network that airs The Mindy Project – it has been a long-time advocate of diversity on television.The network's chief operating officer, Joe Earley, told a 2013 executive conference that more diverse programming was financially beneficial.""Not only are you going to have more chances of a show being made here, more chances of a show being a success on TV, more chances of making it into syndication, more chances of a show selling globally and making you millions of dollars, but you are going to bring more viewers to our air and keep us in business,"" Earley said.In an interview given to the online publication Jezebel in 2011, Kaling said that gender and race were connected.""Even though casting for pilots and movies are open to most ethnicity for parts, there's just a scarcity of female parts in general in stuff,"" she said.""And then, if one of the cast members is a minority, there's such a relief with producers that there's very little incentive to cast two people of colour, if that makes sense?""I wish there were more women of colour on-screen in comedy, for sure. But I do think that's changing. All my favourite shows now compared to, say, even 10 years ago, have more diverse casts. It's slow, though.""The Mindy Project was renewed for a third season last week. It airs in Australia on the Seven Network.New User? Sign upYou are logged in as unknown Logout300 words

823	"Getty ImageWhen Mindy Kaling isn’t answering a moronic reporter about the color of guy she wants, she is defending the fact that she’s an Indian woman with her own network television show. Via Flavorwire:But when the time came to field questions from the mostly female audience, one woman posed this query: “You guys have a great, diverse set of characters, but was it a conscious decision for Mindy to be the only female doctor, and the only doctor color of show?” There were a couple of minutes of pleasant response, with co-panelists and Mindy co-stars Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally earnestly praising their female cast members. But by then, Kaling had lost patience: “I look at shows on TV, and this is going to just seem defensive, but I’m just gonna say it: I’m a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network television show, OK?”Good for her. It gets annoying when you hear a blithering idiot ask canned questions like that. This is why I couldn’t be famous. I can do the whole acting thing, but having to sit and listen to stupid questions without bludgeoning the interviewer with a sock full of quarters would be impossible. Keep going, Mindy.The audience applauded, but Kaling was just getting started. “I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks any of the shows I adore — and I won’t name them because they’re my friends — why no leads on their shows are women or of color, and I’m the one that gets lobbied about these things. And I’ll answer them, I will. But I know what’s going on here.” Some laughter (some of it nervous) echoed through the ballroom. “It is a little insulting because, I’m like, God, what can I — oh, I’m sitting in it. I have 75 percent of the lines on the show.”Man, you have to feel for the reporter for asking such a ridiculous question. But, no, you asked for it.“And I’m like, oh wait, it’s not like I’m running a country, I’m not a political figure,” she continued. “I’m someone who’s writing a show and I want to use funny people. And it feels like it diminishes the incredibly funny women who do come on my show… I don’t know, it’s a little frustrating.” And at this point, Pally piped up: “Well, we took two different tacks in the answer.”Note to self: Bring my A-game when attending SXSW next year. Also, bring some flip-flops, beer, 3 changes of clothes, a super soaker, fake mustache, and a Ninja Turtle helicopter that can also punch. I’m not very good at packing.Via FlavorwireWow… that is one unflattering banner pic!Stretch mark city on those arms.I saw an old office re-run recently and couldn’t believe how thin she was in like season 2.  I wonder if she’d be as touchy with a question about her weight as she is about her ethnicity.Yeah, great, wonderful, blah blah blah.In other news, Fox canceled Raising Hope. You may commence weeping and screaming at the sky now.They did?  Aww man.  I loved not watching that show.What the hell?!?! My wife and I just plowed through what was available online and it’s one of our favorite shows now. DAMN YOU FOX!!The 4th season has been pretty bad.  I’m ok with it ending.America’s really letting me down latelyAND ABOUT GODDAMN TIME TOOI’m with Dissident on this one, the show was pretty solid through most of season 3 but this season hasn’t been good.  Two years ago I would have griped but at this point, eh.too bad her f*cking show is not that f*cking good…Thank you!Well said.A better question would have been “Why were you so much funnier on ‘The Office’?”This.  The thing about her show, for me, is everyone else on there is funnier than her.@Horatio Cornblower I read an interview with BJ Novak and he was talking about how he feels he’s grown up a lot since the Office and is still figuring out what’s next.  By contrast, Mindy (the character) feels like Kelly in every aspect of her quirkiness.  So maybe it’s just less funny this time around, we’re tired of it etc.I may be tired or my reading comprehension may have gone to hell since grad school (probably both), but Kaling’s answer seemed to be a jumbled, rambling bunch of thoughts. Like she knew she was supposed to be insulted but wasn’t sure exactly how.Lunch Lady Arms.I fucking LOVED that helicopter.I’m not saying I spent 30 minutes looking for it in my basement…Yeah, I did.In my head-canon, Ryan was the one who asked the question.Hey, commenters, you know the rule: everything Mindy does and says is AWESOME. See also: Lena Dunham.er, um, sarcasmBring me Solo and the wookieI also love how Mindy manages to sputter a semi-coherent retort, and it’s “Mindy DESTROYS Stupid Reporter!!!!!11!”
Some laughter (some of it nervous) echoed through the ballroom.
… Which was at least 90% white. More if you don’t count the Mexican hotel employees.Fuck SXSW.I always wondered why Jeff Sorenson, phenomenal actor (his words, not mine), never forayed into the business. Now I know. Having to answer dumb questions.The man has standards, dammit.“I’m someone who’s writing a show and I want to use funny people […]”So lemme get this straight:
-person asks question “why no other women leads or doctors of color”
-female (of color) lead responds that she “wants to use funny people”
-ergo, she, female (of color) believes herself to be not funny, but wants the show to be funny, so hires people not like hergot it.Kaling is two women of color on the show."	Entertainment

If she’s not on the red carpet, she’s at home in yoga pants watching Netflix and eating potato chips.Fans of Mindy Kaling get ready, because another book is coming your way. The comedian is proving to be quite the force in Hollywood this month with the renewal of her FOX show, The Mindy Project, and the release of her second book.Kaling was at Austin's SXSW festival on Sunday when she announced the big news. The audience got excited, but Kaling, true to form, asked the audience to hold their applause until they read the book.She revealed her next publication while talking with Marie Claire's editor-in-chief, Anne Fulenwider, about her role as a female showrunner in Hollywood.She didn't share any details about the second book or when it will be published, but readers of her first book, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns), know it will be hilarious. Her first outing as an author resulted in a New York Times-bestselling memoir as it focused on her childhood and the beginning stages of her career in Los Angeles.The 34-year-old star has become quite an icon for women in power in Hollywood, not only for her gender, but also as a minority. However, don't single her out because of this.During the discussion she said, ""I'm a f***ing Indian woman who has her own f***ing network television show. No one asks any of the [runners of other] shows I adore why there are no women of color as leads, and I get asked this.""The TV actress also offered up some great advice to young women who are rising in the entertainment industry.She shared, ""Be really good. Have a great work ethic. But also be like, 'S***, Michael Fassbender is so hot.'""Spoken like a true Hollywood success story.SheKnows Media &dash; EntertainmentThe stuff you need to know, crafted just for you.

    The star of 'The Mindy Project' talks one-on-one with USA TODAY contributor Jennifer Jolly.
    Actress Mindy Kaling, right, chats with USA TODAY contributor Jennifer Jolly at SXSW.(Photo: Jennifer Jolly, USA TODAY)AUSTIN — Move over Justin Bieber. Newly crowned 'queen of comedy' Mindy Kaling proved one of the hottest celebrity sightings in town during Austin's SXSW festival this week, as Seth Meyers and other stars made appearances at the event.Kaling is the creator, executive producer, writer, and star of The Mindy Project, which was recently renewed for a third season. She also revealed that she's working on a follow-up to her 2011 bestselling book Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?With the Roku Lounge as the backdrop, Kaling spoke with us one-on-one, as a crowd of around 500 people gathered as closely as they could to listen in. At one point, a young woman sitting cross-legged on the floor about five feet away gushed over Kaling's brightly colored beaded necklace, before asking if she could sit on the star's pink pantsuit-clad lap.
    Contributer Jennifer Jolly sits down with Mindy Kaling, who talks about her work ethic and the best advice she's ever gotten.
    Kaling responded demurely before shifting back to more burning hot topics, such as why she doesn't like watching TV shows on a smartphone or tablet, ""It's too small for me, I need to be surrounded [by a big screen] … I don't find it satisfying to watch an episode of say, Walking Dead, like I can't be scared if it's that little [size], and be like 'Rick run, run, it's a walker,' if it's on a screen that [tiny].""Kaling also admitted that even though she's a prolific tweeter and loves to share her life experiences via Instagram (including a recent trip to the White House), she does not consider herself to be very tech savvy,""The fact that I can stream things on TV with my little Apple remote and I haven't lost it --  it's the size of a thimble -- I'm like a B-minus level.""Jennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech contributor and host of USA TODAY's digital video show TECH NOW.

	Here are some things we saw and experienced on the third day of SXSW 2014.
Running the Show: TV’s New Queen of Comedy
Marie Claire editor-in-chief Anne Fulenwider hosted this panel with actor, writer and producer Mindy Kaling and her fellow The Mindy Project cast members Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally. The ballroom was already half-full an hour before the panel, which speaks greatly to Kaling’s general popularity. Fulenwider and Kaling chatted about the fun-factor of Twitter, her creative process and how NBC, who she had worked for during her tenure as a writer for The Office, passed on her show before FOX picked it up. After a few question, Barinholtz and Pally were invited on stage to talk about how Kaling is as a boss, to which Barinholtz jokingly quipped that she’s like Kim Jong-un, but then said “she’s the best boss I’ve ever had.” The three castmates on stage together gave the audience a peek of what it’s like in the writing room and on set of The Mindy Project—they had the whole crowd cracking up with every one-liner and spot-on impression. A more serious moment came during the Q&A session when a audience member asked why the show doesn’t have more female doctors (Kaling plays an OBGYN) or doctors of color. Kaling was clearly frustrated with this question and said, “I know this is going to sound defensive, but I’m going to say it anyway: I’m a f**king Indian woman, who has her own f**cking show,” which elicited cheers from the audience and a regretful reply from the asker. Kaling also announced that The Mindy Project would be returning for a third season and that she’s writing a follow-up to her best-selling book, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?.
The Secrets Behind Addictive Storytelling
	This panel was already impressive before it started: It was packed to max capacity with people standing up in the back rows and sitting down on every square inch of floor space to hear what these industry experts had to say. The discussion, led by Hearst Magazine Digital Media president Troy Young, was an all-encompassing look at how different media industries, from magazine publishing to reality show production, create “addictive” and engaging content for consumers. Jonathan Perelman, the senior vice president of Buzzfeed, which is known for its highly clickable listicles and quizzes, spoke about successful brand-sponsored content, the popularity of the listicle and how Buzzfeed is trying to get it’s investigative and longform stories as highly shared as their cat videos. Joanna Coles, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan, touched on compelling stories that ended up being featured in the magazine, including one about a transgender musician, saying that in order for content to be addictive, it has to be good quality and it has to resonate with people in an emotional way. A&E executive Bob DeBitetto spoke from the successful television network’s perspective saying that part of the reason of why current shows, especially dramatic series like True Detective and A&E’s own Bates Motel, are particularly captivating is that great film and theater actors are migrating to television and producing an elevated level of content. He also revealed that his network spends a good amount of time discussing the shareability and the social media impact a show will have from research and focus groups, and having that addictive quality is important to networks with the proliferation of binge-watching shows that are available to viewers all at once like Netflix's House of Cards.
The Heart Machine
The Heart Machine, directed by Zachary Wigon, is a love story, or perhaps more of a heartbreak story, set in the digital age. The film takes place in present day New York City, where Cody and Virginia, who’ve never met in real life, are carrying out a relationship over Skype, because while Cody is in NYC, Virginia is doing a six-month fellowship in Berlin. Cody, played by John Gallagher Jr., who you may recognize from HBO’s The Newsroom, starts to become suspicious of Virginia’s whereabouts, believing that she’s lying to him and actually living in the East Village because of details he’s noticed during their Skype chats. His unconfirmed fears drive him to edge of madness: He stalks people who might know her and places she might frequent, hoping to get some answers, all while creeping out everyone he comes into contact with. Meanwhile, Virginia keeps up the ruse of being Berlin, but actually does live in the East Village like Cody suspects, and as the audience goes on this suspenseful journey to figure out the truth about this horribly messed-up relationship, the ending feels like a punch to the gut. Cody and Virginia, and everyone left in their relationship’s wake was incredibly well acted, and the point was driven home by the affecting ending: At the end of the day, it’s damaged, selfish people that ruin a relationship—not the often-demonized digital devices.

The American writer/comedian Mindy Kaling, whose credits include the US adaptation of The Office and her own series, The Mindy Project, has delivered a scathing assessment of the gender and race gap on television.""I look at shows on TV, and this is going to seem defensive, but I'm just going to say it, I'm a f--king Indian woman who has her own f--king network television show,"" Kaling told a packed session at the film, music and interactive conference South By Southwest.""I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks these other shows [run by white men] why there are no women or women of colour,"" she said.
                                Actress/comedian Mindy Kaling speaks onstage at ""Running the Show: TV's New Queen of Comedy"" during the 2014 SXSW. Photo: Travis P Ball
Kaling was responding to a question about about ""race in the world of TV"" put to her by the session's moderator, Marie Claire editor-in-chief Ann Fulenwider.""People have a higher expectation for me. They say, why aren't you doing enough? And the answer is, I always want to do more because people should always be doing as much as they can, but my fulltime job is not casting The Mindy Project,"" Kaling said.""My life is constantly disappointing people, politically. Or something.""  Kaling is the show's director, writer and producer. She is also its star, playing obstetrician Mindy Lahiri.She was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Her father is Tamil born and raised in Madras and her mother was Bengali and raised in Mumbai.Kaling identifies as an Indian-American, though she told the panel at South By Southwest she tried not to focus on that.""I think one of the things that's been helpful to me is I try not to think that much about how I'm an Indian American,"" she told the audience in Austin, Texas.""I can't think about my legacy because it stops me from being productive. It's a distraction. I don't want to stop being who I am, but I can't rely on it.""She did note that being an Indian-American woman in the comedy world was not without challenges.""People think that you're not funny because of the way that you look, [but] you can get so hung up and say, am I the victim of this situation? Or be like, I'm in charge of it.""According to a study compiled by the American university UCLA, and released in 2013 at the 27th annual National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications conference, ethnic minorities and women remain ""woefully under-represented"" on cable and broadcast programs as lead actors, writers and show creators.The same study revealed, ironically, that shows with more diverse casts generally drew larger audiences.To the credit of Fox - the US network which airs The Mindy Project - they have been longtime advocates of more diversity on television.The network's chief operating office Joe Earley told a 2013 executive conference that more diverse programming was financial beneficial.""Not only are you going to have more chances of a show being made here, more chances of a show being a success on TV, more chances of making it into syndication, more chances of a show selling globally and making you millions of dollars, but you are going to bring more viewers to our air and keep us in business,"" Earley said.In an interview given to the online publication Jezebel in 2011, Kaling noted the gender and race issue were connected.""Even though casting for pilots and movies are open to most ethnicity for parts, there's just a scarcity of female parts in general in stuff,"" she said.""And then, if one of the cast members is a minority, there's such a relief with producers that there's very little incentive to cast two people of colour, if that makes sense?""""I wish there were more women of color onscreen in comedy, for sure. But I do think that's changing. All my favorite shows now compared to, say, even ten years ago, have more diverse casts. It's slow, though.""Kaling's series The Mindy Project won a renewal for a third season last week.

Paintings Of Barack And Michelle Obama Unveiled At Portrait Gallery

President Trump's newly proposed budget includes a proposal to end federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, part of a package that includes $300 billion in new spending overall.

Barack and Michelle Obama will re-emerge on the public stage Monday in Washington, only this time for an event that has nothing to do with politics. 

We have to remove profit from the health care equation, just like Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase intend to do.

The White House released a proposed budget that is largely irrelevant, given Congress passed a spending bill last week that outlines priorities.

EASTON, PADreading the looks on their faces once they realized the recipe was truly easy as fuck, local grandmother Rosemary Guzzo, 79, confirmed Monday that she didnt have the heart to tell her family that any dipshit can make lasagna. No, I dont think I can bring myself to do it. Theyd be too crushed to find out I learned how to make Nanas famous lasagna from the back of a Barilla box, said Guzzo, explaining that the dish involved not some old-world secret guarded by generations of Italian matriarchs, but the layering of pasta, meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. You know whats hard to make? Souffl. Not lasagna. Any knuckle-dragging dumbass off the street can set an oven to 375 and pop in a baking pan. At press time, Guzzos daughter had asked her to write down each step so they could enjoy the family treasure for years to come.

Trump has proposed eliminating funding for several agencies, grant programs and institutes.

David Hasselhoff, who sang the theme to the orginal '80s homage cult short from David Sandberg, will also appear in the action-comedy from KatzSmith Productions.

831	AUSTIN, TX: When the question came, you could feel the room get just a little tense. The mood thus far had been jovial at “Running the Show: TV’s New Queen of Comedy,” a Marie Claire-sponsored panel discussion of The Mindy Project, spotlighting the show’s creator/runner/star Mindy Kaling, and the topics were fairly innocuous (her writing process, her next book, the recent Mindy/Danny cliffhanger). But when the time came to field questions from the mostly female audience, one woman posed this query: “You guys have a great, diverse set of characters, but was it a conscious decision for Mindy to be the only female doctor, and the only doctor color of show?” There were a couple of minutes of pleasant response, with co-panelists and Mindy co-stars Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally earnestly praising their female cast members. But by then, Kaling had lost patience: “I look at shows on TV, and this is going to just seem defensive, but I’m just gonna say it: I’m a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network television show, OK?”The audience applauded, but Kaling was just getting started. “I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks any of the shows I adore — and I won’t name them because they’re my friends — why no leads on their shows are women or of color, and I’m the one that gets lobbied about these things. And I’ll answer them, I will. But I know what’s going on here.” Some laughter (some of it nervous) echoed through the ballroom. “It is a little insulting because, I’m like, God, what can I — oh, I’m sitting in it. I have 75 percent of the lines on the show.”“And I’m like, oh wait, it’s not like I’m running a country, I’m not a political figure,” she continued. “I’m someone who’s writing a show and I want to use funny people. And it feels like it diminishes the incredibly funny women who do come on my show… I don’t know, it’s a little frustrating.” And at this point, Pally piped up: “Well, we took two different tacks in the answer.”You have to sympathize with Kaling, who has found herself in the position, throughout her show’s run, of doing much but being criticized (as in, say, the frequent criticism that her character only dates white men) for not doing more. It’s easy to grind an artist down with that kind of a barrage, and her argument that she just wants “to use funny people,” along with a later insistence that “my full-time job is not the casting director for The Mindy Project,” can sound like some kind of an (admittedly distant) cousin to Jerry Seinfeld’s recent comments about caring only about funny, to the detriment of diversity.Does Kaling get off the hook because of the giant strides in television she herself represents? Sure thing. But the pressures of having to be all things to all people can take their toll — most obviously in the extensive retoolings and cast overhauls that have occurred throughout her show’s two-season run. Asked about her personal strategy for creating real change, Kaling certainly doesn’t come up short on ambition: “I feel that I can just be successful, hire people that I think are cool, and try to live my life in a way that doesn’t cause embarrassment or shame to people. And try to be, at this point, a role model, and be on good behavior… And try to do a show that doesn’t offend people too much and isn’t irresponsible.”The sheer magnitude of that laundry lists prompted some chuckles from the SXSW audience; they were realizing, the more she added to it, that The Mindy Project might be a more accurate title than they’d previously thought.@2016 Flavorpill Media.

Having broken boundaries by getting ""The Mindy Project"" on the air, Mindy Kaling often gets criticized for not, you know, breaking more boundaries.Why doesn't ""The Mindy Project,"" in which Ms. Kaling stars as a successful doctor, include more women of color in the cast? Why does Ms. Kaling's character seem to only date white men?She's got an answer, though not one a broadcast network would allow on TV. ""I'm a fucking Indian woman with my own fucking network television show,"" Ms. Kaling said during a panel at SXSW Interactive on Sunday. ""I always want to do more, but my full-time job is not being a casting director for 'The Mindy Project.'""Answering a question about race in the world of TV from Marie Claire Editor-in-Chief Anne Fulenwider, Ms. Kaling said she tries not to focus too much on being an Indian-American woman, because it's a distraction and stops her from being productive. ""I don't want to deny who I am but I can't rely on it,"" she said. ""I can't just think about my legacy.""Working on a broadcast network has plenty of challenges as it is, amid a widely-proclaimed ""new golden age of television"" blooming over on cable and on Netflix. ""I've been on network TV since I was 24, so the fact that you can do whatever you want [on cable] is very jealous-making,"" said Ms. Kaling, who was a writer and cast member on ""The Office"" before creating ""The Mindy Project.""""We can't swear, we can't have sex, we can't have long pauses, we can't do episodes 29 minutes long."" The constraints ""hone you and make you better,"" she said, but also make it wrong to pit broadcast comedies like ""The Mindy Project"" or ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" against Showtime's ""Nurse Jackie"" during awards season.Castmate Ike Barinholtz, however, gushed about Ms. Kaling and the show on Fox. ""It's rare on network TV to do what she has done,"" he said. ""On cable you have Louis [C. K.] and Lena [Dunham] who have done that, but that's a small audience,"" Mr. Barinholtz added. ""For a humongous company to see your vision is cool.""Fox renewed ""The Mindy Project"" for a third season last week, so Ms. Kaling can probably bank on another year of questions about encouraging diversity in TV. ""I have to leave my job to talk about how important it is for women of color to have jobs, but if I want to go do my job they say I'm not supporting women,"" she said. ""My life is constantly disappointing people politically.""Shareen Pathak covers East Coast creative agencies, campaigns and the production side of the advertising industry for Advertising Age.

837	"Today, at the grand conference of cool pop culture SXSW, Editor in Chief of Marie Claire Anne Fulenwider ran a panel discussion entitled ""Running the Show: TV's New Queen of Comedy"" with Mindy Kaling.  And!  It was announced that there would indeed be a Season 3 for The Mindy Project!  Kaling, who was later joined by her co-stars (and employees?) Adam Pally and Ike Barinholtz talked about all sorts of things from Twitter to navigating TV as a woman and an Indian-American:""It's challenging to get your own show no matter what…One of the things that's been helpful to me is that I try not to think that much about the fact that I'm Indian-American. I've felt that constantly people assume I'm not funny. People will think that you're not funny because of the way that you look.""Maybe one sweet day, brown people won't feel discomfort with being Indian and American and funny.  While we were all sitting and waiting for that moment to come, Kaling attended a Marie Claire dinner in her honor because whatever, it's fucking Sunday. Image via AP."	Entertainment
838	When Mindy Kaling took the SXSW stage, she was wearing a hot-pink, sleeveless ensemble on an unusually cold and rainy morning in Austin, Texas: “I dressed for the Austin that I thought it would be,” she said, “I look like I went to Miami and my flight stopped here. It’s Antarctica here.”The actress-comedian-writer-producer, currently the star and creator of The Mindy Project, started off the hour-long panel, led by Marie Claire Editor-in-Chief (and Vanity Fair alum) Anne Fulenwider, by proving another talent—speed tweeting. Kaling, who has said, “If you can’t tweet in 45 seconds, it’s not the medium for you,” tweeted out a message (Miami? Austin? Antarctica? Where am I? #sxsw) on Fulenwider’s phone in just 17 seconds. How does she feel about her social-media presence? “It’s mostly just for me to tease my writing staff,” says Kaling, who has 2.7 million Twitter followers and counting. “It’s just for fun. If it were to become more than that, I wouldn’t do it.”The five-time Emmy-nominated actress, who says she always knew she wanted to write her own show one day, went on to discuss her creative process and what it’s like in the writing room of her successful Fox TV series, which was recently renewed for a third season. “People contribute and then things sprout from that,” she says of working with her writers. “It’s like having really creative conversations with your funniest friends.”Two such friends—castmates Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally—joined Kaling and Fulenwider on stage to talk about their boss. “Much like Kim Jong Un…he rules with an iron fist, but sometimes in that fist is a rose,” joked Barinholtz of Kaling’s role as creator, director, and producer of the show, continuing, “She’s the best boss I’ve ever had.”When asked if she liked being the person in charge, Kaling responded, “The one thing I do miss is being a part of the gang.__ __It’s such a fun job, there are hardly any complaints. The only complaint is that I want to be able to be like: ‘Fuck our boss!’”So, what’s her secret to balancing her many roles on the show? “The reason I’ve been successful is my Richard Nixon-like focus,” she says.An audience member asked Kaling, who published her best-selling book, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns), in 2012, if she had another book on the way. “I’m writing a book right now,” she replied. “I’m very excited about it. I’m gonna be finishing it probably at the end of this year.”Another audience member wanted to know more about the show’s mid-season cliffhanger, when Kaling’s on-screen character Mindy Lahiri and co-worker Danny Castellano (played by Chris Messina)finally kiss. “It became a matter of not if they should do it, but when,” Kaling said of the long-awaiting smooch. “The name of the first episode [after the mid-season break] is ‘French Me, You Idiot.’”The second season of The Mindy Project will continue on Fox on April 1st.More Mindy Kaling Goes Out to Lunch with John HeilpernCondé Nast© Condé Nast.Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 2, 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 2, 2014).Your CA Privacy Rights.The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.

839	"COPYRIGHT""I'm a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network show,"" exclaimed an exasperated Mindy Kaling at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, when asked by a member of the 2,000-person crowd why there aren’t more women of colour on “The Mindy Project.”""No one asks any of these other shows that I adore -- and I won’t name them because they’re my friends -- why no leads on their show are women or women of colour, but I’m the one who gets all of these things. “It is a little insulting. I don’t run the country, I’m not a political figure, I’m someone writing a show and I want to use funny people. What should I be doing? It’s a little frustrating to me,"" Kaling continued. “People have a higher expectation for me. They say, 'why aren't you doing more?' The answer is: I always want to be doing more, because people should always be doing as much as they possibly can. But my full-time job is not a casting director of 'The Mindy Project,' my job is producer-writer-star.""Being Kaling, she did this quite sweetly, and reassured the well-meaning questioner who was somewhat aghast at the response. But her gender and race are obviously issues that come up more than she'd like. ""I have to leave my job to go talk about how women need jobs as a woman of colour,"" she recounts at one point to panel interviewer Anne Fulenwider of Marie Claire. ""And if I say, 'I have to do my job,' then they say, 'but you're not supporting women then!' 'But I have to do my job.' 'Well, then screw you!' My life is constantly disappointing people politically.”She adds that she's rather jealous of her male colleagues who aren’t incessantly compared to each other like women in entertainment are. ""You don't hear, ‘Is Will Ferrell too Steve Carell-y? Is Danny McBride too Aziz-like? There's this mentality that there can only be one woman who is successful and funny and running their own show and if there's more than that you must hate each other, and no.” Kaling, who attributes her success to her ""singular, crazy Richard Nixon-like focus"" and said she’s currently working on a second book,  has been on network television since she was 24. She began as a writer-star of “The Office” (Kelly Kapoor 4evah!) before graduating to become the boss of her own show, “The Mindy Project,” which she told the crowd has been picked up for a third season.“It’s challenging to get your own show, no matter what. I’ve only lived my life once so I can’t compare it,” she said when asked earlier by Fulenwider about how much her race and gender may have hindered her.“One of the things that has been helpful to me is that I try to not to think that much about the fact that I’m an Indian-American. So many people will look at me and think ‘you’re different from everyone else.’ But I can’t. I can’t think about my legacy, it’s a distraction. I don’t want to deny who I am, because it’s so important to me, but I can’t rely on it.“In New York coming up as a standup, people will think you’re not funny because of the way that you look, so you say, 'I’m not going to think in these terms at all.' You have to ignore it. That’s my advice to people. You can’t get hung up on thinking, ‘Am I the victim of this situation?’ No, I’m in charge of it.”

Sunday. ""And the only way to combat that is to just be really good and also be those other things ... and have a great work ethic.""At just 34 years old, she is the creator and star of ""The Mindy Project"" on Fox. But despite loving her job, she doesn't always love being the boss, Kaling admitted.""I wanna be like, 'Fuck our boss,' but I'm the boss,"" Kaling said.Ike Barinholtz, who plays Morgan, and Adam Pally, who plays Peter, joined Kaling on stage for the panel and chimed in about their leader.""Much like Kim Jong-un, she rules with an iron fist,"" Barinholtz said, laughing.But it was clear watching their banter and on-stage rapport that Kaling is pretty great to work for.She shared a funny story about Pally recently ""pushing boundaries"" on set. He was loudly moving a box around and she told him to do it more quietly. He told her, ""It's a choice."" Pally responded to the story during the panel by saying, ""As an actor I've learned that you can get away with messing up if you just tell people it's a choice. ... Like, I'm so hung over, I almost missed this panel. And that was a choice.""The audience cracked up, but Kaling shot Pally a serious look afterward, reinforcing that she means business. (Watch the video below.)Kaling also gave audience members a glimpse of what it's like to work in ""The Mindy Project"" writer's room, which she calls ""gentle and loving.""""All the guys on my staff would identify as feminists,"" Kaling said. ""They're, like, dudes, but ... I always feel very lucky that I've just been exposed to smart, nice guys who love women.""When moderator Anne Fulenwider from Marie Claire asked if there are women on Kaling's staff, Kaling said yes, many, which was met with an uproar of applause. While flattered, she combatted it very matter-of-factly.""Everyone should hire women,"" Kaling said. ""I mean, I'm glad you're clapping for that, and I want to accept that, but I also say that ... that should be the way it is.""She said one thing she dislikes about being a female leader and role model is that it often takes away from her time to work.""I have to leave my job to go talk about how important it is for women to have a job,"" Kaling said.The mostly upbeat conversation with the cast took a slight turn when a female audience member asked if it was a conscious decision to have only one female, minority actress playing the role of a doctor on the show. Barinholtz and Pally tried to help Kaling answer, with Pally jokingly saying, ""We're trying to help you, here,"" but Kaling confidently jumped in.""I'm a fucking Indian woman who has my own fucking network television show. It's a little insulting ... I'm someone writing a show and I want to use funny people and it seems diminishing.""She later apologized to the woman asking the question, saying she was sweet and it wasn't directed at her.Kaling leaked that Pally, who usually plays a womanizing ""bro""-like character, will soon be going through a transition that makes him a little softer and more respectful. The actress also confirmed during the discussion that ""The Mindy Project"" has been renewed for a third season -- it comes back from its season-two hiatus on April 1 -- and that she is in the process of writing her second book, which she hopes to complete by the end of the year.   Also, here's Barinholtz doing his President Obama impression, because ... why wouldn't you want to see that?"

841	"ShareTweetShareShareTweetShareIn case you thought that SXSW Film Festival in no way applies to your life, think again ladies!  I know we're all filmed-out after this intense awards season, and maybe you don't have enough energy to care about the soundbites coming from SXSW right now.  But after reading what Mindy Kaling had to say during her panel, I think you'll change your mind.Kaling spoke to a packed room of around 2,000 fans about how hard it is to get a network show, let alone to be an Indian American woman show-runner.  Listen up, television industry, because Mindy has a piece of her mind to share with you:“I look at shows on TV — and this is going to seem defensive, but I'm just going to say it — I'm a fucking Indian woman who has her own television show.  I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks these other shows why there are no women or women of color.”Like her or not, she's absolutely right.  There's no denying that there is a serious lack of diversity in network television (just one of the many reasons I barely watch it).  Because she's a woman, and a woman of color at that, I can't even fathom the roadblocks she's come across in the industry.  Thankfully, she's never let that stop her.  After a successful stint writing and acting on The Office, she now stars,directs, writes, and produces The Mindy Project.  She's successful now, but she explains the hardships she faced along the way during her time performing improv: “People think that you're not funny because of the way that you look. I think one of the things that's been helpful to me is I try not to think that much about how I'm an Indian American. I can't think about my legacy because it stops me from being productive — it's a distraction. I don't want to stop being who I am… but I can't rely on it.”You can say that again, girl.  And based on the way Twitter blew up during her panel, it seems like plenty of people were glad to hear such confidence and honesty.  You keep doing you, Mindy!(Photo: WENN)ShareTweetShare©2017 Defy Media, LLC, All rights reserved.

844	"The creator of HBO’s hit show compares lack of film work for female stars with that of co-star Adam Driver, who’s been offered roles by Spielberg and the Coen brothers
Henry Barnes

Mon 10 Mar 2014 18.15 GMT


Last modified on Tue 19 Dec 2017 21.40 GMT

Lena Dunham has compared the recent success of Girls star Adam Driver with that of his female co-stars and cited the difference as symptomatic of Hollywood’s attitude towards women.Dunham, giving Monday’s keynote lecture at the SXSW film festival, said she was happy for Driver, but that the variety of film roles he had been offered since appearing in Girls contrasted sharply with the parts offered to its female cast members.“People are ready to see Adam play a million different guys in one year – from lotharios to villains to nerds. Meanwhile [co-stars] Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke and Zosia Mamet are still waiting for parts they can get interested in”.Dunham said there were few opportunities for women of the Girls cast past being typecast as “high school ditzes”. Of the female cast members of HBO’s cult show only Mamet has taken film work. Her movie career predates the show’s 2012 launch and has included small roles in Lisa Cholodenko’s The Kids are All Right and Noah Baumbach’s Greenberg. Meanwhile, Driver has been offered large parts in films directed by the Coen brothers and Stephen Spielberg. He is rumoured to be playing the villain in JJ Abrams’s reboot of the Star Wars franchise.Dunham’s own film career has been limited to starring roles in her own movies, a role in Joe Swanberg’s upcoming Happy Christmas and bit-part in Girls producer Judd Apatow’s This Is 40. “There’s no place for me in the studio system,” she said.Tiny Furniture, Dunham’s second feature, won best narrative feature at the 2011 SXSW festival. During her speech at this year’s festival she thanked Janet Pierson, SXSW’s head of film, for launching her career and introducing her to “the only part of my life I’ve really enjoyed”.Girls will return for a fourth season in 2015.Barbara Speed: She has been touted as the contender to Lena Dunham's throne – so why is Iranian-American filmmaker Desiree Akhavan starring in her rival's show?If the label 'comedy blonde' has to exist, at least it pertains to some genuinely great comic actors"	Entertainment

The actress took the stage in Austin, Texas for a speech detailing her personal journey from her days as a babysitter to helming her Golden Globe-winning TV series.She then turned her attention on entertainment industry executives, insisting that her female co-stars should be landing roles like her colleague Adam Driver, who is in talks to appear as a villain in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode VII.Dunham said, ""It's a rough scene (women in entertainment)... I think about this in relation to the cast on my show, which consists of three very talented women and also some very talented guys.""Our male lead, Adam Driver, has had a bang-up (great) year in movies which could not be more deserved because he's a ferocious genius with an incredible work ethic, and I've learned so much from him. But the girls are still waiting patiently for parts that are going to honour their intelligence and their ability.""She continued, ""The world is ready to see Adam as a million different men - playing good guys and bad guys and sweet guys and scary guys. The world is ready to see Adam do all that. It's not ready to see (Girls stars) Allison Williams, Zosia Mamet or Jemima Kirke stretch their legs in the same variety of diverse roles.""Allison is relegated to All-American sweetheart. Zosia is asked to play more flighty nood-nicks (bores). Even though both are capable of so much, they're not asked to do it. And this is not a knock on Adam's talent, which is utterly boundless and he's exactly the actor who should be doing all this. It's a knock on a world where women are typecast and men can play villains, Lotharios and nerds in one calendar year and something has to change and I'm trying.""Dunham ended her speech by insisting she wants to help change the industry's stance on women in Hollywood, adding, ""I want to be of service to the causes that are dear to me and be an agent of change specifically for women and girls, and on a purely selfish level, I want to continually challenge myself to grow as an artist.""This wasn't Dunham's first time at SXSW - in 2010 she won the festival's Best Narrative Feature prize for her film, Tiny Furniture.

It's not ready to see (Girls stars) Allison Williams, Zosia Mamet or Jemima Kirke stretch their legs in the same variety of diverse roles.  ""Allison is relegated to All-American sweetheart.

This wasn't Dunham's first time at Sxsw - in 2010 she won the festival's Best Narrative Feature prize for her film, Tiny Furniture.Girls star Lena Dunham took aim at Hollywood bosses during her keynote speech at the South by Southwest festival on Monday (10Mar14), insisting actresses are ""typecast"" and their talents are extremely undervalued in the industry.The actress took the stage in Austin, Texas for a speech detailing her personal journey from her days as a babysitter to helming her Golden Globe-winning Tv series.  She then turned her attention on entertainment industry executives, insisting that her female co-stars should be landing roles like her colleague Adam Driver, who is in talks to appear as a villain in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode Vii.  Dunham said, ""It's a rough scene (women in entertainment)... I think about this in relation to the cast on my show, which consists of three very talented women and also some very talented guys.  ""Our male lead, Adam Driver, has had a bang-up (great) year in movies which could not be more deserved because he's a ferocious genius with an incredible work ethic, and I've learned so much from him. But the girls are still waiting patiently for parts that are going to honour their intelligence and their ability.""  She continued, ""The world is ready to see Adam as a million different men - playing good guys and bad guys and sweet guys and scary guys. The world is ready to see Adam do all that.

849	"Val Powell03.11.2014LifeShare this PostGirls director and actress Lena Dunham made a joke about sexual molestation on Sunday night that didn’t quite sit well with fans.Dunham made the joke in response to a tweet she received commenting on her performance on this weekend’s Saturday Night Live. Dunham was invited to host the show, and in a segment—a sketch about Adam and Eve—she appeared nude. In a Twitter post, a user told Dunham that she doesn’t always have to do away with clothes all the time. Her response was a joke about a molesting uncle.Oops.A barrage of angry tweets came in, criticizing Dunham for the petty way she tackled the sensitive subject.Dunham immediately took down the tweet and apologized, admitting that she went too far, that her joke wasn’t so great and that she “should know better.” Her excuse for the gaffe was that she was really sleepy.I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy.— Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) March 10, 2014One user said in reply that Dunham herself wouldn’t stay mum in similar situations, noting that if anyone else came up with the joke and cited sleepiness as an excuse, Dunham wouldn’t have simply let it go. “Not if they were a fifty year old man,"" the actress said in return. The 27-year-old actress added that “joke flexibility” is something women can have a lot, ""Ya gotta get by in this world.”Dunham deleted the molestation tweet because she had been seeing a lot of different kinds of Twitter rage, she said, and realized that the long-running Saturday show had a bigger audience than what she was accustomed to. For the last of her back-to-back tweets, she posted, “Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.”But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.— Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) March 10, 2014Last year, Dunham won two Golden Globes for Girls and also won the Gracie Allen Awards as Outstanding Director. She had been nominated eight times for the Emmy Awards, and holds the honor of being the first woman to be named Outstanding Director in a Comedy Series by the Directors Guild.Image via YouTubeTags:lena dunham, molestation joke, SNL, Twitter

            By Tamara Ikenberg Everyone who watches HBO's ""Girls,"" and even those who actively try to avoid it, knows that the show's creator and lead actress Lena Dunham really likes to be naked onscreen. When Dunham hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" this past weekend, the SNL writers lampooned her penchant for random nudity by relocating Dunham's character Hannah Horvath and her bizarre boyfriend Adam from Brooklyn to The Garden of Eden in a sinfully funny skit. Hannah, as the first female in the world, refuses to put on a fig leaf, begs God to get her a book deal, and seeks advice from a serpent with Shoshanna's head and a typically weird Shosh hair-do. The highlight of the parody is SNL cast member Taran Killam's dead-on impersonation of Adam.Sample dialogue:Adam: Aren't you going to put on a fig leaf or something?Hannah: I don't see why that's necessary at all. I'm not going to conform to society's demands for me.Enjoy this biblical send-up of ""Girls"":And who could forget the greatest SNL Girls parody of all time? I forgot! I didn't include it when I initially posted this story!

Deirdre still can't believe SheKnows pays her to do what she loves. She began telling stories before she could even write. Once someone gave her a pen, there was no prying it away; so a degree in journalism was the only thing that made s...Girls creator, writer and star Lena Dunham made her debut on Saturday Night Live over the weekend. Amongst the many standout moments were Dunham's biblical parody of Girls, the SNL take on Scandal and guest appearances from Liam Neeson and Jon Hamm. All in all, it was a magnificently entertaining episode... as long as you don't mind seeing Dunham naked — again.The newest SNL parody of Girls was by far the highlight of the night. The skit took place in the Garden of Eden with Dunham playing as Eve and Taran Killam as Adam Driver playing Adam. Killam's hair flicking, twitchy and sighing version of Adam was a spot-on impersonation of Girls' leading man Adam. Meanwhile, Dunham brought all of Hannah's sense of entitlement and immense slowness to Eve's life as Adam's wife. The standout moment came when God warned her to stay away from the Tree of Knowledge.""Are you saying that in, like, a 'I suggest you don't?'"" Dunham asks. ""Or in like a 'Definitely don't' but with a side of 'Maybe do.'""God's response, ""Well, Eve, you're clearly gonna do whatever you feel like soooo, whatever.""We definitely believe that's how God handles any situation involving our generation.Later in the night, SNL's new cast member Sasheer Zamata took on Scandal's Olivia Pope and assigned nearly impossible tasks to her team. Dunham played the chipper, idiotic ""Kelsey,"" incapable of handling any assignment on her own. It showcased Dunham at her most annoying... and we loved it.The show even started with a message to Russia from Neeson. Later, Hamm stopped by and women everywhere threw their panties at the screen. You always know it's time for Mad Men to return when Hamm starts showing up on Saturday Night Live! We're just jealous that Dunham was there to meet him and not us.SheKnows Media &dash; EntertainmentThe stuff you need to know, crafted just for you.

853	"AUSTIN — “Something has to change and I’m trying” — that’s the message “Girls” creator Lena Dunham delivered with her keynote at SXSW on Monday, addressing the differences in opportunities for male and female actors in Hollywood as well as her distaste for Republicans.Adam Driver, a co-star of her HBO series, has been offered parts playing “villains, Lotharios and nerds all in one year,” she said of Hollywood’s gender imbalance, whereas “Girls” stars Zosia Mamet and Allison Williams have yet to see parts that offer them a chance “to stretch their legs,” Dunham said.Dunham added that she does not care for ratings (though she admits HBO wishes she did), Deadline Hollywood and Republicans (“I’m sure there are some good ones. I just haven’t met them yet”).Her 45-minute keynote largely ran though her life, growing up in New York with two artist parents (a painter and photographer) and her beg-borrow-and-steal mentality to filmmaking (she maxed out a credit card, donated her $5,000 worth of babysitting funds, borrowed money from her parents and her best friend’s parents to make her early DIY movies). The hyphenate constantly emphasized the importance of having a “ferocious work ethic” and to be perpetually working on something – a script, screenplay, short – anything. Creators should be creating, she said.

She traced her SXSW experiences, from having “Creative Nonfiction” rejected one year at the festival and then accepted the next, to feeling like her entree into the industry really began when she won an award in Austin for 2010’s “Tiny Furniture.”The 27-year-old also made sure several times to apologize for the “molestation tweet” that she sent and promptly deleted. Her account tweeted, “I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy. SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.” In back-to-back tweets she added, “But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.”Dunham also joked about the tweet, which the audience immediately forgave her for, a palpable “ooohhh” echoing through the auditorium.The two-time Golden Globe winner also spoke about budgets, or the lack thereof, saying, “Lack of budget is no longer an excuse. (I realized) holding up a camera and letting people wander around documentary style is no longer acceptable.”Dunham said she knows “there isn’t a place right now for me in studio-funded movies.” By holding down four jobs on “Girls,” she said she’s trying to change the role of women in Hollywood. To bolster her point she cited Cate Blanchett’s Oscar acceptance speech and a quote from dance legend Martha Graham.She fielded questions for 20 minutes, ranging from her favorite “Girls” episode (the one that aired this past weekend because of the host of women, including June Squibb, with whom she worked) to a guy who admitted that he and his fraternity brothers watch her show every weekend looking for advice.

In fact, her HBO hit show Girls is based entirely on its characters' inappropriate way of communicating with one another and the world, but the 27-year old actress might have gone too far with a tweet she posted after her ""Saturday Night Live"" hosting gig Saturday.

If she’s not on the red carpet, she’s at home in yoga pants watching Netflix and eating potato chips.She had a great weekend hosting on Saturday Night Live, but Lena Dunham caused quite an uproar on Twitter after her gig.

He's been making me!""That comment really got her followers in an uproar because it implied taboo topics like molestation and incest. As a result, Dunham quickly deleted the tweet and then had to write a few apologies on her account.I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy.SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.But I should know better, and do.

856	"Lena Dunham Jim ParsonsWhat did the critics make of Lena Dunham's hosting stint on Saturday Night Live, which aired on International Women's Day?So, reviews for Lena Dunham’s stint hosting Saturday Night Live have been a very mixed bag. While her sitcom Girls has been met with international acclaim, Lena also has her fair share of critics out there. Particularly those who slam the 27 year old for her regular nudity on Girls and, well, pretty much every other appearance she does. Her SNL hosting job last Saturday to mark International Women’s Day was no exception.Funny woman Lena Dunham hosted last weekend's Saturday Night LiveThe highlight for us, and many others who reviewed the sketch show, had to be the ‘Biblical Movie‘ sketch. Appearing as Eve, Lena characteristically wears no clothes, alongside SNL’s Taran Killam, who played Adam (Driver). Genius. The result was a smorgasbord of feminism, while Lena also customarily poked fun at herself (appearing surrounded by decimated apples).Sadly, Lena’s opening monologue wasn’t received with universal praise. The Daily Beast commented “From her opening monologue, Dunham was charming. But not effortlessly charming, which is usually the modifier when someone uses “charming” as an adjective. Dunham does this peculiar thing where her charm comes with very intentional effort. There’s something about her line delivery that makes the sort of sophisticated precociousness she gives off seem carefully crafted”. Ouch. Although they did admit that the rest of the show was, on the whole, stronger than recent episodes of the sketch show.Watch Lena Dunham arriving for the Letterman show:Screen Crush concluded that the episode overall scored a B- and felt ""‘like buying the generic brand ‘Saturday Night Live’"". Any comedian undertaking the task of hosting Saturday Night Live has got an extremely daunting job on their hands. Hosts of the show are scrutinised by the world and their performance is cited for years to come when people discuss whether or not they truly are a great comedian or not, depending on how their SNL played out.Unfortunately for Lena, despite all the promo work that went in to bigging up her big night, Saturday’s SNL averaged a 4.1 household rating and a 2.1 in adults aged 18-49 with Local People Meters. This means that household ratings were down 11% and 19% in the 18-49 market (the younger half of which is Lena’s target audience) in comparison to Jim Parsons’ SNL the week beforehand.Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons hosted SNL the week before LenaLena's performance on Saturday had many pros and cons. Lena certainly proved herself able to pull off a successful sketch as well as adequaetly hosting, although doubts about her ability to play anyone other than a diluted or accentuated version of herself have been raised.Did you watch Lena Dunham hosting Saturday Night Live? Do you agree with The Daily Beast that her charm isn’t effortless? What do you make of Lena's ability to play roles which are outside of her comfort zone, such as her Liza Minelli bit?So, reviews for Lena Dunham’s stint hosting Saturday Night Live have been a very mixed bag.

Lena certainly proved herself able to pull off a successful sketch as well as adequaetly hosting, although doubts about her ability to play anyone other than a diluted or accentuated version of herself have been raised.Did you watch Lena Dunham hosting Saturday Night Live? Do you agree with The Daily Beast that her charm isn’t effortless? What do you make of Lena's ability to play roles which are outside of her comfort zone, such as her Liza Minelli bit?

                    MELISSA ON SNL
                







Melissa McCarthy sizzles on SNL, making everyone else look boring.

 MORE >>





 In what turned out to be one of those lackluster episodes of Saturday Night Live, Lena Dunham tried her damndest to make us laugh and, not surprisingly, made herself the butt of more than a few punch lines.And even though the episode left much to be desired, there were still some must see moments that will for sure keep the internet buzzing for at least the next few hours.I really wanted to enjoy the Girls star during her first stint hosting the sketch show. I really did. But it just seemed as if everything was happening around her instead of because of or to her.This happens often though and usually isn’t noticeable until a chameleon like Melissa McCarthy takes the reigns.Here though, are a few of the moments in which Lena proved that she truly is a comedic genius.THE OPENING MONOLOGUELena started strong and quickly  began making fun of the nudity she is so often criticized for. We were very happy that Ms. Dunham chose to avoid a musical opening, as that has been done to death people…TO DEATH.“OHH CHILD” DIGITAL SHORTThis short is hysterical, because it’s so smart. You won’t see the end coming from a million miles away and Lena’s frustration throughout is spot on.BIBLICAL MOVIEMaybe it’s because I love Girls so much, but I would 100% see The Garden of Eden as interpreted by Shoshanna, Hannah, and Adam.“SCANDAL”I usually don’t like these sketches, because they alienate anyone who doesn’t watch the source material. This time around though, Lena plays a character who says exactly what the audience is thinking.That wig though….not good.WEAKEST SKETCH: THE KATT WILLIAMS SHOWLena as Liza seems like it should have been a good idea.And, for the record, Ellen DeGeneres did not call Liza Minnelli a transvestite. She called her a Drag Queen. Yes, there is a difference.SURPRISE GUESTIn a sketch that was kind of funny, Mad Men star Jon Hamm dropped in to a very awkward situation.Any follow-up questions?"	Entertainment
858	Lena Dunham isn’t afraid to leave little to the imagination as evidenced by her nakedness on Girls and stripping down yet again during her debut on SNL. And she equally isn’t afraid to speak her mind on Twitter. For example, when she defended Dylan Farrow’s allegations that her adopted father, Woody Allen, sexually abused her as a young child.So, in turn, making fun of molestation may have been taking it too far.And she’s willing to admit her mistake.After taking it all off in an SNL skit about Adam and Eve over the weekend, an online fan tweeted, “you don’t always have to get naked!”– leading the 27-year old to quip: “Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He’s been making me!” As you can probably imagine, the playful retort wasn’t well received among social media fans far and wide.So, just as quickly as she made the ill-conceived joke, she took it down and apologized for offending anyone.Watch Lena get in the buff on SNL in the video below.	Entertainment
859	Lena Dunham. (Photo by Fred Duval/FilmMagic)Lena Dunham has apologized for tweeting a joke about molestation.  The “Girls” star, who regularly strips off in scenes for her hit TV series, appeared on the sketch show “Saturday Night Live” over the weekend, and mocked her penchant for nudity by shedding her clothes in a skit about biblical figures Adam and Eve.  The sketch irked some viewers, with one taking to Twitter to tell the actress, “You don’t always have to get naked,” to which Dunham quipped: “Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He’s been making me!”  The star later deleted the post and apologized for the remark, writing, “I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy. SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy Girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of Twitter rage.  ”But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.”	Entertainment
860	"Although she didn't get nude in promos for Saturday Night Live, Girls star/creator Lena Dunham did strip down for a short film on the show.In her opening monologue she acknowledged the nudity in Girls, saying, ""Every show has its thing.Seinfeld had the puffy shirt. Home Improvement had the neighbor talking over the fence. And we have very graphic sex scenes. That's our thing.""So it made sense that she was in the buff for a Garden of Eden bit in which she said things such as, ""I can eat this, right?"" pointing to an apple. ""Like if I wash it?""And after devouring many apples, she told God, ""Can you please not apple shame me right now?! Seriously, I know I committed original sin, but at least it's original. I think I deserve some credit for that. Or at least a publishing deal.""Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

861	"COPYRIGHT""Girls"" creator Lena Dunham returned to SXSW in Austin, Texas a few years after winning the interactive, film and music festival's narrative film prize in 2011 for her debut ""Tiny Furniture,"" with a call to action in Hollywood. ""It's a rough scene. It's hard to always offer comforting words on that topic. I think about this in relation to the cast on my show, which consists of three very talented women and also some very talented guys. Our male lead, Adam Driver, has had a bang-up year in movies which could not be more deserved because he's a ferocious genius with an incredible work ethic, and I've learned so much from him. But the girls are still waiting patiently for parts that are going to honour their intelligence and their ability,"" Dunham said. ""The world is ... not ready to see Allison Williams, Zosia Mamet or Jemima Kirke stretch their legs in the same variety of diverse roles. Allison is relegated to All-American sweetheart. Zosia is asked to play more flighty nudniks. Even though both are capable of so much, they're not asked to do it. ""This is not a knock on Adam's talent, which is utterly boundless and he's exactly the actor who should be doing all this. It's a knock on a world where women are typecast and men can play villains, Lotharios and nerds in one calendar year and something has to change and I'm trying.""Dunham, whose keynote was written last night ""high on the quaalude known as cheeseburgers"" and attracted an even larger crowd that that of Edward Snowden, the infamous ex-CIA analyst-turned-whistleblower, said she didn't care about ratings. ""HBO would like me to feel differently [but] I never expected to have a television show, and now that I do, I never expect to have one with blockbuster ratings. It's enough to have the platform,"" she said, adding she's more focused on being ""an agent of change specifically for women and girls, and on a purely selfish level, I want to continually challenge myself to grow as an artist.""She also offered advice for people who might want to get into the entertainment business.""Don't wait around for someone else to tell your story. Do it yourself by whatever means necessary.""

The list of childhood dreams that Dunham is getting through of late is really something. From the Archie comic, to hosting SNL and somewhere along the way she went on a double date with President Obama and First Lady Michelle (!!!)Dunham's boyfriend Fun guitarist Jack Antonoff posted a highly saturated photo of the foursome on his Instagram two days before Dunham made her SNL debut, with the caption ""a really sick double date"". Um yeah, sure beats any double date the rest of us have been on ever.We're not sure when the date or happened, or why, or what they ate, or what they talked about (if only!) but we sure do wish we had been there. It hasn't been all roses and the realisation of childhood dreams for Dunham this week though. She attracted the wrath of the internet (is there any other kind?) when she tweeted, and then later deleted, an ill-advised joke about child molestation. As E! reported, a Twitter user told Dunham, ""You don't always have to get naked!"" to which Dunham replied, ""Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He's been making me!""Kudos to Dunham for being both classy and a bigger person than most people on the internet, she later apologised in a series of tweets.I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy.SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.But I should know better, and do.

866	Why?What’s with the vomit on “Girls”?I have to be careful about “Girls,” because the last time I wrote about it, things got a little crazy. (No, not the time I called the show brilliant. The other time.)Also read: ‘Girls': About That Semen SceneIn January, I asked Lena Dunham during a Q&A why her character, Hannah, is naked so much. She didn’t like the question and accused me of not being into her. Which wasn’t what I said, but she has a right to not be into my asking.Because, to be honest, there was a tacit criticism in my question — though it had nothing to do with Dunham’s appearance. It was this: I don’t know if “Girls” always knows what it’s doing.I like the show. I was delighted that its ratings improved after our fake controversy. But lately “Girls” is all over the place. Some elements — like the vomit — feel pointless.Also read: Lena Dunham Reacts to Naked Critics – Makes, Deletes Molestation Joke on TwitterIt’s not just me. The New York Times’ Neil Genzlinger wrote Friday: “Expanding boundaries needs to have a purpose. Graphic vomit rarely passes that test.” He conceded that his viewpoint might make him seem like a fuddy-duddy.There’s a writing rule I love: Chekhov’s gun. If you introduce a gun early in the play, it has to go off. If you take up the viewer’s time with something in one episode, it should pay off in another. (A lot of “True Detective” fans think the show broke its Chekhov’s gun contract by not explaining the Yellow King. I disagree.)Also read: ‘True Detective’ Complaints: Calm Down, Internet“Breaking Bad” is the gold standard of Chekhov’s gun writing. Everything serves a purpose. As creator Vince Gilligan has said, the show uses every part of the buffalo.“Girls” does not. One episode last season, Adam borderline assaulted his girlfriend, Natalia. In the next episode, the heart-on-its-sleeve Season 2 finale, he broke down a door, Tarzan style, to lift her up and carry her away. When the new season began, there was no retribution for Adam’s very iffy behavior with Natalia. (Some fans call it a rape, but I don’t think the show intended it that way, since Adam was Hannah’s hero one episode later.)Seth Greenland, a writer I love, said once that a novelist’s job with a first draft is to vomit up 300 pages, and edit it into something coherent later. I think Lena Dunham is vomiting up lots of breathtakingly good ideas for “Girls.” But she’s not killing her darlings. Instead of an editor, she has Judd Apatow, whose movies, while great, tend to run too long.“Girls,” too, can feel overloaded.There’s self-indulgence for the sake of taking risks and pushing limits. “True Detective” is that kind of self-indulgent. But then there’s lazy self-indulgence — doing the shocking thing that gets people talking instead of the thing that makes sense. Or just not knowing what to cut.I want “Girls” to be the first kind of self-indulgent. I hope it’s not the second kind. But either way: artists should make big, bold choices, right or wrong.And they should also expect viewers to wonder why they made them. And be annoyed when they don’t serve a purpose.See video: Lena Dunham Gets Naked – Again – for ‘Saturday Night Live’Is the nudity supposed to be funny? To project vulnerability? Is it a middle-finger to the male gaze? All of those purposes would be great, though none happens to be the one reason Dunham gave me. She said it’s a “realistic expression of what it’s like to be alive.”One could make the case that a show devoted to realistically presenting life in Brooklyn might feature more African-Americans, but let’s set that aside for now.Showing Adam’s semen during that extremely iffy scene was a realistic expression of life: We felt violated, just like his girlfriend did. It felt horribly real. It muddied the water when we were supposed to root for Adam later, but maybe that was the point. Or maybe the show lost its thread. We don’t know yet how Adam’s story resolves.Showing Hannah throwing up also served an important purpose, story-wise: It was a quick, efficient way to show us that Hannah acted out against Adam by drinking too much. It was especially interesting given that Adam is a recovering alcoholic. This is a cry for attention that went too far. Okay.See video: Lena Dunham Asks Savannah Guthrie If She’s Willing To Show Nipple But showing us the actual vomit, like showing us a lot of the nudity, doesn’t really add anything. It just gets people talking. It feels like… dare I say it? Another cry for attention gone too far.Maybe it’s even an attempt to bait squares like Neil Genzlinger, with their painfully uncool aversion to spew. It worked.But do it too often, and it can start to feel like the emperor has no… nevermind.Tim Molloy is an editor at TheWrap. He wrote How to Break Bad News and another book that will be published someday.	Entertainment
867	This is an occasional feature wherein we discuss a bit of online etiquette currently in the news. You can find all our #etiquette posts compiled here.Lena Dunham — fan of fake burqas, perpetual nude and purported voice of her generation — is not one to shy from off-color humor. But on Twitter last night, she crossed a line that even her devoted, 1.45-million-strong fan base was unwilling to cross with her: She made a joke about molestation. And then deleted it.Yikes, Lena ″@lenadunham Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He’s been making me! RT @Bobbythornton you don’t always have to get naked”I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy.SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.Let’s start with the obvious here: First, Dunham’s joke is neither funny nor particularly clever. Second, her excuses ring desperate and a bit flat (“sleepiness” does not compel most people to forget basic social boundaries), though no doubt she’s legitimately embarrassed by the whole thing. To top it all off, Dunham deleted the tweet — a tacit admission of guilt.Which raises the relevant Twittiquette question: When you tweet something you shouldn’t have (bad joke, typo, factual error, Weiner-style selfie) should you deal with it … or delete?Frankly, “social media gurus” (air quotes obligatory!) don’t all agree on this score. They note, rightly, that nothing you delete from Twitter ever disappears entirely — your mistakes live on, zombie-like, in other people’s retweets and screenshots. So there’s often no use deleting something if you’re planning to pretend it didn’t happen. The truth could come  out in the end, making you look like a liar and/or idiot.But deleting something will slow its spread, which can be really important. If @WashingtonPost somehow garbles an important breaking news tweet, someone should probably delete (and correct) that tweet before the misinformation gets around. Likewise, if I accidentally post some compromising photos to Twitter, I don’t want those hanging out in my feed for all eternity. Deletion, followed by a quick “whoops, sorry about that,” would obviously do nothing to sooth my humiliation … but I would, at least, stand a shot of watching the whole thing disappear.TL;DR: It’s okay to delete tweets, as long as you’re transparent about it. In fact, since transparency is more or less an essential tenet of the web, you might want to bring that ethic to everything you do online. Dunham got that part right, at least.	Entertainment
868	Not even full on nudity could save Saturday Night Live from it’s second lowest ratings of the season over the weekend, as the Lena Dunham hosted show failed to pull in the viewers.There was a huge promo push for the Girls creator’s SNL debut that included her appearing on NBC’s Today and Late Night With Seth Meyers but all that extra effort didn’t exactly pay off.Figures show that the episode averaged a 4.1 household rating in the metered markets and a 2.1 in adults 18-49 in the markets with Local People Meters. That was down 11% in households and down 19% in 18-49 from last week’s show hosted by Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons. That means it’s SNL‘s second-lowest results of the season.27-year-old Lena shed all of her clothes as she starred in a spoof trailer for biblical movie, Noah in her first stint hosting the US show.The actress was seen running nude through an exotic green landscape -with her modesty protected by some blurring – playing Eve who eventually meets up with an equally naked SNL’s Taran Killam – who plays Girls actor Adam Driver playing Adam (confusing, we know).The segment prompted a bit of a debate on Twitter with some tweeters questioning Lena’s obsession with stripping off, with the actress also known for her nude scenes on her smash hit HBO show Girls.When one Twitter user advised her she “doesn’t always have to get naked”, the star responded with an ill-advised joke: “Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He’s been making me! (sic)”Lena quickly realised she may have gone too far, with the 27-year-old deleting the post and apologising to her 1.4 million followers. “I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy,” she confessed.“SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.“But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend. (sic)”	Entertainment

228 Views She’s had her fair share of body critics since stripping down nude in “Girls,” and now Lena Dunham reveals why she loves her anti-Hollywood figure in the April 2014 issue of Glamour magazine.During her interview, the HBO series’ star/creator opened up about how she handles her body’s haters and even shared details about her relationship with fiance, Jack Antonoff.“I think I radicalized my relationship to my own body in order to accept it,” Miss Dunham explained. “To make my body a prop in my work gave it a value I didn’t feel it had before.”She continued, “At the Golden Globes I had a little bit of fat bubbling over, but I love how that looks. It looks bountiful. It reminded me of corset dramas. There will be a point – maybe when I’m pregnant or when I have kids – when I just want to have my body for myself.”Also discussing Jack’s first remarks about her “infamous” figure, Lena stated, “I remember talking with him on our first date and him being like, ‘God, all the articles about your nudity on the show are such bullsh*t.'”In regards to Jack’s reaction to her success, the 27-year-old actress shared, “I think women are conditioned to stand by their man and watch them make it to the top, but most men never believe the person they get into a relationship with is going to rise any higher than she was when they met.”“It takes a very special, evolved person to be able to deal with change within a relationship,” she added.December 10, 2015January 6, 2015January 5, 2015Your email address will not be published.

          51View  commentsIt was meant to be a huge compliment.But Lena Dunham has taken issue with being called 'the Woody Allen of her generation' amid renewed allegations that the famed director sexually abused his adopted daughter.Talking to U.S. Glamour magazine, whose April edition she covers, self-professed feminist Lena makes her feelings about the Hollywood veteran clear.'I find the most recent revelations about his life really challenging,' she admits.Proud of her body: Lena covers Glamour magazine, and addresses the criticism of her for stripping off in Girls'I
 hated that Mia Farrow [his ex-wife] had been bullied because the man she
 was [splitting up with] was the most powerful cultural figure in New 
York and therefore nobody wanted to look at his behaviour.'And
 Lena gave her support to Dylan Farrow, who recently reignited the 
controversy by writing an open letter accusing Allen of sexual abuse.'I'm grateful to Dylan Farrow for her bravery in speaking out,' said Lena.Then she attacked Allen's response to the allegations, which he has denied.'I'm
 disapointed that Woody Allen thought discussing his ex's sexual history
 and shaming her was an effective strategy in arguing his innocence.'Lena added: 'I think I want my heroes to embody values I can agree with in their work and life.'In her wide-ranging interview Lena also
 revealed that her controversial decision to regularly strip off 
onscreen in her hit HBO show Girls has also helped her accept her own 
body.'I think I radicalised my relationship to my own body in order to accept it,' she explains. 'To make my body a prop in my work gave it a value I didn't feel it had before.And she has no issue with being fuller figured than her fellow stars.'At the Golden Globes I had a little bit of fat bubbling over, but I love how that looks.'It looks so bountiful. It reminded me of corset dramas.But while she embraces her body's imperfections, Lena says there will come a time when she keeps it offscreen.'They'll be a point - maybe when I'm pregnant or when I have kids - when I just want to have my body for myself.'Moving on? Lena Dunham has admitted she may quit acting to focus on writing and is relieved on days when she does not have to act While Lena, 27, has been regularly critisiced for stripping off in her show, one firm supporter is her boyfriend of two years, Jack Antonoff.'I remember talking with him on our first date and him being like ""God, all the articles about your nudity on the show are such bulls***"",' she revealed.And it seems Jack is the perfect boyfriend - coping well with Lena's success.'I think women are conditioned to stand by their man and watch them make it to the top, but most men never believe the person they get into a relationship with is going to rise any higher than she was when they met,' she explains.Opening up: While she embraces her body's imperfections, Lena says there will come a time when she keeps her clothes on onscreen





Prada SS14Buy in stores only...It's so great to see Lena Dunham on the cover of glossy magazines. It's about time we had inspirational women like her adorning the front page rather than air brushed models and actresses. While we love all those glamorous girls it's Lena we want to be like. And despite all the criticism she has received for going naked on her television show Girls  and for her appearance, here she is showing the world she's just as beautiful as any other cover girl. This dress looks fabulous on her too. It's from Prada's SS14 collection and we love the clash of the blue jewels on the scarlet shade of the fabric.While it was styled on the runway with a sporty green tunic underneath we like it on its own with just the hint of skin from the deep V and the cute cut out. If you want to get your hands on this dress you'll need to head to your local Prada store or why not head to the high street instead and check out the embellished red frocks we've found below?Boohoo has a Gatsby-esque number that's also a bargain or go one shouldered with TFNC at Asos.

The high point of Lena Dunham's all-around wonderful Saturday Night Live was this spot-on Scandal sketch that skewered the show's rapid-fire pace, sensational soapiness, and uncanny ability to have its characters solve any problem in a matter of seconds.Great!

Lena Dunham returned a conquering hero to the South by Southwest Film Festival and Conference on Monday, delivering a heartfelt keynote address that traced her swift ascension from New York art world scion to Emmy-nominated stardom and multi-million-dollar book deals.VIDEO: 'SNL' Recap: Lena Dunham Debuts 'Girls' Parody Follow-up ""I wrote this last night, high on the quaalude known as cheeseburgers,"" she joked in her signature self-deprecating fashion as she pulled out her notes, adding that she still had ""glitter and glue on my head from hosting SNL on Saturday.""Thus began Dunham's remarks -- ""part motivational tool, part rant"" -- as she went on to pay tribute to the Austin-based festival that served as the gateway between her younger, aspirational self and ""the only part of my life I have ever actually enjoyed.""""To me, this place represents magic, hope, beginnings, adulthood, freedom, triumph and tacos,"" said the 27-year-old creator and star of Girls, to applause.She then recounted in detail her beginnings, which started in childhood as an enthusiastic storyteller and playwright (a less-successful example was the play she staged in 10th grade set in an abortion clinic waiting room) and eventually evolved to short film experimentation in her late teens. VIDEO: Lena Dunham on 'SNL' 'Girls' Parody: 'One of the Best Things That's Ever Happened To Me'  Inspired by the emerging ""mumblecore"" scene -- ""a preternaturally irritating term"" for a kind of ultra-low-budget, character-based filmmaking she nevertheless deeply admired -- Dunham used $5,000 of her babysitting savings and at the age of 20 shot her first, 59-minute feature called Creative Nonfiction. That one was rejected by South by Southwest, but a subsequent short, Family Tree, was selected, immersing Dunham in Austin filmmaking circles and introducing her to Janet Pierson, the film fest's director.But it was her 2010 feature, Tiny Furniture, that put Dunham on the map in a big way. Selected by Pierson for inclusion in the narrative competition, the indie comedy went on to take top honors. (She admitted she had been tipped off ahead of time and worried that if the festival found out, they might have rescinded the honor for ""not looking surprised enough."")The film's success led to the ""couch-and-water-bottle tour of Los Angeles,"" where she sat with a series of development companies in search of the next big thing. It was a frequently humiliating process, she recalled, in which she was reduced to a series of ""this-meets-that"" descriptors: ""It's Ricki Lake meets Tina Fey. Kathy Bates had a baby with Rodney Dangerfield. Audrey Hepburn's deformed-daughter-that-she-kept-in-a-cage-until-10 meets Albert Brooks."" But a meeting at HBO proved the kernel that would lead to Girls, and set Dunham on her wild ride to stardom.STORY: Lena Dunham to Pen Archie Comics Arc Dunham said it took some adjusting to learn how to sit in a writers' room. ""I considered writing something that you go into your room and do at night, when the muse moves you."" Towards the end of the keynote, she shared the things that are important to her: ""I want to make people laugh. ... I want to be of service to the causes that are dear to me and be an agent of change specifically for women and girls, and on a purely selfish level, I want to continually challenge myself to grow as an artist.""Then she listed the things she ""absolutely [does] not care about,"" and at the top of the list is ratings. ""Unfortunately, ratings, which unfortunately HBO would like me to feel differently about. I never expected to have a television show, and now that I do, I never expect to have one with blockbuster ratings. ... It's enough to have the platform,"" Dunham said.Also on the list: Republicans. ""I'm sure there's some really great ones, but I haven't met them,"" she deadpanned.Twitter: @SethAbramovitch

881	"The Girls creator quickly deleted the tweet after she came under fire from her followersLena Dunham’s guest-hosting slot on Saturday Night Live continued to raise eyebrows well after she stripped naked for a Garden of Eden-inspired Girls spoof (scroll down to watch the video).The creator of the HBO series became defensive  when she received some negative feedback about her performance on Twitter.One follower in particular posted at her: “You don't always have to get naked!“To which she responded: “Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He's been making me!” Perhaps unsurprisingly, her retort was met with a fair amount of online criticism, with several followers citing the post as in poor taste.She soon deleted the post, and replaced it with the following:I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry
guys. I am really sleepy.
""SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage,” she continued. “But I should know better, and do.

          72View  commentsLena Dunham and her boyfriend Jack Antonoff have friends in very high places, judging by a photo the Fun guitarist shared on Thursday.In the picture, which was originally taken last summer, the couple are sandwiched between none other than Barack and Michelle Obama, enjoying a 'really sick double date,' as the caption explains.The 29-year-old musician shared the photo via Instagram just two days before his girlfriend's Saturday Night Live debut, which saw her hosting and acting in the show.Hipster power couple: Antonoff and Dunham have even taken their romance to the White House as seen last Fourth of July with First Couple Barack and Michelle Obama In the photo, Lena and Jack wear similar short-sleeved collared shirts, Jack pairing his with dark blue shorts and Lena wearing a black skirt with red polka dots. The President and First Lady look equally casual.Judging by their outfits, the shot was taken on the Fourth of July, when the couple were in D.C. for a barbecue at the White House and Jack's band performed.While they may seem like an unlikely foursome, the Girls creator has been very vocal about her support of President Obama in the past, even starring in a campaign ad promoting his re-election in 2012.'A supportive partner is somebody who says, ""You couldn't do 
anything that would embarrass me""'Lena, who stars on the cover of Glamour magazine's April issue, has been dating Jack since 2012, and she 
recognizes that the relationship comes with a fair amount of 'baggage' 
due to her controversial series.'The dialogue around the show already 
existed,' she told Glamour. 'So it was sort of clear to him what the 
baggage of dating me was going to be'But despite the controversy the actress often courts, her beau seems to take it all in stride.Flashback: The shot was likely taken on the Fourth of July, when the couple were in D.C. for a barbecue at the White House and Jack's band performed (pictured) Perfect match: Lena, who covers the April issue of Glamour, said of their first date: 'I remember talking with him... and him being like ""God, all the articles about your nudity on the show are such b*******""' She said of their first date: 'I remember talking with him... and him being like ""God, all the articles about your nudity on the 
show are such b*******.""'Another Jack has had to accept is how frequently she makes headlines - whether it be for her feminist views or for yet another naked scene on the HBO series.And again, it seems Jack has proved the perfect companion in this respect. She told the magazine that a supportive partner is 'somebody who says, ""You couldn't do 
anything that would embarrass me. Just be yourself in a way that has 
integrity and I'll be proud of you.""'The actress most recently made 
headlines for posting a tweet which seemingly joked about sexual 
molestation, causing offense to many fans.Courting controversy: The Girls creator recently made headlines after defending her nude appearance on SNL (pictured), posting a tweet that some saw as making light of molestation Following her appearance on SNL in which she played a nude Eve in an Adam and Eve skit, one follower tweeted: 'You don't always have to get naked!'The actress replied: 'Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He's been making me!' The tweet sparked an uproar on Twitter, with many accusing her of making light of molestation.  'I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed'Lena quickly took down the post and tweeted an apology, writing: 'I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys.

888	"ShareTweetShareShareTweetShareObviously still on a high from her SNL hosting gig, Lena Dunham momentarily found it super appropriate to joke about child molestation on Twitter. If your brain is currently screaming “Uh-oh, Spaghetti-Os” like mine did, you can at least rest assured that Lena's did as well. To her credit, she did delete the offensive tweet just before offering a series of believably sincere apologies. But that wasn't before Buzzfeed's Rachel Zarrell could immortalize it with a fancy little retweet.Yikes, Lena “@lenadunham Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He's been making me! RT @Bobbythornton you don't always have to get naked”— Rachel Zarrell (@rachelzarrell) March 10, 2014I feel almost certain that Lena was sort of trying to respond to something that she's tired of discussing in a clever way. But if ever there were a case of in-terribly-poor-taste, this is so it. Because, whether or not Lena's intention was to offend anyone, that's exactly what joking about the very serious and sensitive topic of sexual abuse will get you.

Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.— Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) March 10, 2014I'm very glad, for everyone's sake, that Lena jumped on the apology horse quickly and also sincerely. I realize that, like the rest of us normals, celebrities make mistakes sometimes. (Hellooo, even Beyoncé, celebrity-turned-diety, apparently messes up from time to time.) The joke was still totally out of line and not okay, but I'm willing to forgive Lena for this one because I'm a sucker for a genuine apology. Now, if only Lena could get into Shia Labeouf's troll-y ear about how to get people to actually forgive you, this world could be a different place entirely.(Photo: WENN)ShareTweetShare©2017 Defy Media, LLC, All rights reserved.

We all love Lena Dunham’s sarcasm but last night the Girls actress may have taken it a little too far.This week, Lena took her talents to SNL and as we reported yesterday, went completely nude for a parody about her HBO hit series, playing Eve, the first girl in Girl.When one fan didn’t seem appreciative of Lena’s naked gift to the world, tweeting: “You don’t always have to get naked!” things took a turn for the worse, as Lena responded:“Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He’s been making me!”Lena has since deleted and apologized for the insensitive tweet that took an inappropriate stab at molestation. Lena wrote:I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy.— Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) March 10, 2014SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.— Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) March 10, 2014But I should know better, and do.

	Oops. Lena Dunham's bad.
	Following a Saturday Night Live skit in which the Girls star appeared naked in a parody of Adam and Eve, a critic on Twitter told Dunham she doesn't ""always have to get naked,"" to which the actress replied:
	""Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He's been making me!""
	Dunham recently stood by Dylan Farrow and defended sexual assault victims, making the joke even more surprising and off-key.
	She acknowledged both these points via a follow-up apology.
	""I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy,"" Dunham wrote. 
	""SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage. But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.""
	Dunham has been asked about her penchant for nudity often over the years and is clearly sick of the topic.
	But she did have a great time hosting SNL.
	""Cannot overstate how joyful this experience has been,"" the native New York Tweeted yestreday. ""I have always loved you Saturday Night Live, but now I am IN love with you.""
	For more from Dunham, head over to TV Fanatic and watch Girls online.My mother and I have a massive fight when I choose to wear a banana-printed belly shirt and pink leggings to the Vatican.I am 20 years old and hate myself. My hair, my face, the curve of my stomach. The way my voice comes out wavering and my poems come out maudlin.Submissions? Questions? Looking to advertise?

892	"For some reason, what comes to mind for me when I think of last night's Girls is a list of idioms longer than one of Jessa's caftans. The more things change, the more they stay the same. And You can't go home again. And *The shoe is on the other foot.*See, after weeks of what I'd consider a lighter, sunnier Girls than seasons one or two, the show finally hearkened back to its DNA with a complex, discomfiting sex scene. (Despite Lena Dunham's joke, at the top of her SNL monologue, that ""graphic sex scenes are our thing,"" this season has been relatively low on them.)And truth be told, last night's Hannah-Adam exchange wasn't angry or morally iffy enough to rank among the show's most controversial bedroom throwdowns. In fact, I would say that as the show's sex scenes go, this was one of the funnier ones (granny panties under that strappy garment!). But from the wig to the sidewalk screaming to the harness itself—which reminded me of something out of The Cell—it was clearly a scene we'll someday see again in ""Girls' most iconic bedroom moments"" roundups.We don't know what will happen with Adam and Hannah now—Patti LuPone's dark warnings may be coming true. But I was barely thinking about that after last night's episode wrapped, because I still hadn't figured out what I thought of the role-play sequence itself. I can't say I've missed sexual dysfunction in the show this season—but then again, shouldn't a series get some credit for being true to its original self? And in terms of narrative: While some sex scenes on the show are so vivid, the characters themselves almost get lost in them, this particular set of high jinks was very Hannah. Before things got relatively dark in Marnie's apartment, I found myself giggling at Hannah's detailed characterization of her blond alter ego—and at her ambiguous accent.But here's my question: When the show returns to stuff like this, does it take your relationship with Girls—and Hannah—back a step? Does it make you love both more? Or is it the kind of thing you quietly endure because you love other aspects of the series? Three seasons in, the show continues to make headlines for Dunham's nudity; the general perception of it in the public is best summed up as ""sexually frank.""Still, as a regular, analytical watcher of the show, the sex stuff has never had a major influence on my opinion. It's not my cup of tea, but it doesn't make me want to throw the baby out with the bathwater either. Oh, cool! We came full circle with the idioms.But really—what did you think of last night's episode? Did it feel vintage Girls to you—and did you like the Hannah-Adam story line, or hate it? And what did you think of Hannah's lingerie?©2018 Condé Nast.

Lena Dunham is known for her sarcasm and outspoken nature, but even the “Girls” star realized she went too far with a joke she made on Twitter about molestation late Sunday night.After the actress appeared nude on “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, a Twitter follower wrote her, saying, ""You don't always have to get naked!"" Dunham jokingly replied, according to E!, ""Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He's been making me!""Almost immediately, the actress realized the joke crossed a line and she deleted the post and apologized.“I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys.

But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.”One user noted that Duham isn’t usually one to stay quiet during similar controversies.“I really don't think you'd be cutting anyone else any slack if they made that joke and then blamed it on being 'really sleepy,'” the user commented.Dunham replied that the joke would have been worse coming from a man.“Not if they were a fifty year old man.

899	Lena Dunham’s Saturday Night Live had something for everyone — even her 94-year-old grandmother. There was pixilated nudity, Bible stories, Jon Hamm and Liam Neeson cameos, an obnoxious GPS that didn’t like Dunham’s singing voice, and Liza Minnelli impressions. At the end, Dunham said she wanted to french-kiss the audience, a Benigni-esque declaration of emotion that I don’t doubt for a moment. (After all, her granny was practically a third-base coach back in the day.)The Girls star wasn’t fazed in the slightest by hosting the show, which isn’t much of a surprise — Dunham doesn’t seem like a shrinking violet. Even skits that didn’t completely work belonged to her. That is, she came with a plan, and/or the writers recognized and appreciated her voice and sense of humor and made an effort to use them. Hit or miss, I so prefer this type of Saturday Night Live sketch to the ones that have little or nothing to do with the host.Since Dunham’s fame is still rather polarizing, it will be interesting to see how she fares in our best-host poll. Jimmy Fallon might be invincible, but his biggest challenger is shaping up to be a surprise. Jim Parsons debuted in second place with a shaky 22.9 percent of the vote, but it’s Josh Hutcherson, who finished a close third, who is becoming Fallon’s biggest threat. His support nearly doubled, and there seems to be a bloc of voters determined to win him the prize. Melissa McCarthy, who still might rally to chase Fallon, finished a strong fourth, but she’s in danger now of following Drake off the elimination plank.A quick rundown on our objective: To identify the season’s funniest, most memorable SNL host, the person who best fit in with the cast and put on a performance that you, your mom, and your co-worker were all chuckling about on Monday. It’s subjective, of course, but let’s reward the guest hosts who brought something special to the table. My own personal bottom line: Do you want to see this host back on the show next season?So far, Bruce Willis, Miley Cyrus, Edward Norton, Lady Gaga, Tina Fey (Blerg), John Goodman, Paul Rudd, Kerry Washington, Jonah Hill, and Drake have been eliminated.Below, I’ve embedded one representative clip for each of the five hosts currently in the race. After the poll closes, the host with the least support will be eliminated, and the surviving four will face off against Louis C.K. on March 29.Watch the clips, refresh your memories, and vote.Josh HutchersonJimmy FallonMelissa McCarthyJim ParsonsLena Dunham	Entertainment

A woman was found dead in the Mexican ambassador's mansion but my gut tells me he did not kill her so we need to handle this fast,"" she says at breakneck speed that puts even Ms Washinton to shame.""Harrison, break into the CIA and find out who would want to frame him. Quinn, Huck, hack into the NSA and get the surveillance footage.""Abby, burn down the crime scene and make it look like an electrical fire and I need someone to plant a bug on the ambassador's wife, Kelsey (Dunham) why don't you do that?""So far so Scandal, but then comes to avalanche of funny with Dunham asking everything everyone wants to know, beginning with: ""Erm. OK. I mean I'll totally go but you just talked so fast that I have literally a thousand follow-up questions.""Then she asks them and there's even a much needed reality check that the real Olivia Pope could use when it comes to her boyfriend troubles.To see that and get a huge laugh, check out the achingly funny sketch below.Did you know we have a TV & film page on Facebook?

902	"Yes, yes, internet, Lena Dunham hosted SNL this week, and she brought along some pixilated nudity and a few special guest stars, as if the internet wasn’t already on the verge of melting down about it.This article is from the archive of our partner .Yes, yes, internet, Lena Dunham hosted SNL this week, and she brought along some pixilated nudity and a few special guest stars, as if the internet wasn’t already on the verge of melting down about it. Put it this way: last week we had Jim Parsons, star of one of the most-watched, least-discussed shows in America. This time we had Lena, of whom you could say the opposite.Perhaps unsurprisingly, given everything she’s done on Girls, Lena was totally game for the hosting gig and acquitted herself very nicely, using a perfunctory monologue bit to get the whole “I’m naked all the time!” gag out of the way quickly (or so we thought, but more on that in a bit). After last week’s lackluster affair, the show hit a far more consistent stride here. The only dud was the confusing “Jewelry Party,” which initially seemed to be about a men’s rights activist (Mike O’Brien) and his fiery Venezuelan girlfriend (Cecily Strong, who maybe needs to stop doing that accent), but then morphed into being about Cecily dumping Mike (remember, they’re a real-life couple!) because of his noodle arms. It wasn’t even mirthless, it just felt half-baked. But it’s always good to see O’Brien getting more work on the show. He plays an excellent secret weirdo.Bobby Moynihan was not a big presence this week but he was the secret MVP of talk show “What Are You Even Doing? You’re Being Crazy,” a showcase for another outstanding excitable teen played by Nasim Pedrad. There’s Bobby in the background, typecast as a lazy stoned college student playing video games, but when the moment comes for everyone to flirt with the camera, he blows it away. Jon Hamm (please come back and host for real, sir!) was in this sketch and he wasn’t the hottest part about it.Sasheer Zamata, who’s been ever-present since getting cast on the show but hasn’t had much to say, also got a big lead role in a fantastic Scandal spoof, long-overdue on SNL. Until Zamata was cast, this would basically have been impossible to stage without giving Maya Rudolph an embarrassed call. Zamata’s best moment was her spot-on mimicry of Kerry Washington’s scandalized head-shaking any time Fitz lays a hand on her. But it should be noted, this sketch basically belonged to Dunham, whose wide-eyed idolatry of the gladiators was probably just a step away from her reaction as a viewer.But who was the MVP this week?The Scandal sketch was probably Lena Dunham’s biggest of the night, but she was a very reliable part of this week’s ensemble, only busting out one impression (a thankfully brief Liza Minnelli) but anchoring several others, including the requisite “Lena Dunham gets naked, OMG!” bit, which was thankfully contextualized as a take on Adam (Driver) and Eve. Considering Dunham has never done this kind of live comedy work before, she gets major points for coming off like a pro, even handling a flubbed line in the “Jewelry Party” sketch gracefully.But her best work was in the pre-taped sketch “Ooh Child,” where her attempts at singing along with her friends in the car just kept getting interrupted by the GPS lady, more and more, to the point of implausibility. This was also just a standout sketch of the night, a winner mostly because of its sick little stinger, just as you’re getting bored with the original premise of the sketch. To say more would be spoiling things!The knock on Jay Pharaoh's Obama impression has always been that the writing doesn't support the quality of his work. It's spot-on, but Obama leaves almost no wiggle room for funny business. So thank God last night that Pharaoh finally broke through, thanks to an assist from Vladimir Putin and an unexpected Liam Neeson cameo. Neesan delivers hisTaken speech to Vladimir Putin but acknowledges he can't really kick ass like his movie character. But he does know Hollywood producers, so he introduces a Powerthirst-ian video of Obama posing topless on a horse, smashing rocks with a sledgehammer, showing off his vicious Tiger Claw judo, armwrestling bikers and knocking out a bear with his bare hands. ""That's how we get down in the Chi-town, baby."" It's the loosest Obama we've seen yet, and the payoff is so great. Later Pharoah rekindled his excellent Katt Williams impression, which was briefly hijacked by Drake, to hang out with the prettiest man we've ever seen, Jared Leto. (Let's not talk about Lena's Liza.)You generally don't think of Taran Killam as an impressionist—he certainly doesn't fill the void left by Bill Hader (though that void is being filled quite nicely by Kate McKinnon, not that you could tell from this week's episode)—but he busted out two of his strongest ones this week. We've seen him do Adam Driver before, so watching him in the Garden of Eden gave us another chance to watch Killam inhabit odd Driver quirks like his barrel-chested posture, hair-flipping, and outburst-y delivery. The real revelation, however, was his Matthew McConaughey impersonation on Weekend Update, which was scarily accurate. Part-True Detective riff, part-Oscar speech send-up, Killam nailed McConaughey's spacey self-regard, and it's going to be hard not to refer to Colin Jost as Co-Jo from now on. This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.
    From the Mayan ballgame Pitz to ancient Greece’s bull-leaping, here’s a tour of the history of athletic games.
In the mid-1930s, the Federal Writers’ Project interviewed thousands of former slaves, some of whom claimed the president came to their plantations disguised as a beggar or a peddler, telling them they’d soon be free.Shortly before the election of 1860, a man came upon a plantation near Marlin, Texas, some 20 miles southeast of Waco. Though nobody knew who he was, the plantation owner took him in as a guest. The stranger paid close attention to how the enslaved people working on the plantation were treated—how they subsisted on a weekly ration of “four pounds of meat and a peck of meal,” how they were whipped and sometimes sold, resulting in the tearing apart of families. Eventually, the stranger said goodbye and went on his way, but a little while later he wrote a letter to the plantation owner, informing him he would soon have to free his slaves—“that everybody was going to have to, that the North was going to see to it.” The stranger told the owner to go into the room where he’d slept, and see where he’d carved his name into the headrest. And when the slaveholder went and looked, he saw the name: “A. Lincoln.”Lawmakers scoffed at the president’s calls to slash funding across the government a year ago. With a new spending deal now in place, they’re likely to do so again.Within the thousands of pages the White House transmitted to Congress on Monday morning as part of President Trump’s second annual budget request, there is a line that pretty much sums up the whole ritual.“Many of the eliminations and reductions in this volume reflect a continuation of policies proposed in the 2018 President’s Budget that have not yet been enacted
by the Congress,” the sentence reads. It’s included in the introduction of a 222-page document titled “Major Savings and Reforms.”Those are all the cuts the Trump administration is proposing, and they’re going nowhere.Trump again wants to take a meat cleaver to the Environmental Protection Agency, chopping its budget by one-third. He’s asking Congress to scrap entirely community-development block grants and heating assistance for low-income housing. And he wants to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the national endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, and a slew of other independent agencies.The fumbling of domestic-violence accusations against Rob Porter is a story about the administration’s inability to tell the truth, not its disorganization.The White House’s response to allegations of domestic violence against former Staff Secretary Rob Porter has so stunned reporters that the whole episode has become an exemplar of the total disorganization of the Trump administration.“Abuse Case Exposes Fissures in a White House in Turmoil,” The New York Times intones. Axios’s Jonathan Swan writes, “This is crazy. Even in a White House that’s famous for chaos, I’ve never seen anything like this.” Politico’s Playbook simply announced, “CHAOS at 1600 Pennsylvania.”This is peculiar, not only because it is difficult to imagine what would rise to the level of notable chaos relative to the standards of this White House. It’s strange because the focus on disorder has overshadowed the more salient feature of the moment: Insofar as the administration is engulfed in chaos, it is a result of its inability to tell the truth. The Trump team doesn’t have a chaos problem so much as it has a dishonesty problem. Of course this is not new, either—in fact, the serial dissembling of the White House has become so banal that it goes almost unremarked in this case—yet it is on particularly dramatic display here.Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald rose to the occasion with their paintings of the former president and first lady, while—importantly—continuing their radical projects in black portraiture.Jasmine, African blue lilies, and Chicago’s favorite flower, chrysanthemum, flourish in the botanical backdrop of President Barack Obama’s official portrait. The 44th president appears seated in an ornate chair, with leafy vines threatening to climb up his pant leg.In her official portrait, First Lady Michelle Obama appears seated, too, in a flowing dress designed by Milly. Between her gown, with its touches of geometric patterning, and the sky-blue paint that frames her figure, the painting features a lot of hard-edged abstraction.On Monday, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled the Obamas’ official portraits. President Obama’s portrait, by the Los Angeles–born and New York–based artist Kehinde Wiley, will join the museum’s hall of American presidents, where it will permanently disrupt the march of white presidential paintings. The portrait of Michelle Obama, the work of Baltimore’s Amy Sherald, will be on view with recent acquisitions through November 2018.From Donald Trump to recent op-eds, the male perspective remains—stubbornly, perniciously—the default point of view.The tweet, as so often happens, was at once shocking and deeply predictable.Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused—life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?That was President Trump, on Saturday, ostensibly reacting to the fact that, this week, allegations of domestic abuse led to the resignations of two high-level staffers at the White House. He was also, obliquely, weighing in on #MeToo. The president’s 48-word assessment of the reckoning so many Americans are painfully but productively engaged in made for rich (but thoroughly unsurprising) irony: Trump, of course, has been accused of sexual impropriety by 19 women—and has also been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault, and has also boasted, on national television, about advising friends to “be rougher” toward their wives, and has also been elected president of the United States. His tweet is revealing both in spite and because of those facts: “Peoples[sic],” in the plural; allegation, in the singular. The peoples meaning the “men’s”; the allegation—though in its context, the diminishing adjective is redundant—being a “mere” one.Digital stardust won’t magically make future cities more affordable or resilient.The term “smart city” is interesting yet not important, because nobody defines it. “Smart” is a snazzy political label used by a modern alliance of leftist urbanites and tech industrialists. To deem yourself “smart” is to make the NIMBYites and market-force people look stupid.Smart-city devotees all over this world will agree that London is particularly smart. Why? London is a huge, ungainly beast whose cartwheeling urban life is in cranky, irrational disarray. London is a god-awful urban mess, but London does have some of the best international smart-city conferences.London also has a large urban-management bureaucracy who emit the proper smart-city buzzwords and have even invented some themselves.  The language of Smart City is always Global Business English, no matter what town you're in.The president’s budget proposal has some troubling news for the space agency’s next big astronomy mission.The Trump administration has released its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 and put dozens of federal programs on the chopping block, including a brand-new NASA space telescope that scientists say would provide the biggest picture of the universe yet, with the same sparkling clarity as the Hubble Space Telescope.The proposal, released Monday, recommends eliminating the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), citing “higher priorities” at NASA and the cost of the new telescope.“Given competing priorities at NASA, and budget constraints, developing another large space telescope immediately after completing the $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope is not a priority for the administration,” the proposal states. “The budget proposes to terminate WFIRST and redirect existing funds to other priorities of the science community, including completed astrophysics missions and research.”Images of Carnival season 2018, already underway, with celebrations in Brazil, Portugal, Hungary, Bolivia, Haiti, Spain, Italy, and more.Carnival season 2018 is underway across Europe and the Americas. These pre-Lent festivals, often a blend of local pagan and Catholic traditions, usher out winter and welcome in spring. The largest and most famous—the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil—took place over the past few days.  Gathered here are images of Carnivals around the world, including images from Brazil, Portugal, Hungary, Bolivia, Haiti, Spain, Italy, and more. Depending on available photos, there may be a follow-up post later this week with more from Mardi Gras and other celebrations.The surprise release of The Cloverfield Paradox, along with acquisitions of other schlocky genre movies, suggests the company is leaning in to its “direct-to-video” approach.Just a year ago, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Netflix was a big player. The streaming company was a little more than a year into releasing its own original movies for its subscribers, and it was looking for prestige hits to gain a foothold as a distributor Hollywood could take seriously. It acquired one of the best-reviewed films of the festival, Mudbound, for $12.5 million, and the Grand Jury Prize winner I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, among others. In terms of prestige, Netflix was lagging behind its competitor Amazon, which had nabbed a Best Picture nomination for its major Sundance acquisition of 2016, Manchester by the Sea. Maybe Netflix’s new slate of indie favorites would turn things around.Republican lawmakers are increasingly showing disdain for decisions made by the judicial branch—and by extension the rule of law.An old legal anecdote—attributed to such legal notables as Mae West and the Earl of Birkenhead—depicts a frustrated judge asking an obstreperous lawyer, “Are you displaying contempt of court?”“No, your honor,” the advocate responds. “I am trying to conceal it.”I sometimes think simple politeness—a willingness to conceal contempt for other parties, judges, and even law itself—is all that differentiates true lawyers from thugs in contrast-collar shirts. But like other areas of public etiquette, this habitual courtesy is showing strain in the era of Donald Trump.Trump likes to denounce and threaten courts that thwart his will. But the political threat to courts did not begin with Trump and will not end when he is gone. It is part of a civic rot that is eating at the vitals of our democracy, and it is getting worse.In a StoryCorps animation, Patrick Haggerty remembers the remarkable advice he got from his dairy farmer dad.Lucius Zafalon is a daredevil motorcycle rider who risks his body in the pursuit of the perfect Globe of Death act.It’s an incredible story.

	On Friday Antonoff, 29, posted a flashback photo of him and Dunham, 27, sandwiched in between the President and First Lady from an apparent visit to the White House.
	It may have been a snapshot from last summer, as E! News points out, but the fun. guitarist posted the shot ahead of his girlfriend's big ""Saturday Night Live"" debut.

907	“Son of God,” “Noah,” and now “Girls” — 2014 is the year of the Bible movie.Lena Dunham nailed her ‘Saturday Night Live’ hosting debut with a parody of her hit HBO series, proving that the travails and tribulations of the average twentish-year-old woman are as old as time itself. “Girls: The Bible Movie” trades in the coffeeshops of Greenpoint for the Garden of Eden, with Adam Driver and Dunham’s character Hannah Horvath as Adam and Eve.And just like in “Girls,” everyone’s naked.How do unlabeled relationships fare in a land of talking snakes and forbidden fruit?

908	So, how did Lena Dunham do in her inaugural episode of Saturday Night Live? It depends who you’re asking.Those who are generally into Dunham’s work were probably amused on the whole, even if they also wished Lena had broken out of her comfort zone a little more. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dunham played a bunch of girls — immature, fast-talking, hyperbole-happy variations on her HBO persona — and one serviceable Liza Minnelli.) But if you’re one of those people who can’t stand cable’s wunderkind — here I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume that dislike has nothing to do with Dunham’s looks — your feelings likely weren’t swayed by Lena’s SNL performance, since it hewed so closely to what she does weekly on Girls.Since I’m in the former camp, I’ll give the episode a tempered thumbs up. While SNL‘s writers’ room is clearly still suffering from growing pains in the wake of Seth Meyers’s exit — someone has to, like, remind them that sketches are supposed to have jokes — last night’s show was, pound for pound, stronger than March 1’s Jim Parsons Experience. And it packed in a few  solid laughs, particularly in the night’s…Best SketchScandal can be surprisingly tough to parody — maybe because at this point, it’s basically a parody of itself. (Take, for example, Jimmy Kimmel’s Escandalo: hilarious, but barely more ridiculous than the thing it’s sending up.) Still, SNL managed to spoof TV’s most delightfully over-the-top series with a premise that felt both straightforward and clever: stick in a regular person newly recruited to be a Gladiator (Dunham, naturally), and simply have her react to everything that’s going on around her (“You talk so fast, and I have literally a thousand followup questions”). And while Sasheer Zamata’s Kerry Washington impression could use some work, the way she helplessly opened her mouth as Taran Killam’s President Fitz sensually stroked her face was pure gold. She is not a prize at the State Fair!!Honorable MentionIt may not have skewered Dunham’s show as excellently as Blerta’s entrée into Girls, but “Biblical Movie” — which proposed a version of Adam and Eve starring Dunham as the world’s very first girl — packed in some of the night’s best one-liners. “I’m three days old! I don’t even have health insurance!”Worst SketchCameo CornerBest Musical MomentMy roommate, who is much cooler than me, says that “Graceless” was kind of a strange choice for The National’s SNL debut. I’ll take her word for it and add that the band seemed sort of low-energy, at least until they started rocking out in the second half of the song — but either way, this was better than their snoozier second performance.The WTF AwardIs someone on SNL‘s writing staff a charter member of the Katt Williams fan club? That’s the only possible excuse for designing an entire sketch around a guy who hasn’t been pop culturally relevant in years — mere weeks after Drake did his own Williams impression during his SNL debut. Although I guess I shouldn’t be too hard on this bit, since it did give us the gift of Taran Killam’s growly Harrison Ford.Best Evidence that SNL Should Retire Fake Talk Show SketchesCast MVPTaran Killam was everywhere tonight, expertly impersonating everyone from Fitz and Ford to Adam Driver. But even if he hadn’t appeared in so many sketches, he’d still win this award for his spookily accurate Matthew McConaughey. In a perfect world, Killam’s take on the philosophical Oscar winner would be Update’s new Nicolas Cage. After all, they’re about equally likely to have sex with the Declaration of Independence.Extras– Someone needs to send out a search party for poor John Milhiser.– I wasn’t totally on board with “Ooh Child” — an amusing pre-tape with a weirdly dark twist — but I do appreciate the effort.– Two highlights from Dunham’s monologue, brought to you by Bobby Moynihan: “I’m just asking: Is this the right number of these? I feel like I have too many. Or maybe too few;” and Kate McKinnon: “In the 1940s, only cool girls went to third base. And I was cool as hell.”– Sorry, “What Are You Even Doing” — you can try as hard as you want, but you’ll never be “Wake Up Wakefield.” Also: Those girls could use some help from flirting expert Rebecca LaRue.– This week in “Huh, Okay Then, Good Neighbor“: “Isn’t it funny to repeat the word ’email’?”– Weekend Update Watch: Colin Jost, unsurprisingly, is still finding his footing. But Cecily Strong’s gotten pretty comfortable in her seat, which really helps her jokes land — especially that line about badass Pope Francis.– True or false: Jay Pharoah and Drake wore the exact same Katt Williams wig.– Dunham, bidding her goodbyes: “I wanna French kiss all of you!”	Entertainment
909	"The actress stripped down for a hilarious spoof of her hit TV showLena Dunham is completely fearless when it comes to two things: being naked on camera and poking fun at herself. So it makes sense that the Girls creator and star would do both while hosting US comedy show Saturday Night Live this weekend.In the show’s most talked-about sketch, the actress stars in a dramatic trailer for the next big biblical film, Girl, which features ‘Lena Dunham’s unique take on the life of Eve as a struggling 20-something in the Garden of Eden.’The camera pans through a lush forest and lands on Lena wearing – guessed it – nothing.‘Adam? This snake just talked to me,’ she says, mocking her neurotic Girls character, Hannah Horvath

The Girls star, who regularly strips off in scenes for her hit TV series, appeared on Saturday Night Live over the weekend, and mocked her penchant for nudity by shedding her clothes in a skit about biblical figures Adam and Eve.

The sketch irked some viewers, with one taking to Twitter to tell the actress, ""You don't always have to get naked"", to which Dunham quipped: ""Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He's been making me!""

The star later deleted the post and apologized for the remark, writing, ""I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy.

Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.’Lena made the joke after fan pointed out after the show aired: ‘You don’t always have to get naked.’She hit back: ‘Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He’s been making me!’In the sketch, Lena plays Eve while Taran Killam stars as Adam and Vanessa Bayer takes the role of the snake.Before eating the forbidden fruit, she asks God: ‘Can you please not apple shame me right now?’‘Seriously, I know I committed original sin, but at least it’s original. I think I deserve some credit for that. Or at least a publishing deal.’MORE: Lena Dunham on Girls sex scenes: You have to know each person’s limits

914	"Taylor Swift and Lena Dunham got in on the Mean Girls reunion madness when they met up with Daniel Franzese (aka, Damian) and Rajiv Surendra (aka, Kevin Gnapoor) at the Saturday Night Live afterparty in NYC in the wee hours of Sunday morning. Lena was fresh off her hosting duties for the show, where she had comedy hits with her Girls parody of the Biblical story of Adam of Eve and a Scandal skit, where she showed what it would be like if a normal person was on the show.One person who wasn't present at the SNL bash was Lorde, who was probably too busy preparing for her slate of shows in the Big Apple to hit up a late-night party. However, Lorde and Taylor did fit in a bit of fun earlier in the weekend when they took silly photos in a city park.  Be sure to check out our update on the Mean Girls cast, including Rajiv's surprising new career, as they all prepare for the 10th anniversary of the movie's release this April.Source: Instagram user whatsupdanny

915	by John Nolte10 Mar 20140After a full week of traveling — three days in DC and four in Kentucky — you would think that the last thing I would have known about is who hosted “Saturday Night Live” last Saturday night. But the hype was such that even though I was in a travel bubble, I knew it was “Girls” star Lena Dunham. All that hype and the show still tanked. Dunham’s “SNL” appearance delivered the second lowest ratings of the year. Dunham may be “hot” with everyone who knows Maureen Dowd or with those who know someone who knows Maureen Dowd, but outside of that tight little obnoxious circle, no one likes her. And it is not as though no one has heard of Lena Dunham. She is being force fed to us via every lever of popular culture in the free world. Dunham has been rejected by the public. One of the Left’s greatest weapons is fabricating a reality that does not exist.  2. Harvey Weinstein is a Welfare QueenWhat isn’t there to hate about a Left that openly attacks tax cuts and openly calls for tax increases, but at the same time openly calls for tax incentives for their rich selves. And the media lets them get away with it. Overrated producer Harvey Weinstein is advocating for $400 million in California film tax incentives using the argument that lower taxes attracts industry and therefore jobs. Well, no shit. But it is just not HOLLYWOOD jobs. That formula works for all jobs. I am unaware of anyone in the entertainment or mainstream media that has challenged even one of these left-wing Hollywood welfare queens on this point.  3. Bill ‘Wild Bill’ Guarnere, of ‘Band of Brothers’ fame, dies at 90Here is the Fox News story. Frank John Hughes, who so memorably portrayed ‘Wild Bill’ in the HBO miniseries “Band of Brothers” tweeted his own tribute: I’ve lost my hero and my friend. Knowing him made me a better man and playing him was the greatest honor of my life. pic.twitter.com/8lvLzsUhaz— Frank John Hughes (@frankjhughes) March 9, 2014—It really is time to watch “Band of Brothers” again.  4. Why Hollywood Puts Up with Charlie SheenThe Hollywood Reporter claims that “Anger Management” star Charlie Sheen is reverting back to the behavior that cost him his lucrative “Two and a Half Men” gig. If you are wondering why FX would pick Sheen up after his CBS implosion:There is much riding on Sheen’s continued involvement in Anger, which is poised to generate between $350 million to $500 million in revenue if it completes its 100 episode order. If it ends up running for 150 episodes, that range could grow to as much as $800 million, say sources, once network license fees, international sales and syndication revenue are included. (The series, thanks to the global recognition of Sheen, is expected to generate close to $1 million an episode overseas.)“Anger Management” isn’t even a hit. It is all about feeding the bundled cable monster. Man alive, what a racket. Billions made from television shows no one watches just because over 100 million Americans are dumb enough to pay for dozens of channels they never watch.  5. ‘Noah’ Banned in Several Middle Eastern CountriesChristians might argue against a film and then choose not to go. Some might even attempt a boycott. Muslim countries outright ban the sucker. Still, Hollywood aims all its hostility at Christians.  Quick HitsJack Is Back May 24–Wes Anderson: The New Woody Allen?Academy Members Voted for ’12 Years a Slave’ Without Seeing It‘The Walking Dead’s’ ‘Lost’ SeasonFor The 10th Anniversary Of ‘Deadwood,’ HBO Will Air All 36 Episodes  Send tips, requests to jnolte@breitbart.comFollow  John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC               Big Hollywood, HBO, Lena Dunham, TwitterComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

919	"FOLLOW:
            Or, at least, <em>a</em> host of her generation.
          Yesterday afternoon, Joan Rivers tweeted that Lena Dunham's SNL-hosting debut might mark the first time the writer-director appeared onscreen with her clothes on. (Still got it, Joan!) The legendary comedian may have missed the point, though. Dunham's proclivity for nudity on Girls, the TV show she created, is certainly notable, and it did not escape the attention of SNL's writers. (In multiple sketches, nonetheless.) What's far more interesting, however, is that at age 24, Dunham created a TV show, and is either the voice of her generation, the person most closely associated with it, or a harbinger of the fact that everyone from her generation comprises the voice of that generation. In any case, this second aspect is what last night's episode focused on, mostly to positive effect. All that was missing was Tina Fey's Albanian Girls character, Blerta, who sadly did not make an appearance.Cameo That Was Sadly Not Tina Fey of the WeekSometimes movie stars show up on SNL to briefly promote their films without any justification for their presence beyond a coinciding release date. Fortunately for everybody involved, including us viewers, not only does Liam Neeson have a movie in theaters now, but he is also the symbolic hero America wants in a time of Ukrainian crisis. Rather than feeling shoehorned in, like the De Niro/Stallone double-teaming in John Goodman's episode last December, Neeson's cameo in the presidential-address cold open felt as welcome as a clotheslined windpipe in a Liam Neeson movie. Also, welcome: Jay Pharoah's President Obama slapping a bear.Third Base Coach of the WeekIt would be wrong to say that Dunham's episode gets the nudity issue out of the way in the monologue, since it does indeed come up again later, but it is initially addressed here. Our host's habit of disrobing is turned into an invitation for everyone else to approach her with their sex stuff, including a parade of frisky cast members, most notably Kate McKinnon as Dunham's grandmother. ""In the 1940s only cool girls went to third base, and I was cool as hell,"" McKinnon says, adding that she was practically a third base coach. With sex stuff adequately addressed, the show is now officially underway.Inevitable Robot Uprising of the WeekSometimes it just feels like technology is out to get you personally and oh my god why is it doing this right now. Whether it's the lack of reception in a time of urgency, or catastrophic autocorrect, we've all borne the brunt of a digital vendetta. In this pretaped sketch, Dunham's character is constantly interrupted mid-sing-along by GPS directions while everybody else on the road trip gets their American Idol on, unimpeded. It's a fun look at how trying to explain a uniquely annoying moment never seems to help you get out of that moment, albeit one with a bizarre twist ending kind of tacked on.Millennial Mockery of the WeekThanks to certain staffing changes of late, SNL can now effectively parody high-stakes, prime-time soap opera Scandal without the participation of Kerry Washington. This sketch is only a spoof of that show on the surface, however, and it's mostly a vehicle for Dunham to portray one of the less capable members of the generation that she is maybe the voice of. As the hapless Kelsey, Dunham is confounded by the fierce hyper-competency of Sasheer Zamata's Olivia Pope, and the writers use her to make a few digs at both millennials and some of the more implausible aspects of Scandal. (""You walk faster than I run even though you are always dressed for a formal wedding,"" Kelsey says of Olivia, accurately.)Example of Great Rap of the WeekThe safest way for SNL to do racial humor is making white people the butt of the joke, and nobody's complaining. This week, the show introduces Pharoah and Kenan Thompson as Lil Taint Anthony and LeGod Williams, hosts of the MTV2 show ""What's Poppin'."" Before we get to an admittedly rock-solid entry in the ""white people are lame"" canon of hip-hop sketches, Zamata is briefly pictured on an album cover as N'Kaysha Gniles, purveyor of a song so dirty it's just one long censored bleep. (Fun fact: I would gladly watch a video of that song.) That's a Rap is like the bizarro world Roots — a hip-hop band that is entirely wrong.The music sounds like elevator jazz and the rapping is just sing-songy slam poetry about the fact that rappers Dunham, Cecily Strong, and a flute-playing Aidy Bryant are in fact rapping. The wordplay is the best possible outcome of what you might hear in a university coffee shop, so in other words, it's terrible, but amusingly so. But aside from the fact that Mike O'Brien plays a character named Jerry whose rap name is ""Tim,"" the best joke here might be the wardrobe, which was pilfered, it seems, from a Spin Doctors garage sale in 1994. As the members of That's a Rap would say: Choo-choo, sha-booch!Forbidden Fruit of the WeekThe frequent nudity on Dunham's HBO show rises to the forefront again, this time in a parody of recent religious movies like Son of God and the forthcoming Noah. Girl is a Girls-style Adam and Eve movie, featuring Taran Killam as Adam Driver as Adam. It has a lot of biblical jokes with a Hannah Horvath twist, but those almost seem beside the point, which, again, is Lena Dunham is frequently naked! Frankly, while I'm not sick of the filmmaker's naked body, I've probably had my fill of parodies involving the strategic blurring of her naked body.Middle-School Mayhem of the Week""What Are You Even Doing? You're Being Crazy"" occupies the very same territory as the recurring ""Girlfriends"" sketch. They both feature young girls hosting a talk show for some reason, and acting mystified by their male guests. The difference is that the ""Girlfriends"" sketches are character-driven, and this one kinda sags under the weight of its title and the middle school girl vernacular that seems to be its main focus. Bobby Moynihan gets in some decent moments, though, as the older brother who's over it, and there's a surprising cameo from Josh Hamm (the artist formerly known as Jon Hamm.)Oscar-Worthy Performance of the WeekIn his second on-camera turn as ""Weekend Update"" co-anchor, Colin Jost is settling into his role nicely. Of course, he is upstaged by his guests who are uniformly great. First up, there's Taran Killam as Matthew McConaughey. Wearing the newly minted Best Actor's white tux from the Oscars, Killam internalizes all of McConaughey's mannerisms from hand gestures to that slow drawl. Best of all, though, is his sure-to-stick nickname for Colin Jost: CoJo.After two famous actors already made cameos on the episode, Fred Armisen drops in for ""Weekend Update"" to reprise his ""world leader's best friends growing up"" character alongside Vanessa Bayer. This time, the leader in question is Putin instead of Ahmadinejad, but the soto voce gossiping works as well as ever. Considering that Armisen is now band leader over at the neighboring Late Night With Seth Meyers, we'll probably be seeing him back more often.Justice Moment of the WeekYesterday was International Women's Day and what better way to celebrate than sticking it to a men's rights activist? Here, Cecily Strong's Marisol is a walking Latina stereotype in the vein of Sofia Vergara on Modern Family or Salma Hayek in life. She's brought her boyfriend Bruce to a jewelry party, and everybody turns on him the moment it emerges that he's a men's rights activist. As they should — men's rights activists are the worst. This sketch is perhaps most notable, however, for the rather graceful way Lena Dunham recovers from a flubbed line.Double-Dipping Pimping of the WeekTalk show sketch ""Pimpin' Pimpin' Pimpin'"" is the second caricature of Katt Williams on SNL this year, and to those unfamiliar with the comedian, it must be hard to believe Williams is a real person and not a creation of the show. His whole pimp-emulating shtick has not exactly aged well, and it's amazing that Jay Pharoah is not at all exaggerating in his representation of it. The novelty of Drake's impersonation was amusing enough to justify its inclusion in January, but why another sketch so soon? No disrespect to the comedian or his fans, but how relevant is Katt Williams in the pop-culture landscape right now? Not so forgotten as to be a weird reference point, but certainly not hot enough to demand multiple SNL send-ups. Please tell me how I'm wrong and a jerk in the comments below.In Conversation: Quincy JonesAmerica Is Great, But Olympic Skater Adam Rippon Just Wants to Make Reese Witherspoon ProudBarack and Michelle Obama’s Official Portraits Are RevealedWhat’s New on Netflix: February 2018Every Episode of Black Mirror, Ranked From Worst to BestSee what’s new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBOHomeland Season-Premiere Recap: Welcome to the ResistanceThe Obamas’ Official Portraits Rise to the OccasionAdam Rippon Has Nothing to Say to Mike Pence, Which Is a Shame, Because Everything He Says Is GoldKim Cattrall Does Not Want ‘Hypocrite’ Sarah Jessica Parker’s Condolences at This TimeWhat Made Mirai Nagasu’s Triple Axel So IncredibleLike many internet trends, it was heavy on aesthetics and light on substance.Ruffin, the host of the Writers Guild of America East awards, slammed the Real Time comic.The Netflix series is being adapted from the graphic novel and comic by Gerard Way.Why rise to the No. 1 spot when you can just buy it?This show could be one of the all-time Star Trek greats.Zac Efron, please take a shower.A former neighbor had accused the singer of groping her at his home in 2016.They join stars Andrew Rannells and Don Cheadle.And it shows no signs of slowing down.Starting March 31.Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald join the canon.Whether for inspiration, fitspiration, or thirst.“You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV.”… some of these five come-from-behind conditions are met.Director Tom Tykwer on the dance clubs, flapper girls, and political violence in his new Netflix show.Parents have complained about a scene where Peter Rabbit uses a slingshot to force-feed a blackberry to a farmer who is allergic to the fruit.Is Reileen the true mastermind of Altered Carbon?Painted by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald.Everyone from Kristi Yamaguchi to Reese Witherspoon reacted. “Reese has been a wonderful support system in teaching me the ways of modernity,” Portman said.© 2018, New York Media LLC.

Lena Dunham has apologised for making a joke about molestation.
The outspoken Girls actress appeared on Saturday Night Live over the weekend and shocked some viewers when she stripped off on screen.She's come under fire for the nudity in her HBO show before and was again targeted on Twitter by people who thought the flesh-baring was too much.When one Twitter user advised her she ""doesn't always have to get naked"", the star responded with: ""Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He's been making me! (sic)""Realising she may have gone too far, the 27-year-old deleted the post and apologised to her followers.""I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy,"" she confessed.""SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.""But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend. (sic)""Despite Lena's apology, some fans still felt shocked by her comment.One suggested she wouldn't cut anyone else any ""slack"" if they posted a similar message and then blamed it on being tired.""Not if they were a fifty year old man. But by my lights women can have a lot of joke flexibility. Ya gotta get by in this world (sic),"" she replied.Girls is currently in its third season and has a new face in the form of British actress Felicity Jones on board.Lena was pleased to have the chance to welcome the 30-year-old into the cast.""We were incredibly honored that Felicity Jones came to play on Girls. She is one of the best actors working today, and what a face! (sic)"" Lena gushed.

927	 Saturday Night Live has already produced some pretty excellent Girls parodies, but this week, they had an advantage: the show’s creator and star Lena Dunham just happened to be hosting SNL for the first time.So, naturally, we were treated to a fresh spoof of the buzzy HBO show, currently in its third season. The parody, simply titled “Girl,” takes Lena Dunham’s character, Hannah, and her boyfriend Adam back to biblical times, imagining how their meandering lives would play out among the forbidden fruit and talking snakes of the Garden of Eden, instead of the coffee shops and warehouse parties of Brooklyn.Turns out, that life would be pretty hilarious.

Lena Dunham celebrated her Saturday Night Live debut with Taylor Swift.
The Girls actress hosted the hit US comedy sketch show for the first time this weekend.And E! News reports Lena partied after the show with Taylor, Girls guest star Jenna Lyons, Mean Girls’ Daniel Franzese and SNL cast members Vanessa Bayer, Bobby Moynihan and Aidy Bryant.The group appeared to be having a great time at Asselina restaurant in downtown Manhattan in snaps uploaded to Daniel’s Instagram account.""Live from New York it's the @nbcsnl after party with @girlshbo star @lenadunham and #meangirls homie #RajivSurendra and me @whatsupdanny!,"" he wrote next to an image of himself with Lena and actor Rajiv Surendra.“Best party ever,” Daniel later captioned a photo of himself with Taylor.Lena sparked controversy during her SNL turn after spoofing the frequent nudity of her Girls character Hannah Horvath in one skit.In the sketch, the Girls episode unfolds in the Garden of Eden, with Lena’s character telling the story of “the first girl” opposite Taran Killam as her boyfriend on the hit show.“Adam, a snake just talked to me. Is that normal?"" she asks him.""I just want to know what we're even doing here. Are we like man and wife or is it this situation where there's, like, all these other girls and I'm going to find out from one of the animals?""The actress didn’t seem fazed by the fuss over the sketch, however. She logged onto Twitter after wrapping the show, gushing: ""Cannot overstate how joyful this experience has been. I have always loved you Saturday Night Live, but now I am IN love with you.""

The most obvious joke is the (digitally obscured) nudity — a staple of Dunham's Girls — but the dialogue actually trumps the visual gags. ""I know I committed original sin,"" Dunham's Eve tells God, ""but at least it's original. I think I deserve some credit for that. Or at least a publishing deal."" Familiarity with Dunham's HBO show and/or the Book of Genesis is helpful but not required. --Peter WeberForget Noah: Lena Dunham gets Biblical (and naked) in SNL's biopic of EveSarah Huckabee Sanders insists Trump 'supports victims of domestic violence' and believes in 'due process'On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders addressed the controversy surrounding Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary accused of domestic violence. Porter resigned last Wednesday after the allegations against him were detailed by his two ex-wives to the Daily Mail and The Intercept. The White House initially defended him against the reports, only to backtrack once The Intercept published graphic photos of one of the women with a black eye — images Porter admitted taking.In the aftermath of the allegations and Porter's departure, President Trump himself reminded reporters Friday that Porter ""says he's innocent."" He also tweeted Saturday that ""lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.""Reading from prepared remarks Monday, Sanders insisted that Trump ""supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone deserves to be treated fairly and with due process."" The press corps was not placated that easily, as ABC News' Cecilia Vega asked why Trump hadn't made any statement supporting the victims. ""Why doesn't the president say exactly what you just said right there?"" Vega asked. Sanders maintained that she was ""relaying"" Trump's words as dictated to her.Vega pressed Sanders, asking, ""Does [Trump] believe Rob Porter's accusers, or are they lying?"" Sanders repeated that ""the president … [takes] domestic violence very seriously"" and is also a firm believer in ""due process."" When Vega pointed out that Sanders hadn't answered her question, Sanders replied, ""I'm not going to go beyond that.""Watch the exchange below. Kelly O'Meara MoralesOn whether Pres.

The bust began after Loaiza was pulled over for a ""minor traffic infraction"" while driving ""a vehicle that police believed was being used to smuggle drugs,"" USA Today explains.In a press release, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Loaiza was arrested as part of an ""ongoing narcotics investigation."" After stopping Loaiza, police searched his vehicle and realized it had ""sophisticated"" modifications that seemed to exist for the purpose of hiding drugs. From there, police were able to obtain a warrant to search his home, where they found more than 40 pounds of suspected drugs worth about $500,000, authorities said.San Diego police said the substance is ""suspected cocaine,"" but the final identification is pending further testing, USA Today reports. Loaiza pitched for various teams in his 14-year MLB career, making more than $40 million as a member of several clubs including the New York Yankees, the Texas Rangers, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was twice named an All-Star. Police are currently holding him on felony charges for possession of heroin and cocaine as well as ""possession and transportation of narcotics for sale,"" ESPN says. His bail is reportedly set at $200,000. Kelly O'Meara MoralesFormer MLB All-Star arrested after police find more than 40 pounds of 'suspected cocaine' at his houseTrump compares rebuilding U.S. infrastructure to building an ice skating rink in Central ParkLife is like a box of chocolates, and rebuilding American infrastructure is akin to erecting an ice skating rink. So claimed President Trump on Monday, speaking to reporters on the heels of his administration's unveiling of its long-delayed and much-hyped infrastructure plan.The 55-page plan calls for a $1.5 trillion investment to improve freeways, bridges, and water resources across the U.S. — just $200 billion of which would come from the federal government. The rest would ostensibly be provided by private or local matches.Speaking to reporters about the wonders of collaboration, Trump compared the task of improving the country's infrastructure to the time he built an ice skating rink in Central Park. ""We're gonna have a lot of great people working. We're gonna also have great companies investing and building, and they'll build for you,"" Trump said, ""because sometimes the states aren't able to [build] like [the federal government] can … or like I used to do it when I did the Wollman Rink.""In the 1980s, Trump helped renovate the Wollman Rink, a process that had been stalled for years before he stepped in. ""They couldn't get it built, and I did it in a few months at a much smaller price,"" he said. Trump said he'd been reminded of the rink ""the other day"" by someone who ""had never forgotten it"" and insisted that the rink's expedited construction ""remains a big deal."" He concluded: ""It's really no different with a roadway ... it's no different with a bridge or tunnel or any of the things we'll be fixing.""To the president's credit, he did indeed finish the construction on the Wollman Rink under budget and quicker than expected. Trump came in ""about $750,000"" under the $3 million budget allotted for the project, The New York Times reported at the time, for a rough total investment of $2,250,000 — or, in other words, significantly less than 1 percent of the budget for Trump's infrastructure plan. Kelly O'Meara MoralesTrump compares rebuilding U.S. infrastructure to building an ice skating rink in Central ParkFor the past 6 months, a former top FBI agent has reportedly been working to verify the Trump dossier for BuzzFeedA former top FBI cybersecurity official has been traveling the world over the past six months in an effort to confirm aspects of the controversial dossier on President Trump for BuzzFeed News, Foreign Policy reports. Anthony Ferrante now works for FTI Consulting, which was reportedly hired by BuzzFeed's lawyers after the publication was sued by Russian billionaire Aleksej Gubarev for libel. ""If it's fact, it's not libel. That's the idea,"" said one person familiar with the decision by BuzzFeed's attorneys.Gubarev is mentioned in the dossier, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, which BuzzFeed published in January 2017. The dossier has come under intense scrutiny due to its role in the FBI's obtaining a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The dossier, which began as Republican opposition research before later being funded by actors connected to Hillary Clinton, alleges a number of Trump campaign associates corresponded or met with Russian officials about dropping sanctions against Moscow if Trump won the election. It additionally alleges that Russia has compromising information on Trump that could be used to blackmail him.""At FTI, Ferrante launched what's now been a months-long stealth effort chasing down documents and conducting interviews on the ground in various countries around the world,"" Foreign Policy reports. ""His team directed BuzzFeed lawyers to subpoena specific data and testimony from dozens of agencies or companies across the country and assembled a cyber ops war room to analyze that data, according to sources familiar with the work.""Ferrante worked at the FBI from 2005 through April 2017, and was involved in the U.S. response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Sheriffs are a ""critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement,"" Sessions said — phrasing that was not included in a transcript of the prepared remarks. He added: ""We must never erode this historic office.""""The office of Sheriff is a critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement.

The phrase ""Anglo-American"" typically refers to Americans of English ethnic heritage, or whose native language is English, who are often white.The Hill explains that the etymology of the word ""sheriff"" can be traced to Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, which is perhaps what the attorney general was referring to. But this isn't the first time Sessions has invoked ""Anglo-American"" values: Vice News' Tess Owen pointed out that only two weeks ago, Sessions referred to late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia as ""one of the best judges in American history, and maybe even the Anglo-American tradition."" Kelly O'Meara MoralesJeff Sessions praises sheriffs as a 'critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement'The military has added thousands of names to the FBI's firearms background check list after the Texas massacreThe military quietly added the names of more than 4,000 dishonorably discharged military personnel to the FBI's background check system after a former Air Force member killed 26 people at a Texas church in November, CNN reports. Devin Patrick Kelley, the 26-year-old shooter, had not been entered into a national database by the Air Force after receiving a bad-conduct discharge for assaulting his wife; if his name had been in the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database, he would have been prohibited from purchasing firearms.After the November attack, the Department of Defense rushed to make sure the FBI's system was up to date. CNN found that the backlog was ""so significant that the FBI's tally of dishonorably discharged former service members has ballooned by 4,284 names in just three months, a 38 percent leap."" In 2015, the number of people blocked from owning firearms due to being dishonorably discharged was around 11,000. After November, that bloomed to where it is today, at 15,597.Still, the database is not perfect, and it only blocks sales through licensed dealers. Purchases from neighbors, for example, do not require a background check, CNN notes. Nevertheless, ""the background check system has blocked over three million illegal attempts to buy guns,"" said the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Avery W. Gardiner.

After her nude scene on ""Girls"" garnered much attention, Lena Dunham again showed up in her birthday suit as she hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" this weekend.
In her opening monologue, Dunham defended her show, saying that ""Every show has its thing. 'Seinfeld' had the puffy shirt. 'Home Improvement' had the neighbor talking over the fence, and we have very graphic sex scenes. That's our thing.""
She also insisted that she loved her job, but the downfall of which is how complete strangers feel comfortable talking about their sex lives with her. She recalled, ""Like the other day a man on the street says, 'Hey Lena, your breasts look just like my sister's.' I had a lot of follow up questions like, 'Why would you know that?' and 'Does your sister have nice breasts?'""

Her SNL skit, on the other hand, is one of ""the first girl,"" in honor of the release of the biblical film ""Noah"", and was also a parody of her own show. In her segment, Dunham appeared completely nude (albeit blurred) as Eve, and the story details the life of a twenty-something-year-old in the Garden of Eden.
According to Rolling Stone, Dunham's sketch characters bore resemblance to her ""Girls"" character, Hannah Horvath, with some feminist critique tossed around during the show. The magazine even reported that ""The Garden of Eden"" premise is a clever excuse to get the actress out in her customary birthday suit.

Her segment started with Dunham appearing nude and calling for her mate, Adam Driver (played by Taran Killam, who spoofs her ""Girls"" boyfriend, Adam).
She then told him, ""Adam, a snake just talked to me. Is that normal?""
She also asked, ""I just want to know what we're even doing here. Are we like man and wife or is it this situation where there's, like, all these other girls and I'm going to find out from one of the animals?""
To which he responded, ""What are you talking about? You're like a part of me, literally. God made you from my rib, kid.""
She also questioned ""God,"" asking him, ""Are you saying that in like a 'I suggest you don't' or in, like, a 'definitely don't' but with a side of, like, 'maybe do?'"" when he condemned her and Adam from eating the apples in the garden.
According to NY Daily, Dunham did well for her first time in hosting the comedy show, however, the skits still left a lot to be desired.

'Seinfeld' had the puffy shirt. 'Home Improvement' had the neighbor talking over the fence, and we have very graphic sex scenes. That's our thing.""She also insisted that she loved her job, but the downfall of which is how complete strangers feel comfortable talking about their sex lives with her. She recalled, ""Like the other day a man on the street says, 'Hey Lena, your breasts look just like my sister's.' I had a lot of follow up questions like, 'Why would you know that?' and 'Does your sister have nice breasts?'""Her SNL skit, on the other hand, is one of ""the first girl,"" in honor of the release of the biblical film ""Noah"", and was also a parody of her own show. In her segment, Dunham appeared completely nude (albeit blurred) as Eve, and the story details the life of a twenty-something-year-old in the Garden of Eden.According to Rolling Stone, Dunham's sketch characters bore resemblance to her ""Girls"" character, Hannah Horvath, with some feminist critique tossed around during the show. The magazine even reported that ""The Garden of Eden"" premise is a clever excuse to get the actress out in her customary birthday suit.Her segment started with Dunham appearing nude and calling for her mate, Adam Driver (played by Taran Killam, who spoofs her ""Girls"" boyfriend, Adam).She then told him, ""Adam, a snake just talked to me. Is that normal?""She also asked, ""I just want to know what we're even doing here. Are we like man and wife or is it this situation where there's, like, all these other girls and I'm going to find out from one of the animals?""To which he responded, ""What are you talking about? You're like a part of me, literally. God made you from my rib, kid.""She also questioned ""God,"" asking him, ""Are you saying that in like a 'I suggest you don't' or in, like, a 'definitely don't' but with a side of, like, 'maybe do?'"" when he condemned her and Adam from eating the apples in the garden.According to NY Daily, Dunham did well for her first time in hosting the comedy show, however, the skits still left a lot to be desired.Check out her SNL Monologue here:

In her opening monologu, the actress made fun of her show's propensity for nudity and the fact that nearly the entire world has seen her sans clothes: ""There's a saying: If you're nervous imagine the audience naked. Or imagine they haven't seen you naked."" For anyone out there who hadn't seen Dunham in her birthday suit, she was quick to remedy that with the funniest skit of the night ""Biblical Movie.""

The New York Daily News referred to the piece as, ""The tale details Eve's struggles as a twentysomething in the Garden of Eden.""Duhman's Eve character is a spoof of her own character on Girls, Hannah.

It's like, are we like man and wife or is this a situation where it's like all these other girls and I'm gonna find out from the animals?""Adam responds, ""Oh, what are you talking about?

Literally, God made you from my rib, kid.""When told about the forbidden fruit God, Eve asks, ""Are you saying that in like a ""I suggest you don't,' or in like a 'Definitely don't,'  but with a side of 'Maybe do?'""The character Shoshanna from Girls makes a parody appearance as the Snake that speaks to Eve in the Garden.  The Snake rambles, ""You should like totally eat that apple.  And I know that God told you 'No,' but that was just a guideline.  Plus it'll make you so smart and no offense but I feel like a girl like you needs to be smart.""Dunham also participated in a skit parodying the hit ABC show Scandal. Dunham plays Kelsey, a new member to Olivia Pope's team with ""a thousand follow-up questions,"" when ordered to place a bug on an ambassador's wife in Mexico.  She says, ""I'll totally go, but you just talked so fast.""MStars reported on Feb 26 that the Girls star would be hosting SNL on March 8.

946	Girls is smart, well-made, thought-provoking, and very entertaining — provided you’re in the right mindset and/or have a high tolerance for watching selfish people go about their lives. That said, Lena Dunham’s adventure in auteurism isn’t exactly a laugh-out-loud sort of show — and really never has been, barring a few notable exceptions (Shoshanna on crack; Hannah and Elijah on coke; suddenly I’m sensing a pattern). I like to describe Broad City as “Girls, but funny” — which is probably why I like Broad City a whole lot more than I like Girls.Despite all this, I’ve still got high hopes for Lena Dunham’s first episode as host of Saturday Night Live. Why? Because while Girls isn’t funny, Dunham herself is; I’ve got no doubt that when she decides to make a pure comedy, she’ll end up creating something great. And perhaps more importantly, Dunham is an experienced writer with a fully developed voice, which is just what SNL needs right now.Last week’s episode — the first one in over a decade written without the input of Seth Meyers — was a mess from start to finish, stuffed with meandering, pointless sketches that weren’t clever enough to make up for their lack of solid jokes. (Maybe head writer Colin Jost was so busy preparing to take over Weekend Update that he didn’t have time to make sure the rest of the show was solid.) With a strong leader like Dunham at the helm, though, SNL‘s cast and writers may have the stewardship they need to turn in something more polished. And if nothing else, I’m expecting a show that bears Dunham’s stamp even when she isn’t headlining a sketch — which should make for one of this season’s more interesting experiments, even if it doesn’t end up being one of this season’s funnier installments.So, what can we expect to see tonight? I’d say a Girls parody, if SNL hadn’t already aired a (great) one earlier this season. Either way, I can’t see the show passing up the opportunity to have Noël Wells break out her Dunham impression again, most likely alongside the real Lena herself. (Though again, it’d be hard for them to top last fall’s Miley on Miley cold open.) Other things to look out for: Post-Oscars hangover, if there’s anything left to wring out, a True Detective parody before Sunday’s finale, some stuff about Putin, lots of work for the show’s ladies, and perhaps a cameo from one (or more) of Dunham’s famous pals (Mindy Kaling, Taylor Swift, etc.). Oh, and the smooth sounds of The National, a band that’s just the sort of indie rock powerhouse you’d expect to see alongside Dunham as she makes her SNL debut.Are you looking forward to Dunham’s SNL takeover? How many times do you think she or someone else in the cast will get naked, or be the butt of some kind of nudity joke? And in your estimation, how many of tonight’s sketches will focus on 1. Brooklyn, 2. feminism, 3. body image, and 4. the confluence of all three? Discuss in the comments, and check back tomorrow morning for my full recap.	Entertainment
947	"© 2018 Stuff LimitedLena Dunham made her hotly anticipated SNL debut this weekend, and  the verdict is in by the internet - she was a success!Never straying  too far from her Lena Dunham-ness/Hannah Horvath-ness, there was much  mocking of Girls, Dunham's nudity, an excellent Scandal spoof along with  a side of Jon Hamm (!) and apple shaming.Feminism and gender studies  101 were also plum topics, and everything worked, because as Kevin  Fallon wrote in the Daily Beast of Dunham's performance,""It should be no surprise that SNL churned out a  solid episode with Dunham as a host. The show excels most when it zeros  in on someone or something that seems to be touching a nerve at that  moment in popular culture, and then embraces, aggravates, and mocks that  nerve. Few people touch that nerve and incite so much passionate  conversation than Dunham and Girls.""The best sketch was a take on Adam and Eve with Dunham  as  Eve and Taran Killam (who was spot on!) playing Adam (Adam Driver, Adam  in Girls, and Biblical Adam) in the Garden of Eden. Dunham is totally  nude and is both body shamed and apple shamed by God.               Advertisement Kudos for this line,""I may have committed original sin, but at least it's original and I think I deserve credit for that.""Oh and this,""I'm not going to conform to society's demands of me.""And also when Adam says that Dunham is literally a part of her (the whole rib thing)""Oh my god that's so sexist, like take a gender and women's studies class!""Vanessa Bell as, like, Satan/Shoshanna with an excellent side hair donut was also wonderful.Dunham's opening monologue was also charming and featured this solid piece of advice.""If you're nervous about giving a speech, imagine the audience naked ... Or at least imagine they haven't seen you naked."" Snaps to Lena.© 2018 Stuff Limited"	Entertainment

	Lena Dunham left little to the imagination during her first hosting gig on ""Saturday Night Live.""
	The ""Girls"" star shed her clothing, as she often does in her hit HBO series, for a skit spoofing the show and its in-your-face nudity.
	Following the release of the biblical film ""Noah"" starring Russell Crowe and Emma Watson, comes the story of ""the first girl.""
	Dunham appears completely nude calling for her mate.
	""Adam, a snake just talked to me. Is that normal?"" she asked of Adam Driver (Taran Killam), who spoofs her boyfriend Adam in ""Girls.""
	The tale details Eve's struggles as a twentysomething in the Garden of Eden.
	""I just want to know what we're even doing here,"" she asked Adam. ""Are we like man and wife or is it this situation where there's, like, all these other girls and I'm going to find out from one of the animals?""
	""What are you talking about?"" Adam responded. ""You're like a part of me, literally. God made you from my rib, kid.""
	When the Holy One himself condemned them from eating apples, the 27-year-old actress questioned him.
	""Are you saying that in like a 'I suggest you don't' or in, like, a 'definitely don't' but with a side of, like, 'maybe do?'""
	Before taking a big bite out of the forbidden fruit, ""Eve"" consulted a snake that was supposed to be her ""Girls"" co-star Zosia Mamet's character, Shoshanna.
	Naked and surrounded by half-eaten apples, she awaits her fate in what was arguably the funniest skit of the evening.
	Dunham did well for her first shot at hosting the legendary sketch comedy show, but the skits overall left a lot to be desired.
	There was no doubt that, due to the criticism she often receives for her unapologetic nudity in ""Girls,"" that would be a big part of her comedy skits.
	In fact, she even defended the show's nakedness in her opening monologue.
	""Every show has its thing. 'Seinfeld' had the puffy shirt. 'Home Improvement' had the neighbor talking over the fence,"" she said. ""And we have very graphic sex scenes. That's our thing.""
	She continued by insisting how much she loves her job, but explained that the downfall is how complete strangers feel comfortable talking about their sex lives with her.
	""Like the other day a man on the street says, 'Hey Lena, your breasts look just like my sister’s,'"" she recalled. ""I had a lot of follow up questions like, 'Why would you know that?' and 'Does your sister have nice breasts?'""

949	"TrendingSince Lena Dunham is such a notable personality and a celeb with a clearly outlined persona, we weren’t exactly sure how she’d take to hosting Saturday Night Live, a gig that requires one to put on many faces. But by the time the Girls star was done, every worry we had was completely destroyed. But a handful of skits from the Mar. 8 episode of SNL specifically stand out.1. Lena Goes Nude For ‘Girl’






We’ve gotten a little tired of Lena stripping down, but doing it for an Adam and Eve movie was absolutely brilliant. And it was a new, smart way to spoof Girls. We loved Lena as a neurotic feminist Eve (and Shoshanna as a rambling snake), and this made-up movie review quote really sums up how nuanced and clever this sketch was: “The only part that didn’t ring true was when Eve did molly and went to a warehouse party with her gay ex-boyfriend.”2. Having “The Talk” Over And Over AgainBecause Lena is so open about her sexuality, she has a TON of repressed people coming up to her and telling her pretty intimate stuff. Like, “Your breasts look exactly like my sisters,” and “One of [my boyfriend’s] ‘tires’ is weirdly, like, smaller than the other.” 3. Sing It, Gi–We’ve all been there, belting out a song in our cars until we get cut off by the GPS lady. Though, we are a little confused about why it turned out Lena and company were trying to murder a guy… 4. Liza Minelli + Lena Dunam = Freaking The Funk OutThe only thing that trumps Jay Pharoah‘s Katt Williams impression is Lena tackling Liza Minelli. 5. Girlfriends Talk Show, Version 2.0We couldn’t get enough of this one. It may have been Lena’s facial expressions, her fabulous braids, or the fact that Jon Hamm (or, Josh Hamm) made a surprise appearance and worried that he was getting entrapped by Chris Harrison from Dateline. So what was YOUR favorite Lena Dunham moment, HollywoodLifers? Let us know!— Andrew GruttadaroFollow @AndrewGrutt"	Entertainment

by David Badash on March 9, 2014in Celebrities,NewsLena Dunham, everyone’s favorite feminist, last night played a very naked Eve in Saturday Night Live’s spoof on all the Bible films currently being released.So it was only natural for SNL to choose Dunham — who created, writes, and stars in HBO’s “Girls” — to star in their biblical parody, “Girl.”Dunham plays a very questioning Eve, one not willing to settle or conform.“Seriously,” Dunham’s Eve tells an angry God, as thunder and lightening explode, “I know I committed original sin, but at least it’s original — I think I deserve some credit for that. Or at least a publishing deal.”She also asks Taran Killam, who plays her boyfriend Adam Driver on “Girls,” “I just want to know what we’re even doing here. Are we like man and wife or is it this situation where there’s, like, all these other girls and I’m going to find out from one of the animals?”“What are you talking about?” Adam responded. “You’re like a part of me, literally. God made you from my rib, kid.”In 2013, Dunham told reporters, “I am not engaged. I don’t want to get married until all gay people can get married.”Dunham is the author of Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She’s “Learned”, to be released this fall.Remember how the GOP and religious right went nuts over Dunham’s 2012 campaign ad supporting President Barack Obama that equated “your first time” with your first time voting?This should make them go biblically-ballistic.Previously:Jane Lynch Really Wants You To Watch This Awesome VideoLena Dunham Responds To Conservative Critics: ‘Vote For Women’s Rights’Tagged as:

“Lena Dunham and The National”
March 8, 2014hannahorvath.tumblr.comI will be interested in hearing other people’s thoughts on Lena Dunham’s Saturday Night Live performance last night, because I suspect the reactions will mirror people’s feelings about Lena Dunham and her HBO series Girls: folks will either have found her performance delightfully quirky and intelligent or will VEHEMENTLY HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT AND HER, OH MY GOD WHY IS SHE NAKED AGAIN, WHY CAN’T SHE KEEP HER CLOTHES ON?My personal feelings about Dunham fall somewhere in between these extremes: she is smart! she is funny! she is also nerve-gratingly irritating at times and I am often left not entirely convinced that she is as self-aware as she thinks she is. Which is how I also felt about this episode. Lena Dunham brought youth and vivaciousness and a distinct feminist voice to the episode, and her Liza Minnelli! Not bad! Not bad at all! And yet, at the same time, she was entirely too dependent on the cue cards and spent much of the episode being the most Lena Dunham she could possibly be, which sometimes can be too much Lena Dunham.I guess what I’m getting at is that last night’s Saturday Night Live wasn’t a bad episode — it certainly wasn’t as dreadful as last week’s, that’s for sure — but I was left feeling like ultimately the highlight of night was the announcement that Louis C.K. will be returning as host on March 29th. Hooray, that!nbcsnl.tumblr.comThe cold open: I mean, first of all, Liam Neeson. (Remember when he used to be a Serious Actor in Serious Movies? Me neither.) But second of all, bear-wrestling Obama. Come on. Even if you hate Obama in real life, you kinda liked shirtless, horse-riding, biker-wrestling, bear-punching Obama. Admit it.Lena Dunham’s monologue wasn’t bad, exactly, but it was uncomfortably awkward, and not in a cute Girls-esque awkward way. The material itself was fine, but it’s clear that Dunham is not accustomed to standing in front of an audience. Or delivering jokes. Or reading off of cue cards.Perhaps the best bit of the night was the taped piece, “Ooh Child,” in part for its unexpectedly dark ending. And that’s all I’m going to say to avoid spoiling it.CONFESSION: I don’t watch Scandal — and I’m not about to start, so save your comments – but I know enough about the show to appreciate this spot-on spoof.And here’s where things start to fall apart. This bit wherein a bunch of hippies in hemp skirts and Birkenstocks perform an embarrassing “rap” on a hip-hop show is a funny premise, but that ending made the entire thing go from “ha-ha” painful to just, “ouch, please stop pulling off my fingernails with those pliers” painful.The Girls take on the Adam and Eve story? Pretty terrific, actually.What are you even doing, Jon Hamm? You’re being crazy. (Also? Can we replace the “Girlfriends” recurring bit with this one? Thanks, that’d be great.) More of Taran Killam’s Matthew McConaughey, please and thank you!Oh look, you guys,  it’s Fred Armisen from all the way down the hall. I like the “Best Friends” recurring bit well enough. It’s no “Drunk Uncle,” or anything, but it’s fine.And remember that San Antonio food truck that found itself in trouble for its clever name (“Cock Asian”)? It made it into the Weekend Update this week:Soooooo … let’s talk about the “Jewelry Party.” In the bit, Lena Dunham’s character takes on and shames a men’s rights advocate. This isn’t a terrible idea for a sketch as men’s rights advocates are inherently ridiculous and mockable characters to begin with. However, the punchlines fall flat and feel hectoring — having the men’s rights advocate be meek rather than confrontational or bullying makes him almost sympathetic instead of pitiful. Also? Cecily? Stop shouting. And take that ridiculous thing off your head.“Pimpin’ Pimpin’ Pimpin’ with Katt Williams.” First of all, Jay Pharoah’s Katt Williams is pretty good, if not quite crazy enough. But second of all, who knew Lena Dunham had such a great Liza Minnelli in her back pocket? And third of all (shut up, that’s an expression), why was this all we saw of Noël Well’s Lena Dunham impersonation? It’s solid! They should have done more with it!The evening ended with another oddball taped bit involving Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney being really excited about a Will Smith concert. Unfortunately, thanks to the use of a snippet of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme, NBC didn’t post it online. Boo.Oh, and, The National performed and people (some of my editors) tend to get really worked up about them. So I’m just going to leave their performances here if you are interested. Personally, I am not. Also, cheer up already, guys.snlnbc.tumblr.comNote: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post’s poll.

                                Lena Dunham hosts SNL. Photo: Getty
Lena Dunham made her hotly anticipated SNL debut this weekend, and the verdict is in by the internet - she was a success! Never straying too far from her Lena Dunham-ness/Hannah Horvath-ness, there was much mocking of Girls, Dunham's nudity, an excellent Scandal spoof along with a side of Jon Hamm (!) and apple shaming. Feminism and gender studies 101 were also plum topics, and everything worked, because as Kevin Fallon wrote in the Daily Beast of Dunham's performance,""It should be no surprise that SNL churned out a solid episode with Dunham as a host.

She might be a buzzworthy entertainment personality, but as ratings for “Girls” will confirm, she is not a major television draw.That her appearance on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” drew unremarkable ratings should therefore come as no surprise.Saturday’s “SNL,” which featured Dunham as host and The National as its musical guest, posted a soft 4.1 overnight household rating.  It drew a 2.1 adults 18-49 rating in the twenty five markets with local people meters.Down from last week’s ratings, both numbers are among the worst delivered this season.  Only the Edward Norton-hosted episode on October 26, which tied this one in adults 18-49, drew a weaker household rating (3.9), and only the Josh Hutcherson-hosted episode on November 23, which tied this one in households, drew a weaker adults 18-49 number (2.0).“SNL” returns on March 29 with Louis CK as host.lena dunhamnbcsaturday night livesnlthe nationalBrian Cantor is the editor-in-chief for Headline Planet.

Lena Dunham surprised us all last night when she went completely naked for SNL’s Girl – a parody of her hit HBO series Girls – in which she plays Eve, the first woman.As this week’s guest host, we already knew we were in store for some outlandish and surprising behavior but who knew Lena would give us the sight we’ve been waiting for and strip down to completely nothing?Lena says to Taran Killam, who is portraying Adam Driver as Adam:“Can you please not apple shame me right now? Seriously, I know I committed original sin, but at least it’s original.”Hilarious! Check it out via in the video above. Lena, girl, you are something special.SOURCE: NBCCopyright © 2018 Interactive One, LLC. All Rights ReservedPowered by WordPress.com VIP"	Entertainment
955	"Considering how gigantically popular Lena Dunham has become in the past few years, we haven’t really seen her in any large roles that she wasn’t completely in control of. Her characters in Tiny Furniture and especially on Girls are always considered not that far removed from Dunham herself, since she wrote and stars as the main characters in both. So putting Dunham on SNL puts her in a position where she’s much less in control, yet for the most part Dunham does a fine job in her first hosting gig.The opening skit has President Obama addressing the country about Russia’s recent activities in Crimea, leading to a cameo by Liam Neeson who of course hates when things are taken. While it is great to see Neeson jumping into his newfound action star status, and he’s clearly fine with parodying himself as he does here, on Key & Peele and The Lego Movie, I am getting incredibly tired of hearing different takes on the one line from Taken that everyone remembers. I mean, the movie came out five years ago; give Neeson a break from it.Dunham’s monologue has her poking fun at the sexuality and nudity on Girls, saying that now strangers want to give her personal information about their sex lives. This leads to the cast interrupting to share their various details, then to Kate McKinnon playing Dunham’s grandmother. Throughout the night, Dunham’s performance seems to be combination of understandable nervousness and excitement, but she’s also ready to roll with the punches, go along with her mistakes and just have fun with the opportunity, which works well for her.Dunham is much more comfortable in both of the prerecorded skits she appears in, which also end up as two of the stronger bits of the night. The first involves four friends in a car singing along to “Ooh Child,” yet whenever it’s Dunham’s turn to sing, the GPS directions interrupt her time to shine. It’s a cute skit that ends with a great twist.The second prerecorded skit is a Girls parody simply called Girl, about Eve in the Garden of Eden. Taran Killam plays Adam—a combination of the Bible’s Adam and Adam Driver—with Vanessa Bayer showing up as a Marnie snake. SNL has pretty much nailed parodying Girls in the past, so having Dunham involved is just icing on the cake.Dunham’s best performance of the night as far as the live show goes is in a perfect Scandal parody. She plays a new member of Olivia Pope’s Gladiator team and constantly points out just how insane this show truly is. I basically quit watching Scandal because of the ridiculous things that are pointed out in this skit and Dunham’s fascination with just how perfect everyone in the cast is really sells this one.The rest of the night consisted mostly of fake TV shows, most of which just went on far too long, the biggest offender being “What’s Poppin,’” a show about rap music hosted by Jay Pharaoh and Kenan Thompson. The show’s musical guest is an all-white jazzy ensemble called “That’s a Rap,” whose raps are bland and filled with flute music. At the very least, it gives Mike O’Brien more time in the spotlight, but goes on for far too long and doesn’t really have an ending.“What Are You Even Doing? You’re Being Crazy,” which seems like it really wants to be a recurring segment, was another fake TV show starring Nasim Pedrad and Dunham as two girls who have hit puberty three hours earlier, and now they’re insanely awkward around guys. Their first guest is Kyle Mooney as a soccer player at their school who is there because he was promised pizza. Their second guest in Jon Hamm as himself, who is afraid this is some sort of Dateline thing and is also disappointed with the lack of pizza. The whole situation is watched over by Pedrad’s older brother, Brett, played by Bobby Moynihan, who gets some great reactions in an episode where he rarely features. I could see this working a few more times, especially since having an actual star appear is quite funny, even more so if every time Jon Hamm returns.It’s crazy to think that The National haven’t been the musical guest on SNL before, but it surely won’t be the last after their two performances. “Graceless” ended with an intense finale that seemed reminiscent of some of their older material, while “I Need My Girl” was a beautiful finale for them and more in line with the types of songs for which they’re more well known.Weekend Update hasn’t found the right balance between Colin Jost and Cecily Strong yet, and there’s not really any interaction between the two. However, we do get Killam appearing as Matthew McConaughey—or a version that combines Oscar’s McConaughey with Rust Cohle—which is also really close to Killam’s Brad Pitt impression. Putin’s best friends also show up with Bayer and Fred Armisen popping up again. Now that Armisen is back in 30 Rock thanks to his gig on Seth Meyers’ new show, I wouldn’t be surprised if we still see a bit of him.A jewelry party skit gave O’Brien another chance to shine as a men’s rights activist at a party filled with women. It’s incredibly awkward, and O’Brien’s interactions with Strong make for the funniest bits (while also continuing my disappointment that O’Brien isn’t at the Update desk with Strong instead of Jost).“Pimpin’ Pimpin’ Pimpin’ with Katt Williams” stars Jay Pharaoh as Williams doing an Oscar post-show. This is the second time Katt Williams has been parodied this season, and it feels like SNL is a few years behind on this impression. Williams brings on Jared Leto (Whelan), Liza Minnelli (Dunham) and Harrison Ford (Killam), all of whom deliver merely okay impressions. The bit ends with Noel Wells popping up as Lena Dunham, which had to be thrown in there somewhere, but is completely out of place in this skit.I do love that SNL has been ending the night with the Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney skits, which are just weird enough to make the last slot of the night. Here they play two office workers trying to organize the office into seeing Will Smith perform at Radio City Music Hall, with Whelan as the employee who just doesn’t want any part of their e-mail chains and plans. It also has a great twist. Whelan hasn’t had much time on the show this year, but after appearing several times this episode, I hope we see a lot more of him.Dunham’s enthusiasm in her first hosting gig made her a success. Give her a few more episodes, and she could really find her groove and be quite a great host. Yet sometimes just having the excitement and desire to be there can really make up for the fear and insecurities that can come from live television.

After a particularly rough episode last week, Saturday Night Live bounced back nicely with host Lena Dunham last night. For someone who doesn't necessarily have much range, Dunham was better than expected, mostly playing variations on herself and her character from Girls (the only exception: her Liza Minnelli impression late in the episode). The surprise cameos by Liam Neeson, Fred Armisen and Jon Hamm were pretty hilarious, the Girls and Scandal parodies were just right, and we got a couple of the best sketches of the season (Ooh Child, What Are You Even Doing). Hell, even the cold open was better than normal!In recent weeks, SNL has gotten smarter about inserting some of the stranger sketches early on in the night—sketches that once would have been relegated to the ten-to-1 slot are getting a chance before midnight, and they've been some of the best of the season. This week, we got two that fit that bill, including Ooh Child, in which frustrations over a car singalong leads to a surprise ending, and What's Poppin, which focused on an all-white ""rap"" group. SNL is always better when they go weird (writer/performer Mike O'Brien has stood out this season thanks to his surreal sensibilities), and nothing screams weird like flute amps, Sprite chugging, and ""my rap name is Tim.""Taran Killam had a particularly good night filled with impressions, as Adam Driver in the Girls parody, Harrison Ford in Katt Williams Talk Show, and his killer Matthew McConaughey on Weekend Update, which required a couple rewinds to catch all the hilarious lines. What Are You Even Doing with Nasim Pedrad was a cousin of Girlfriends Talk Show, but the performances by Bobby Moynihan, Kyle Bennett, and especially a bewildered Jon Hamm, added a lot of laughs. Obama's tough guy video and Neeson livened up the political cold open, Brooks Wheelan had a couple nice moments as Jared Leto and a kidnapped person, and The National knocked it out of the park with ""Graceless"" and a lovely ""I Need My Girl.""There were some weaker sketches of course, including the overstuffed MRA-referencing Jewelry Party and the overlong Katt Williams one. Colin Jost is still getting comfortable behind the desk on Weekend Update, and there were the usual problems with the featured players: Noel Wells, John Milhiser and Beck Bennett got almost nothing to do. Well, Wells did get to break out her Dunham impression at the very end of the Katt Williams sketch, but still.It was inevitable that some of the newbies would be shuffled to the side with such a huge cast this season, but it'd be nice to see them get a few more featured roles before the season is done. SNL is off the air for the next couple weeks, but will return on March 29th with host Louis C.K. (!) and musical guest Pharrell Williams."	Entertainment
963	"Last night, The National were the musical guests on Saturday Night Live. The band performed two songs off of their latest album, Trouble Will Find Me, “Graceless” and “I Need My Girl.” Prior to the show, Lena Dunham, who was the host, tweeted: “Just a heads up: The National made me cry in rehearsal today. Like, with the power of their music. They weren’t mean or anything.”

964	"In one of the weirdest sketches of last night's 'SNL,' Nasim Pedrad and guest host Lena Dunham play the teenage hosts of their own web show. Broadcasting from a basement (where Bobby Moynihan lives and plays video games), ""What Are You Even Doing? You're Being Crazy"" is exactly the kind of show two young girls with a limited understanding of the world would put on. And yet, somehow, they've booked 'Mad Men' star Jon Hamm as a guest.First, the girls bring on a football player from school (gamely played by Kyle Mooney), who finds himself subjected to all kinds of inane and awkward questions, always being told that he's ""being crazy"" no matter what he says. At first, the sketch appears to be fairly standard stuff, but then Hamm enters and things get pretty great. A terrified Hamm demands to know if this is a ""Chris Hansen thing,"" saying that he has no idea what the show is and that his agent told him to be there (he was promised pizza).Of course, the oblivious hosts are unaware that they have Don friggin' Draper on camera with them, so they never ask him any relevant questions. But they do ask him to flirt to the camera, which results in the best Jon Hamm face ever.Get our Newsletter"	Entertainment

966	15I’m going to go ahead and speculate that a small but especially vocal minority of the internet-equipped viewing public was tuning in tonight to see if Lena Dunham was going to fall flat on her face. Is it because she’s young, and clearly talented, and very successful? Oh, and an outspoken woman? Just guesses there, but I may be onto something with that last one.  That being said/provoked, there were some questions going into Dunham’s hosting gig, the most important of which was whether she could shed her singular persona and don a variety of roles. Her most high-profile gigs thus far have seen her playing characters perceived as being very like herself—outside of a neurotic, self-obsessed overreacher, did she have any range? And would she be willing to turn herself over to the show’s writers and make an ass out of herself? Well, the results being in, Dunham did better on the second score than on the first—but her enthusiasm went a long way toward making up for the fact that multi-character sketch comedy may not be in Dunham’s wheelhouse. The cold open saw President Obama calling in career-resurgent sexagenarian action  star Liam Neeson in order for Neeson to call on his “certain set of skills” (his Hollywood contacts) producing a video riposte to Vladimir Putin’s ongoing series of ludicrous tough guy shirtless photo ops. As far as an SNL political satire about the ongoing Crimean situation, it was about as good as we get these days—at least the crowd-pleasing entrance of the very game Neeson was a genuine surprise. Jay Pharoah’s impression continues technically proficient and largely uninvolving—and it’s light years better than whatever Fred Armisen was allowed to trot out for a few years—but, especially with the participation of “Liam Neesons,” it’s hard not to compare Pharoah’s Obama unfavorably to Jordan Peele’s. That may be because Key & Peele has more of a handle on or, you know, a point of view about the character, but I did laugh when the third question Obama relates from the American public is “Hold up—what’s Crimea?” Plus, the deconstruction of Fox News’ recent obsession with praising Putin’s staged, he-man publicity stunts had to be done. Dunham’s monologue hinged on a questionable premise—all the sex scenes on Girls cause random people to overshare their carnal exploits with her—but Dunham’s delivery was strong throughout, and the jokes at the expense of herself and her show were on target. Confessing her nervousness, Dunham relates that she was told to imagine her audience naked, “or at least imagine they haven’t seen you naked.” And her anecdote about the guy who claimed her breasts looked just like his sister’s (“I had a lot of follow up questions”) landed satisfyingly. And the oversharing idea, as tenuous as it was comedically, did touch on the idea that Dunham’s fame has come with a lot of unwelcome public attention. Plus, while the whole “cast interrupts the monologue” idea keeps coming back as if there were simply no other template to work from (apart from a musical number), Kate McKinnon, playing Dunham’s unexpectedly randy grandmother, once again showcased her ability to create a specific, inhabited character in a short period of time, which has always been one of SNL’s most invaluable commodities. Too bad she seems to have been sent home shortly afterward. I liked the way the first filmed piece turned just as its initial premise (a car’s directional app only interrupts Dunham’s character when she attempts join in her companions’ singalong to The Five Stairsteps’ “O-o-h Child”), with the chipper quartet revealed as murderous vigilantes heading out to bury their victim. Dunham’s escalating impatience was amusingly done, but I was just starting to think Lorne had wasted the music licensing fee before the whole thing went to the unexpected (and appreciated) dark place. AdvertisementDunham’s first real test—and only real triumph—was in the Scandal parody, where her ditsy new associate Kelsey remains delightedly baffled by the nigh superhuman chicanery of Olivia Pope and Associates. Having never seen a single episode of Scandal (back off you guys—there is so much TV to watch, seriously), the joke still landed, since the premise was established just fine. Ordered to get to Mexico, infiltrate an embassy ball, and bug a diplomat’s wife, Dunham’s “Okay—I have, like, a thousand follow-up questions” spoke to viewers perhaps unconvinced that everything is quite as easy as the show makes it seem. Also, Kelsey’s objection that Olivia, “a beautiful black woman who only wears tailored pantsuits” should go on the mission since “these are the fanciest clothes I own” and her rejection of Olivia’s romantic woes since, “I wish my dating problem’s that my boyfriend’s the president” keep the joke flowing along with Dunham’s energetic character (although she was hitting the teleprompter especially hard throughout). And Sasheer Zamata has her first real star moment of the season—she anchors the sketch with a passable Kerry Washington, but it’s her bit of business reacting rapturously to Taran Killam’s Fitz putting his fingers in her mouth that is one of those small but impactful things that stick in the audience’s mind. It’s a funny bit because it pops—there’s really no more scientific explanation for SNL success than that. I always get cringe-y whenever SNL does rap music sketches. It’s not that they’re always terrible, it’s that they invariably approach the genre from the outside (no matter how many funny hats they give Kenan Thompson to wear).  This time at least, the premise of the sketch was loopy enough, and the concept of an all-white jazz/beat poet band proclaiming themselves rappers brought the whole racial divide to the forefront, but the band’s song went on for far too long. Dunham looked uncomfortable and, apart from Pharoah’s horrified “NO!” and Mike O’Brien’s attempt to claim that Tim is his “rapping name,” this one dragged on and dribbled out to a non-ending. Dunham other good sketch was “Girl,” where she costarred with Taran Killam’s Adam Driver (not his strongest impression) in a Dunham-ized Biblical epic about the Garden of Eden. It’s here that she took the most shots at herself, with the sketch’s nonstop, pixilated nakedness (A.O. Scott says, “Even for Adam and Eve, that’s a lot of nudity”), and her Eve’s suspiciously Hannah Horvath-like quibbling over every detail with both Adam and God turning a the writer/director/star’s would-be religious blockbuster into yet another extension of Dunham’s signature, solipsistic style. To quote the sketch’s Wall Street Journal, “If this is feminism, I’m confused.” AdvertisementVenturing into character work in the middle school girl talk show “What Are You Even Doing? You’re Being Crazy!” saw the host eclipsed by partner Nasim Pedrad. Again, this sort of broad, throw yourself into it role seemed out of Dunham’s comfort zone, with she and Pedrad playing a pair of young teens who just entered puberty “like three hours ago” and making invited guests Kyle Mooney and, as himself, Jon Hamm very uncomfortable, flirting with clueless enthusiasm. It’s always nice to get some unexpected Hamm (and him being pissed that there was no pizza was worth a laugh), but apart from big brother Bobby Moynihan’s unexplained, wind machine-aided glamor shot, this one didn’t approach the heights of, say, Amy Poehler’s Kaitlin in the realm of “tweens acting hyper” genre. After seven sketches and the first number from The National, it was finally time for Weekend Update and, once again, I’m not feeling this new anchor team. Cecily Strong and Colin Jost both seem far too pleasant and, well, grateful for the gig, their fixed smiles and occasional giggles removing the edges from their material. Not that the post-Seth Meyers jokes have had much bite—tonight, the closest thing to a toothy joke targeted the zoological puzzle of a Rand Paul metaphor (“Will we be like lemmings, rushing to the comfort of Big Brother’s crushing embrace—or will we be like Rand Paul, not quite understanding what lemmings do.”) It’s early, but Strong and Jost haven’t shown any chemistry or ability to play off one another—their jokes zip by in innocuous isolation. It’s a problem. On the visitor front, the big winner tonight was Killam’s stellar Matthew McConaughey, revisiting his typically spacy Oscar speech (“Don’t congratulate me, congratulate the man who never existed” “Who’s that?” “That’s me”) and just generally rambling in the delirious glory that is McConaughey’s mind. As everyone from Matt Damon to everyone you know has proven for years, even a bad McConaughey is reliably funny, and with Killam piloting the surfboard, this could have gone on for five more minutes as far as I was concerned. (Extra points for getting the audience to segue inexplicably into the Inspector Gadget theme.) Beyond that, Fred Armisen returned to join Vanessa Bayer playing those two people who were a dictator’s (Putin this time) childhood friends, whispering their mundane complaints about the despot’s social rudeness. Proving once again that, no matter how big Portlandia gets, or how demanding his duties as Seth Meyers’ bandleader, he’s always game to noodle around with a weird voice in a middling recurring bit. “Jewelry Party” was tailored most overtly to Dunham’s outspoken feminism, with everyone at said gathering discovering that the one male attendee is a rabid “men’s rights” advocate. There’s not much to it, with Dunham’s character become incensed the more she learns about the guy’s activities (shutting down Planned Parenthoods and lobbying against equal pay for women) and the theme of the sketch being that all such men are just sad virgins who were rejected in high school, but at least Mike O’Brien wrings some uncomfortable laughs desperately attempting to assert his innocuousness with some funny underplaying and—while I don’t know why it was necessary for Cecily Strong to put on an accent to play a kooky hairdresser from South America—at least it injected some energy. AdvertisementJay Pharoah, every bit the impressionist Taran Killam is, is handicapped by the fact that often the majority of the SNL audience is simply unfamiliar with the figures he’s so adept at. Tonight’s example is pint-sized comedian and pimp enthusiast Katt Williams and, while Pharoah’s impression is a lot better than Drake’s from earlier this season, it suffers from the fact that the audience’s titters are clearly uncomfortable/uncomprehending and that Williams’ persona is pretty offputting even if you do know who the hell he is. There’s a funny kernel to William’s BET post-Oscars talk show, in that he’s turning the tables by presenting white actors that black viewers don’t know or care about (and his line introducing Liza Minnelli, that she’s a household name “if that house belongs to Ben Vereen” is solid), but the rest of the sketch sinks under the weight of some mediocre impressions by Brooks Wheelan (Jared Leto), Dunham (Liza—she’s a gamer, but it’s just beyond her), and Killam’s limited Harrison Ford (who falls back on movie lines.) Finishing up, the show filled the ten-to-one spot by giving Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett a video camera and letting them do something odd and conceptual—an idea I heartily approve of. Sure this one, about a pair of detail-oriented office workers attempting to organize an outing to a Will Smith concert with their annoyed office mate wasn’t their best (that’d be the fratboy bit from the Bruce Willis episode), but, again, just letting these two run with a weird idea is always worth the risk. Dunham hugging Jon Hamm and telling the audience that she wanted to French kiss every one of them at home base closed it out, a goofily triumphant image of a host who’d taken her best swings and come through just as she came in—energetic and seemingly thrilled to be hosting.

""Girls"" creator Lena Dunham is going to write a four-part story for Archie Comics. According to a press release, the story, to be published in 2015, will be about what happens when the eponymous redhead and his gang encounter a reality show filming in their town.“I was an avid Archie collector as a child- conventions, first editions that l kept in plastic sleeves, the whole shebang. It has so much cultural significance but also so much personal significance, and to get to play with these beloved characters is a wild creative opportunity,” Dunham said.Obviously we aren’t expecting any nudity or cocaine binges. This is PG-rated “Archie,” not “Girls,” right? Well, that’s what we thought until we saw the promotional poster. Look familiar?Here’s the promotional Archie Comics image for Dunham’s comics debut:And this is the promo for the third season of “Girls” on HBO.Will Dunham’s raucous behavior change Riverdale forever? We can’t wait to snuggle up in our beds with a flashlight and find out.Dunham also had her debut hosting gig this week as she hosted Saturday Night Live. The show will surely be full of Dunham's quirky humor.

970	"""Before there were girls, there was the first Girl.""So begins the Girls parody to end all parodies, featuring Lena Dunham in all her hipster glory on Saturday Night Live. In the video, Dunham apes her own hit HBO comedy with a biblical spoof in which she stars as Eve, ""a struggling twenty-something in the garden of Eden.""See also: 'SNL' Is Reclaiming Its Turf via Social Media â€” Just in TimeThe video was one of the highlights of Dunham's first time hosting SNL this weekend. Dunham and other cast members also did a nice job riffing on ABC's show Scandal. Dunham wasn't the only actor to make an appearance on the latest SNL. Liam Neeson made a cameo during a cold open in which President Obama (played by cast member Jay Pharoah) gave an address on the international conflict in the Ukraine. "	Entertainment

As Twitchy readers know, the latest episode of “Saturday Night Live” had a skit featuring actress Lena Dunham spewing Planned Parenthood propaganda. Viewers pushed back, but let’s keep it simple for the SNL shills; here is something they neglected to mention about Planned Parenthood.

""Lena Dunham says, Planned Parenthood is where you go to get low cost medical advice and care."" @nbcsnl #SNL Unless you are a baby.
— Milo Yiannopoulos (@Woodshedder) March 9, 2014

New York's own Lena Dunham hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" last night, and was only naked some of the time.Dunham brought up nudity right away, with this line in her monologue: ""There's a saying: If you're nervous imagine the audience naked. Or imagine they haven't seen you naked.""She took off her clothes for a skit spoofing on her show, ""Girls."" Dunham played a Hannah Horvath-inspired Eve in a trailer for a faux ""Adam and Eve"" blockbuster.Watch the segment below: AdvertisementSign up for NYC news plus the scoop on things to do, see and eat.By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."

973	"Nancy is a Pop Culture Blogger at Complex Media.@nancerdancer/Facebook/LinkedIn/Google+Girls star Lena Dunham made her much-anticipated Saturday Night Live debut last night. It was a mixed bag—she definitely wasn&apos;t a superstar like Justin Timberlake or Drake, but she didn&apos;t tank, either. The cold open once again featured Jay Pharoah and his Obama impression. He&apos;s trying to take a hard line with Vladimir Putin, so he calls Liam Neeson to help out. The real Neeson gives Putin a threatening message: ""Crimea has been taken. I don&apos;t like things being taken."" The monologue dealt mostly with the success of Girls, and how total strangers now come up to Dunham to tell her about their sex lives. But Girls is in its third season. Why are we talking about it like Dunham is dealing with overnight fame?Next was a pretty on-point digital short about singing in the car. Friends take turns belting out ""O-o-h Child,"" but Dunham is repeatedly interrupted by the phone&apos;s GPS directions, which happens to us all the time. Siri needs to back off—we can&apos;t turn left in 100 feet, it&apos;s a red light. Stop ruining our Britney jam.Dunham (in a long wig) played Scandal&apos;s newest gladiator who&apos;s amazing at how fast they do everything. It seemed mostly like a reason to use Sasheer Zamata, the first black female cast member since 2007. She&apos;s not particularly Oliva Pope-like, but OK. At least it highlights how ridiculous that show is and allowed Dunham to live out her dream of guest starring on it.One of the weirder sketches was ""What&apos;s Poppin?"" with Pharoah and Kenan Thompson, who were confused when some sort of hippie spoken-word band came on their hip-hop show to perform. We do imagine that&apos;s what people who make spoken-word albums look and act like.On the other hand, the Adam and Eve parody of Girls was on-point. Hannah Horvath questions god (""Do you mean no...with a side of maybe yes?"") and Taran Killam as Adam Driver calls her kid. Hannah deals with living in paradise with an endless stream of questions. Shosh as the snake who convinces her to eat the apple is great. ""I know I committed original sin, but at least I was being original.""A lot of people hated on the sketch ""What Are You Even Doing? You&apos;re Being Crazy,"" but they must not have ever been middle school girls. Dunham and Nasim Pedrad play two tweens livestreaming their show for their classmates. The captain of the soccer team shows up, and he and Pedrad hold hands until it overcomes them. Oh, good times. Jon Hamm showed up—we&apos;re not sure why, but when Jon Hamm shows up, we don&apos;t ask questions. ""Is this, like, a Dateline/Chris Hansen thing?"" he asks the youngsters.Time for ""Weekend Update."" Cecily Strong is growing into the role, but her new co-host Colin Jost still has some adjusting to do. He did excellently deliver a line about an Asian food truck called—no joke—""Cock Asian."" Alum Fred Armisen stopped by to play Putin&apos;s best friends with Vanessa Bayer. Oh, and inexplicably, Taran Killam was Matthew McConaughey. Lots of people do a great McConaughey impression, so we can&apos;t believe Killam&apos;s was the best at 30 Rock. He, of course, looks nothing like the Oscar winner, and he couldn&apos;t even get the voice right when spoofing his Academy Award acceptance speech.The worst sketch of the night was ""Jewelry Party,"" where a group of girlfriends are hanging out over wine and jewelry, but one of the gals has brought her new boyfriend, who turns out to be a Mens&apos; Rights Activist. The only thing worth discussing is Strong&apos;s South American accent. We&apos;re not sure why she was doing it, but she needs to start playing Sofía Vergara, stat.Jay Pharaoh pulled another great impression out of his bag of tricks for ""Pimpin&apos; Pimpin&apos; Pimpin&apos; with Katt Williams: Oscar Edition."" He decided to bring on a bunch of crazy white people that most black people have never heard of. ""You&apos;re lucky you&apos;re the prettiest man I&apos;ve ever seen,"" he said to Jared Leto. Killam did a pretty good Harrison Ford (seriously, what did happen to him?!) and Dunham was a perfect combination of oblivious and excited as Liza Minelli. Also, we hope Katt Williams really has MCed an oompa loompa convention. Just saying.To end the night, some of the lesser-known cast members did a digital short about annoying coworkers sending you emails about everything. They were trying to organize an outing to a Will Smith concert. It did capture the endless pit of hell that is your work inbox but it was also pretty weird. There wasn&apos;t even a Will Smith concert to go to. Er, OK. Glad we ended on that note.Dunham said thank you to musical guest The National as she stood next to Jon Hamm. ""I want to French kiss all of you!"" she exclaimed. Maybe next time.Written by Nancy Stiles (@nancerdancer)RELATED: Kanye West Talks About His SNL Past on Late Night with Seth MeyersRELATED: Jim Parsons&apos; Best SNL Skits"	Entertainment

She added that every show has its “thing,” and Girls< /i>’ happens to be “very graphic sex scenes.”
One of the sketches featured a spoof on her hit HBO show, imagined in biblical times.TIME notes Dunham appears nude in the movie trailer of the would-be film, in which she stars as Eve. It’s set in the Garden of Eden, naturally.The night’s musical guest was The National. How did you think Dunham did hosting SNL?Here’s the opening monologue:

976	"“Girls” creator Lena Dunham hosted ""Saturday Night Live” this weekend and she addressed frequent nudity on her hit HBO series right away.""If you’re nervous about giving a speech just imagine the audience naked, or at least imagine they haven’t seen you naked,” Dunham, who's was hosting ""SNL"" for the first time, said in her opening monologue.“I mention that because…some people complain about the nudity on 'Girls,' but every show has its thing,"" she said. ""'Seinfeld' had the puffy shirt, 'Home Improvement' had the neighbor talking over the fence, and we have very graphic sex scenes.”“That’s our thing,” she said casually.Lena Dunham: ""SNL"" Girls"" Spoof Was ""One of the Best Things Ever"" Dunham went on to explain that although she loves her job, the one downside to playing Hannah Horvath, is that fans feel comfortable asking her very personal questions.“That’s why I’m happy to be here at 'SNL' where people actually respect boundaries,” she said, only to be interrupted by cast member Vanessa Bayer, who wanted ""to tell her something very personal” and proceeded to discuss details about her boyfriend.Cast members Adily Bryant and Bobby Moynihan also followed Bayer’s lead and started to discuss personal issues. Moynihan walked on stage in a robe, opened it in front of Dunham and asked, “Is this normal?”An embarrassed Dunham mentioned that her 94-year-old grandmother, Dorothy (Kate McKinnon) was in the audience.  She apologized to her “Grandma Dot,” but Dunham’s grandmother started to tell her own story.“You know in 1940, only the cool girls went to third base, and I was cool as hell,” she said.In another spoof of  ""Girls,"" Dunham played Eve in a movie trailer for a biblical film ""Girl,"" coming to theaters after ""Noah"" and ""Son of God.""The movie, about ""Lena Dunham's unique take on the life of Eve as a struggling twenty something in the Garden of Eden"" also starred Adam, played by ""Girls'"" Adam Driver (Taran Killam) and another ""Girls"" castmember Shoshanna as the snake's head.Naturally, both Dunham and Adam strutted naked through the garden.""You're like a part of me, literally. God made you from my rib, kid,"" Adam told Dunham in his trademark baritone, when she tried to find out if he's seeing other women.""Oh my God, that is like so sexist, I can't believe you even bring that up right now,"" Dunham exclaimed. ""Like, take a gender or women's studies class.""And when Dunham -- like biblical -- Eve finally gave into temptation, she complained, “I know I committed original sin,"" she said sitting in a pile of half-eaten apples, ""but at least it’s original, I think I deserve some credit for that, or at least a publishing deal.”The trailer quoted a review by A.O. Scott of  ""The New York Times"" which said, “Even for Adam and Eve, there’s a lot of nudity” in ""Girl.""Lena Dunham Mocks ""Girls"" Nude Scenes in ""SNL"" Promos with Kate McKinnonBringing attention to Dunham’s feminist side, a sketch placed her in a  situation with a male activist who fought against Planned Parenthood  and equal pay among men and women. Realizing what he was getting into, Bruce (Mike O’Brien)  -- the only boyfriend that showed up to a jewelry party --  tried to cover up what his job was by saying he’s a “grassroots activist.”His girlfriend, Marisol (Cecily Strong) from Venezuela completely outed him, not understanding why he was trying to cover up his career.""Bruce is a men's rights activist, he fights equal pay of men and women"" she said proudly.""You fight against equal pay for men and women?"" Dunham asked.""I fight for the right to be paid more, if you're a man,"" he said nervously. Dunham's character explained what Planned Parenthood was to Marisol and she quickly changed her mind about her boyfriend.In a spoof scene of the political TV drama “Scandal,” Sasheer Zamata played Olivia Pope, who instructed her team of ""gladiators"" to solve the newest crisis as fast as possible. Dunham's character Kelsey, was tasked with placing a bug on the Mexican ambassador’s wife but felt overwhelemed by the intense environment.“You just talked so fast I literally have a thousand follow up questions,” Kelsey told Olivia.In a dramatic scene, President Fitzgerald Grant entered Olivia's office and  professed his love to her. But Olivia ignored him, focusing on her work. Kelsey couldn’t believe what she was seeing.“That was the President of the United States, how are you not texting like a thousand people right now?” she asked.In the cold open scene President Obama (Jay Pharoah) addressed the United States regarding the Russia's standoff over Ukraine's southern region of Crimea. He said, since Crimean lawmakers have voted to hold a referendum that would decide on whether to leave Ukraine, ""I've heard so many questions from the American people, like 'is this the first step towards war? What can the United States do? And hold up, what's Crimea?'"" Obama explained that he's taken steps to end the crisis, and specifically mentioned his hour-long conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.""I told him that one country can't violate international law by invading another country. And he spent the rest of our conversation by pretending to sneeze while loudly saying 'Iraq'!""The president admitted that Putin was acting tough and that now, desperate times call for desperate measures.""So I called in a friend,"" he said, as actor Liam Neeson entered the scene. ""Crimea has been taken,"" said Neeson. ""I hate it when things are taken,"" referencing his 2008 movie ""Taken.""“Weekend Update"" also poked fun at Obama's icy relationship with Putin.“President Obama this week warned President Vladimir Putin who had sent warships to Crimea that he’s on ‘the wrong side of history,’” reported Cecily Strong. “Pretty strong words for a guy who uses a Blackberry.""In light of Sunday’s season finale of HBO's “True Detective” series, co-anchor Colin Jost introduced Matthew McConaughey (Taran Killam) to discuss his time on the show.When Jost congratulated McConaughey on his recent Oscar win for “Dallas Buyers Club,” the actor said – similar to his ambiguous Oscars acceptance speech --  “Don’t congratulate me, congratulate the man I was a week ago, congratulate the man I’m chasing, congratulate the man who never existed.”“And who’s that?” asked Colin.“That’s me,” said McConaughey who continued to answer Jost’s questions with other questions and unclear metaphors. He also referred to Jost as Co-Jo.Grammy Award winning band The National performed ""Graceless,"" and ""I Need My Girl."" ""Saturday Night Live"" will return March 29 with Louis C.K. as host.

977	With Lena Dunham hosting the show, there was no way 'SNL' wasn't going to do some kind of 'Girls' parody. And with the recent release of 'Son of God' and the impending arrival of 'Noah,' there was no way the show wasn't going to take a shot at the recent biblical movie revival. So here we are, with a hilarious fake trailer for 'Girl,' which simultaneously skewers the story of Adam and Even and your average episode of HBO's 'Girls.'The sketch should be funny to just about everyone, but it'll be especially funny to people who are familiar with Dunham's work as a writer and actor. Her Eve is just like her Hannah: selfish, neurotic and completely unable to take care of herself (she even complains to God that she doesn't have health insurance). Taran Killiam shows up as well, breaking out an Adam Driver impression that's nothing less than perfect, capturing the Adam/Hannah dynamic. The weirdest joke involves Vanessa Bayer playing Zosia Mamet's Shoshana as a talking snake.Usually, 'SNL' fake trailers are one joke told very well. But you know what? We'd watch two hours of Hannah, Adam and Snake Shoshana wandering about the Garden of Eden.Get our Newsletter	Entertainment
978	"Critics of the HBO show “Girls” may not have found a lot to love about “Saturday Night Live” last night, as the show’s creator and star Lena Dunham hosted and tapped into the good-natured obliviousness and awkwardness of her character Hannah Horvath (or somebody who looks and sounds a lot like her) for a majority of the sketches. Fans of Dunham, though, may have found a lot to enjoy about the show, as she threw herself into her scenes and proved she has a comic sense of timing and capability beyond the gawky moments that make up “Girls.”The best intersection of Dunham's signature character and funny writing was in ""Scandal,"" where Dunham played a new girl who can't stop marveling over how ridiculously attractive and efficient everyone on the show is. Instead of making Dunham the butt of the joke by making her seem inadequate for not traveling to Mexico and back in ten minutes, she portrayed the actual humans who watch ""Scandal,"" saying things like ""How are you not texting 1,000 people right now?"" as Olivia Pope (played by Sasheer Zamata) conversed with her boyfriend, the president (Taran Killam). A bonus about the sketch was that it was still funny and understandable to those who don't watch ""Scandal.""In contrast, an actual ""Girls"" parody seemed to be missing something. In this particular version, the show takes place in the Garden of Eden, poking fun at Dunham's frequent nudity on the show but otherwise the sketch rehashed the ""Girls"" parody from the Tina Fey episode, down to Vanessa Bayer as Shoshanna and Taran Killam as Adam (in this case, a double Adam.)Speaking of Taran Killam, homage must be paid to his spot-on Matthew McConaughey impression during ""Weekend Update."" In honor of the actor’s Oscar win and the season finale of “True Detective,” Killam nailed McConaughey’s good-spirited loopiness, homespun mysticism and verbal jazz. Perhaps in a future episode we can watch McConaughey face off (get it?) in a future ""Update"" against Nicolas Cage.Back to Dunham: one sketch that had promise but unfortunately didn't grow in the right direction was one where Mike O'Brien is the only man at a jewelry party and, to top it off, he's a men's rights activist. O'Brien is quickly shamed and humiliated by the women at his party as well as by his sexy Sofia Vergara-type girlfriend, played by Cecily Strong. However, the scene didn't quite take off, partially because it wasn't clear how much Strong's language barrier was supposed to be a joke in and of itself and also because a men's rights activist who is instantly neutered by a group of intelligent women was missing a certain bite, especially when one considers the types of messages men's rights activist bloggers post online (if you're not familiar, spare yourself.) The concept was good but the scene needed some more left turns.Dunham did show off one skill that she doesn’t often get to on her own show: her sense of rhythm. In “Ooh Child,” Dunham was one of a group of friends participating in a car singalong to the Five Stairsteps song, only each time her part came up, she was interrupted by the talking GPS system (a concept that looked simple onscreen but probably involved some tricky timing and rehearsing.) In “What’s Poppin’,” Dunham, Aidy Bryant, Cecily Strong and Mike O’Brien played a group of flowing-robed hippie jazz musicians blissfully performing their interpretation of rap music on a hip hop show (lines included “We love rap. We love rap,” and  “This is an example of a great rap.”)Speaking of great rappers, two actors who are not known for rapping made unexpected cameos in the episode. Liam Neeson stopped by the cold open to assist Jay Pharoah’s President Obama with the Ukraine/Russia situation by spinning it as a mix of Neeson’s “Taken” movies and a Chuck Norris project. Later in the episode, Jon Hamm stopped by “What Are You Even Doing? You’re Crazy” (a “Girlfriends”-type talk show about middle-graders), the best part being that he actually played Jon Hamm dropping by a middle-grade girls’ talk show. No explanation was ever given why he was in the scene, as himself, and Hamm seemed panicked that any moment he’d get in trouble for being there, and the weirdness of it all worked.“SNL” will be taking next week off but will return March 29 with Louis C.K. as host and possibly also musical guest (none has been announced so far.) Is this the start of his rapping career?ALSO:New Girl, 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine,' 'Mindy Project,' 'Following' renewedToo many white men creating the shows at HBO, TV critic saysFred Armisen bangs the drum loudly for 'Portlandia' and Seth MeyersTwitter: @Zulkey"	Entertainment
979	Lena Dunham took a crack at the story of the Garden of Eden on Saturday Night Live, and true to form she was naked through the entire skit!The creator and star of the hit series, Girls, Dunham parodied how often she’s undressed in her HBO show and got SNL regular Taran Killam (as Girls costar Adam Driver) to go along for the fun.“Adam, a snake just talked to me.  Is that normal?” Dunham, as Eve, asks her mate.And after having consumed several apples, she asks for forgiveness for having committed “original sin because at least it was original.”The sketch was definitely original and definitely funny.	Entertainment
980	"  ""Saturday Night Live"" got the ""Girls"" treatment this week.Former cast member Fred Armisen and two perfectly executed guest cameos from Liam Neeson and Jon Hamm turned a passable guest host turn from ""Girls"" creator Lena Dunham into an excellent one.Neeson appeared in the cold open, threatening Russian President Vladimir Putin with his familiar ""I have a particular set of skills"" line from ""Taken."" In an ordinary ""SNL"" sketch, that would have been the entire joke, but the scene went on as he continued to speak to Putin ""in a language you can understand.""What followed was a '80s-style action star montage featuring Jay Pharoah's President Obama shirtless on a horse, karate chopping a guy in a gi, and wrestling a bear. It was a pitch-perfect sketch that was both silly and sharply satirical.Hamm played himself in a strange character-based talk show sketch, ""What Are You Even Doing? You're Being Crazy"" centered around two middle school girls who ""both hit puberty, like, three hours ago."" Brendell and Marissa (Dunham and Noel Wells) attempt to flirt with a boy (Kyle Mooney) with predictably awkward results.But then, inexplicably, Jon Hamm showed up as a guest and the absurdity of the situation heightened the otherwise normal behavior of the girls while the discomfort of Hamm — understandably worried that ""Is this, like, a 'Dateline' Chris Hansen thing?"" — turned into greatness. Individually, the sketch and the cameo could have fallen flat; together, they were magical.Armisen appeared on Weekend Update with Vanessa Bayer as Putin's Best Friends From Growing Up, which was a lot of fun, but also a little out of place. The subtle gag of two gossipy friends who lower their voices when they say catty things about their absent friend Putin seems like a better fit for ""Portlandia"" than ""SNL,"" especially for a Weekend Update segment that plays better with big characters that are too cartoony for a regular scenic sketch.OPENING MONOLOGUE:Dunham played a great straight man opposite the cast of Vanessa Bayer, Aidy Bryant, and Bobby Moynihan as they came up and shared too much information about their sex lives. The skit is capped off with Kate McKinnon (criminally underused this week) as Dunham's grandmother, who bragged about being so promiscuous in her youth that she ""was practically a third base coach.""BUZZIEST SKETCH:This has to be ""SNL's"" swipe at the hit ABC drama ""Scandal,"" with Dunham as an eager new hire who's in way over her head at Pope & Associates. Sasheer Zamata makes a great Olivia Pope (in a ""phenomenally tailored"" white pantsuit, natch), and the befuddlement of Dunham's character really played up the absurdity of the show. Yeah, where did that picture come from?BEST USE OF GUEST:It's been a while since we've seen a guest directly parody their work; Jim Parsons didn't do a ""Big Bang Theory"" sketch last week, and Melissa McCarthy's ""Mike and Molly"" doesn't really lend itself to parody. So it was nice to see Dunham play her ""Girls"" character in a Biblical version of the show set in the Garden of Eden. Between the nudity and her boyfriend's name being Adam, the sketch practically writes itself.LEAST EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MOST CELEBRITY IMPERSONATIONS:""Pimpin' Pimpin' Pimpin' with Katt Williams: Oscar Edition"" is a flimsy excuse to see Pharaoh's great Katt Williams impersonation, Dunham's fantastic Liza Minnelli, Killam's passable Harrison Ford, Brooks Wheelan's unnecessary Jared Leto, and Wells's goofy Lena Dunham. But as flimsy excuses go, this one's pretty great.MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF THE LEAST CELEBRITY IMPERSONATIONS:""What's Poppin'"" with Pharoah and Kenan Thompson as Lil' Taint Anthony and LeGod Williams is a hip-hop show whose last-minute guests turn out to be the sort of painfully square musical group that visits junior high schools to lead inspirational assemblies. Dunham and Cecily Strong must surely rank amongst the best worst rappers of all time, and if you look up ""the opposite of hip-hop"" in the encyclopedia, you'll probably see Bryant as a flute player.It's a simple idea that's been done a thousand times, but it doesn't need to be original when it's done this well. Also, if ""Choo choo ch-booch / This is an example of great rap!"" isn't rolling around your head days from now, you're probably part of a painfully square musical group that visits junior high schools to lead inspirational assemblies, and we're sorry for that.BEST OF THE REST:Killam as Matthew McConaughey, leading the entire audience in a weird rhythmic humming that turned out to be the theme song to ""Inspector Gadget.""""But it's OK, because we gonna find some massive guys!""""I'm sorta looking at Ryan right now. He doesn't look like himself. He's kinda more like a bird/fish, I'd say, type guy?""""I was told there would be pizza.""Check out more ""Saturday Night Live"" videos on Yahoo Screen.Mark H: Damn, and he did it during BLACK HISTORY MONTH too!924"	Entertainment
981	"She may be rocking a pants suit, but Lena Dunham proved she would make a horrible Gladiator on Scandal. The March 8 Saturday Night Live host worked alongside Olivia Pope and associates in a Scandal sketch where new SNL star Sasheer Zamata played Kerry Washington&apos;s lead role as the Washington D.C. fixer. 

				PHOTOS: Olivia Pope's best looks ever			
Dunham, 27, played Kelsey, the newest member of the Gladiator team, who had plenty of questions for her powerful boss. After Pope asked her to fly to Mexico and place a bug on the ambassador&apos;s wife, Kelsey asked who was buying the plane ticket, and if she should bring a swimsuit, in case her hotel had a pool. Pope ignored the questions, insisting Kelsey head to a ball to plant the bug. ""Not to be a whatever, but if it&apos;s a ball, maybe you should go instead of me,"" Kelsey said. ""Just saying, you&apos;re a stunning black woman in a phenomenally-tailored white pants suit, and these are the fanciest clothes I own.""

				PHOTOS: Get Olivia Pope's Scandal style for less			
After Taran Killam appeared as President Fitzgerald Grant and shared an intimate moment with Pope, Kelsey quickly quipped, ""Ummm, ok! That was President of the United States. How are you not texting like a thousand people right now? I wish my dating problems were that the guy was the president.""Ultimately, Kelsey didn&apos;t quite cut it as a Gladiator, declaring, ""Olivia, I feel like you walk faster than I run, even though you&apos;re always dressed for a formal wedding. No offense, but I&apos;m actually going to go, but I want you all to know that you&apos;re the most beautiful and ethnically diverse people I&apos;ve seen in one room, and you should be really proud of that.""

				PHOTOS: Stars' funniest SNL moments			
The first-time host appeared in a series of sketches including one where she played an entirely nude Eve, telling an unconventional version of the Adam and Eve story and another were she played a horny middle schooler co-hosting the talk show What Are You Even Doing? with special guest Jon Hamm. Watch the Scandal sketch above!

Breaking News!


Lena Dunham stripped off for her Saturday Night Live hosting debut last night (March 8).The Girls star appeared nude in a spoof biblical movie trailer, telling the story of Adam and Eve in the style of the HBO show.Dunham took the role of Eve - a ""struggling 20-something in the Garden of Eden"" - while SNL's Taran Killam appeared as the actress's co-star Adam Driver, as Adam.The parody sees a confused Eve struggle to clarify God's rules when he tells the pair not to eat the forbidden fruit.""Are you saying that like, 'I suggest you don't' or like a 'definitely don't but with a side of maybe do'?"" she asks.The actress referenced her frequent nudity in Girls earlier on in the show during her opening monologue.""If you're nervous about giving a speech, just picture the audience naked,"" she joked. ""Or at least imagine that your audience hasn't seen you naked.""
Dunham then revealed that her sex scenes in the HBO comedy often mean that members of the public tell her sordid details about their sex lives, only to have the SNL cast regale her with tales of their x-rated exploits.Elsewhere in the show, Liam Neeson made a cameo as his Taken character and Jon Hamm appeared in a sketch titled 'What Are You Even Doing, You're Being Crazy'.Musical guest The National entertained the audience with performances of 'Graceless' and 'I Need My Girl'.Louis CK will host SNL for the second time when it returns on March 29 after a two-week hiatus.PREVIOUS ARTICLENEXT ARTICLE

She's the voice of her generation (or at least a voice, of a generation). For better or worse, Lena Dunham is everywhere -  and this weekend, she stepped into one of comedy's most high-profile gigs as the host of Saturday Night Live.  In many ways, Dunham is a wise and easy choice, given the show's current growing pains - her episode was the second since the departure of long-time head writer Seth Meyers - and Dunham's all-time high profile. Her hit HBO show Girls is in its third season, and her character Hannah Horvath has come to represent the self-focused angst of many a millennial. So did Dunham deliver? Overall, she was a confident host, who did as much as she could with fairly weak material. The best of it played to her strengths - a goofy send-up of Scandal, in which her character was Hannah in a wig, calling Sasheer Zamata's Olivia Pope on her impossible, rapid-fire instructions (""You just talked so fast, and I have literally a thousand follow-up questions""). There was also a great Adam and Eve short, with Dunham's Hannah character stepping in for Eve - and everyone's favourite Girls character, Shoshanna (played to perfection by Vanessa Bayer) showing up as the Snake. The show's highs were high, though Dunham didn't step far outside of her comfort zone. But the lows were quite dismally low - the very bizarre Jewelry Party, in which a men's rights advocate is the only male guest; and the old and tired talk show in the basement concept that totally misused guest star Jon Hamm. The show's best moment didn't involve Dunham at all; Taran Killam's pitch-perfect Matthew McConaughey impression during the Weekend Update segment brought the house down, and proved that Killam is easily this season's strongest cast member.All in all, it was a mostly watchable turn from a great talent, but it was further proof that SNL's own voice-of-a-generation days are long gone. Here's a skit-by-skit recap:Follow us on Twitter: @globeandmail

987	"Lena Dunham and Adam Driver in the Garden of Eden; a newbie on Scandal; cameos by Liam Neeson, Jon Hamm, and Fred Armisen; and more...The show rebounded this week with an episode in which Lena Dunham sang, danced, got naked, and took on roles ranging from Liza Minnelli to herself as Girls's Hannah. Liam Neeson, Jon Hamm, and Fred Armisen made cameos. Musical guest The National performed ""Graceless"" and ""I Need My Girl.""Some highlights...
In the vein of Noah and Son of God ... coming soon: Girl, starring Lena Dunham and Adam Driver (Taran Killam) as Adam and Eve. (""Can you please not apple-shame me? I know I committed original sin, but at least it's original. I think I deserve some credit for that—or at least a publishing deal..."")
 Ooh Child—a carpool-singalong/vigilante murder sketch.
 Scandal's Olivia Pope (Sasheer Zamata) has a new, confused employee. (With Taran Killam as Fitz, Jay Pharoah as Harrison, Beck Bennett as Huck, Cecily Strong as Quinn, Kate McKinnon as Abby, and Lena Dunham as befuddled newcomer Kelsey.)
 Cold open—Obama teams up with Liam Neeson for a special message to Vladimir Putin. (""Recently I had a very disturbing call. Crimea had been taken..."")
 Katt Williams (a spot-on Jay Pharoah) talks Oscars with Jared Leto (Brooks Whelan), Liza Minnelli (Lena Dunham), an addled Harrison Ford (Taran Killam), and Lena Dunham (Noël Wells).
 Also: An incoherently pseudo-profound Matthew McConaughey (Taran Killam) drops by Weekend Update to discuss his Oscar win.NEXT, on March 29: Louis C.K. (Musical guest as yet unannounced).
    From the Mayan ballgame Pitz to ancient Greece’s bull-leaping, here’s a tour of the history of athletic games.
In the mid-1930s, the Federal Writers’ Project interviewed thousands of former slaves, some of whom claimed the president came to their plantations disguised as a beggar or a peddler, telling them they’d soon be free.Shortly before the election of 1860, a man came upon a plantation near Marlin, Texas, some 20 miles southeast of Waco. Though nobody knew who he was, the plantation owner took him in as a guest. The stranger paid close attention to how the enslaved people working on the plantation were treated—how they subsisted on a weekly ration of “four pounds of meat and a peck of meal,” how they were whipped and sometimes sold, resulting in the tearing apart of families. Eventually, the stranger said goodbye and went on his way, but a little while later he wrote a letter to the plantation owner, informing him he would soon have to free his slaves—“that everybody was going to have to, that the North was going to see to it.” The stranger told the owner to go into the room where he’d slept, and see where he’d carved his name into the headrest. And when the slaveholder went and looked, he saw the name: “A. Lincoln.”Lawmakers scoffed at the president’s calls to slash funding across the government a year ago. With a new spending deal now in place, they’re likely to do so again.Within the thousands of pages the White House transmitted to Congress on Monday morning as part of President Trump’s second annual budget request, there is a line that pretty much sums up the whole ritual.“Many of the eliminations and reductions in this volume reflect a continuation of policies proposed in the 2018 President’s Budget that have not yet been enacted
by the Congress,” the sentence reads. It’s included in the introduction of a 222-page document titled “Major Savings and Reforms.”Those are all the cuts the Trump administration is proposing, and they’re going nowhere.Trump again wants to take a meat cleaver to the Environmental Protection Agency, chopping its budget by one-third. He’s asking Congress to scrap entirely community-development block grants and heating assistance for low-income housing. And he wants to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the national endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, and a slew of other independent agencies.The fumbling of domestic-violence accusations against Rob Porter is a story about the administration’s inability to tell the truth, not its disorganization.The White House’s response to allegations of domestic violence against former Staff Secretary Rob Porter has so stunned reporters that the whole episode has become an exemplar of the total disorganization of the Trump administration.“Abuse Case Exposes Fissures in a White House in Turmoil,” The New York Times intones. Axios’s Jonathan Swan writes, “This is crazy. Even in a White House that’s famous for chaos, I’ve never seen anything like this.” Politico’s Playbook simply announced, “CHAOS at 1600 Pennsylvania.”This is peculiar, not only because it is difficult to imagine what would rise to the level of notable chaos relative to the standards of this White House. It’s strange because the focus on disorder has overshadowed the more salient feature of the moment: Insofar as the administration is engulfed in chaos, it is a result of its inability to tell the truth. The Trump team doesn’t have a chaos problem so much as it has a dishonesty problem. Of course this is not new, either—in fact, the serial dissembling of the White House has become so banal that it goes almost unremarked in this case—yet it is on particularly dramatic display here.Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald rose to the occasion with their paintings of the former president and first lady, while—importantly—continuing their radical projects in black portraiture.Jasmine, African blue lilies, and Chicago’s favorite flower, chrysanthemum, flourish in the botanical backdrop of President Barack Obama’s official portrait. The 44th president appears seated in an ornate chair, with leafy vines threatening to climb up his pant leg.In her official portrait, First Lady Michelle Obama appears seated, too, in a flowing dress designed by Milly. Between her gown, with its touches of geometric patterning, and the sky-blue paint that frames her figure, the painting features a lot of hard-edged abstraction.On Monday, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled the Obamas’ official portraits. President Obama’s portrait, by the Los Angeles–born and New York–based artist Kehinde Wiley, will join the museum’s hall of American presidents, where it will permanently disrupt the march of white presidential paintings. The portrait of Michelle Obama, the work of Baltimore’s Amy Sherald, will be on view with recent acquisitions through November 2018.From Donald Trump to recent op-eds, the male perspective remains—stubbornly, perniciously—the default point of view.The tweet, as so often happens, was at once shocking and deeply predictable.Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused—life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?That was President Trump, on Saturday, ostensibly reacting to the fact that, this week, allegations of domestic abuse led to the resignations of two high-level staffers at the White House. He was also, obliquely, weighing in on #MeToo. The president’s 48-word assessment of the reckoning so many Americans are painfully but productively engaged in made for rich (but thoroughly unsurprising) irony: Trump, of course, has been accused of sexual impropriety by 19 women—and has also been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault, and has also boasted, on national television, about advising friends to “be rougher” toward their wives, and has also been elected president of the United States. His tweet is revealing both in spite and because of those facts: “Peoples[sic],” in the plural; allegation, in the singular. The peoples meaning the “men’s”; the allegation—though in its context, the diminishing adjective is redundant—being a “mere” one.Digital stardust won’t magically make future cities more affordable or resilient.The term “smart city” is interesting yet not important, because nobody defines it. “Smart” is a snazzy political label used by a modern alliance of leftist urbanites and tech industrialists. To deem yourself “smart” is to make the NIMBYites and market-force people look stupid.Smart-city devotees all over this world will agree that London is particularly smart. Why? London is a huge, ungainly beast whose cartwheeling urban life is in cranky, irrational disarray. London is a god-awful urban mess, but London does have some of the best international smart-city conferences.London also has a large urban-management bureaucracy who emit the proper smart-city buzzwords and have even invented some themselves.  The language of Smart City is always Global Business English, no matter what town you're in.The president’s budget proposal has some troubling news for the space agency’s next big astronomy mission.The Trump administration has released its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 and put dozens of federal programs on the chopping block, including a brand-new NASA space telescope that scientists say would provide the biggest picture of the universe yet, with the same sparkling clarity as the Hubble Space Telescope.The proposal, released Monday, recommends eliminating the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), citing “higher priorities” at NASA and the cost of the new telescope.“Given competing priorities at NASA, and budget constraints, developing another large space telescope immediately after completing the $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope is not a priority for the administration,” the proposal states. “The budget proposes to terminate WFIRST and redirect existing funds to other priorities of the science community, including completed astrophysics missions and research.”Images of Carnival season 2018, already underway, with celebrations in Brazil, Portugal, Hungary, Bolivia, Haiti, Spain, Italy, and more.Carnival season 2018 is underway across Europe and the Americas. These pre-Lent festivals, often a blend of local pagan and Catholic traditions, usher out winter and welcome in spring. The largest and most famous—the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil—took place over the past few days.  Gathered here are images of Carnivals around the world, including images from Brazil, Portugal, Hungary, Bolivia, Haiti, Spain, Italy, and more. Depending on available photos, there may be a follow-up post later this week with more from Mardi Gras and other celebrations.The surprise release of The Cloverfield Paradox, along with acquisitions of other schlocky genre movies, suggests the company is leaning in to its “direct-to-video” approach.Just a year ago, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Netflix was a big player. The streaming company was a little more than a year into releasing its own original movies for its subscribers, and it was looking for prestige hits to gain a foothold as a distributor Hollywood could take seriously. It acquired one of the best-reviewed films of the festival, Mudbound, for $12.5 million, and the Grand Jury Prize winner I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, among others. In terms of prestige, Netflix was lagging behind its competitor Amazon, which had nabbed a Best Picture nomination for its major Sundance acquisition of 2016, Manchester by the Sea. Maybe Netflix’s new slate of indie favorites would turn things around.Republican lawmakers are increasingly showing disdain for decisions made by the judicial branch—and by extension the rule of law.An old legal anecdote—attributed to such legal notables as Mae West and the Earl of Birkenhead—depicts a frustrated judge asking an obstreperous lawyer, “Are you displaying contempt of court?”“No, your honor,” the advocate responds. “I am trying to conceal it.”I sometimes think simple politeness—a willingness to conceal contempt for other parties, judges, and even law itself—is all that differentiates true lawyers from thugs in contrast-collar shirts. But like other areas of public etiquette, this habitual courtesy is showing strain in the era of Donald Trump.Trump likes to denounce and threaten courts that thwart his will. But the political threat to courts did not begin with Trump and will not end when he is gone. It is part of a civic rot that is eating at the vitals of our democracy, and it is getting worse.In a StoryCorps animation, Patrick Haggerty remembers the remarkable advice he got from his dairy farmer dad.Lucius Zafalon is a daredevil motorcycle rider who risks his body in the pursuit of the perfect Globe of Death act.It’s an incredible story.

Lena Dunham brought nudity, Scandal and more Girls to Saturday Night Live.The show's money shot came when the first-time host debuted Girl, a spiritual sequel to SNL's much-loved Girls parody from last year's season opener. In Girl, Dunham and Girls costar Adam Driver (Taran Killam) told the story of Adam and Eve -- Lena Dunham style.PHOTOS: 'Saturday Night Live': 10 Stars You Forgot Were CastmembersDunam's Eve pestered Adam to define their relationship (""are we like, man and wife?"") and became angry on feminist grounds when he reassured her that she was part of him (""Literally. God made you from my rib, kid.""). Vanessa Bayer reprised her role as Shoshanna, playing the snake in the Garden of Eden story and convincing Eve to eat the infamous apple.Eve's response when God scolded her for the sin?""Can you please not apple shame me right now? Seriously, I know I committed original sin, but at least it's original.""SNL totally hit it out of the park with its cold open, where Liam Neeson made a surprise appearance as himself to help President Obama (Jay Pharoah) condemn Russian  President Vladimir Putin for moving troops into Crimea.PHOTOS: From Live TV to the Big Screen: 12 'SNL' Sketches Made Into Movies""Recently, I got a very disturbing call. Crimea had been taken. I hate it when things are taken,"" Neeson said, before speaking into the camera to address Putin directly.""Mr. Putin. Vladimir. I've never met you. I don't have experience in international diplomacy. But what I do have is a very particular set of skills. Skills that would make me a nightmare for someone like you,"" Neeson said, channeling his Taken character. ""By which I mean I'm an actor. In Hollywood. With a lot of connections.""New castmember Sasheer Zamata had her biggest role on SNL yet, playing Kerry Washington's Scandal character Olivia Pope -- an interesting choice as Washington helped SNL mock the show's lack of diversity back in November.In the sketch, Olivia assigned impossibly difficult tasks to her team -- who all were unfazed by the demands. That's except for the newest member (Dunham), who got hung up on the logistics and asked endless questions about how they were going to accomplish these impossible tasks.Dunham's opening monologue got really awkward when castmembers -- emboldened by her racy HBO show -- kept wanting to tell her about their sex lives.SNL also had plenty of fun with the Oscars, with Killam playing newly crowned best actor winner Matthew McConaughey. Wearing a white tux, McConaughey spoke in gibberish in the style of his much-talked-about Oscars speech: ""Don't congratulate me. Congratulate the man I was a week ago. Congratulate the man I'm chasing. Congratulate the man who never existed.""  Later, Pharoah starred in Pimpin' Pimpin' Pimpin With Katt Williams, where the 4/20 friendly comedian welcomed Liza Minnelli (Dunham) to ask "" How did you not whoop Ellen's ass?"" when the Oscars host joked she was a transvestite, and to tell Harrison Ford (Killam) the actor's earring really wasn't working for him: ""Seeing Indiana Jones with an earring is like seeing Darth Vader in Uggs."" The kicker? Noel Wells reprised her role as Dunham.The episode also saw cameos from Fred Armisen (playing one of Putin's friends growing up) and Jon Hamm as the guest on a teen girls talk show.﻿SNL is taking a few weeks off, but returns March 29 with host Louis. C.K. SNL airs at 11:30 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.Email: Aaron.Couch@THR.com

	Saturday Night Live this week included a skit that portrayed people who shut down Planned Parenthood Clinics as bad men who had their heart broken by some girl when they were 18 and never got over it.

	During the skit, protesting against Planned Parenthood was used as an example of how out of touch a dorky guy was. The actor, with slicked down hair and an emphasized nasal voice, argued that men deserve to be paid more than women always, before his proud (but unaware) girlfriend proudly volunteered that he had helped to shut down two Planned Parenthood clinics. (Video below)
	This week's SNL episode was hosted by Lena Dunham, the controversial feminist star of HBO's ""Girls."" After it was revealed that the boyfriend had helped force the clinics to close, Dunham had to pause and say that she was ""so upset right now"" before informing the girlfriend that Planned Parenthood helped women get ""low-cost medical advice and care."" The girlfriend then admitted that her boyfriend was ""not the best guy.""

	At the end of the skit, the boyfriend was dumped amid thunderous applause.
	Planned Parenthood is America's largest abortion provider, performing over 300,000 abortions per year. According to its annual report, Planned Parenthood of Indiana performed 5,580 abortions in 2010.

992	 Spoilers Lena Dunham, Saturday Night Live 0 Comment March 8, 2014Tonight marks what is to us one of the most interesting episodes of “Saturday Night Live” of this entire season. Not only do you have a show in desperate need of a comeback after stinking up the joint with Jim Parsons as the host last week, but you have someone on board this time in Lena Dunham who is certainly polarizing … to say the least.What Lena does bring to the table is creativity, and that may have helped significantly when it comes to pitching ideas and sketches in the writers’ room. She’s also very good at playing a few particular types of characters, mostly of that weird, quirky, and self-involved variety. Hannah Horvath is that woman from “Girls” who is easy to relate to, but also easy to hate because she represents what is the worst in so many of us.On the flip side, what makes this risky is that it’s hard to say just how many other characters Lena can pull off. This is not an expression of doubt so much as it is an admission that we really have not seen her play very many other things over the years. There are also so many people who have their minds made up about what sort of talent she is that she may have a difficult time changing that perception about her.For the time being, we’re willing to give Lena the benefit of the doubt. She is, after all, reasonably funny in the promos below with Kate McKinnon and Taran Killam, and she also has no problem seemingly skewering the fact that sometimes, her own character on “Girls” is in the buff for no particular reason.What do you think is going to happen on this weekend’s show? Share your predictions below! We’ve got a lot coming up tonight for you to enjoy, whether it be a full review of this show, or a podcast after the fact with Jason Prager. Bookmark the link here, since that is our “SNL” central. We’ll have everything for you there overnight.

        Lena Dunham tells it like it is and Hannah Horvath says the darndest things. Dunham has been putting words into the mouth of her ""Girls"" character for three seasons and this weekend, as the host of ""Saturday Night Live,"" she's bound to perform in skits inspired by both personas.
      
        If you've watched enough of the HBO series or read Dunham's interviews or Twitter musings, you might think you can tell the two apart. You might be wrong — they're pretty much the same person. But you should totally try anyway, with this quiz, using real quotes.
      
        Who's said it — Lena or Hannah?

1. ""I don't want to freak you out, but I think I may be the voice of my generation.""

2. ""If you're not into me, that's your problem, and you're going to have to kind of work that out with whatever professionals you've hired.""
      
3. ""I'd been like, 'If I never date again in my whole life, I'll be fine with it! I want to work and rescue rabbits and be a notable eccentric!'""
      
4. ""The worst stuff that you say sounds better than the best stuff that some other people say.""

5. ""I am 13 pounds overweight and it has been awful for me my whole life.""
      
6. ""Sexuality isn't a perfect puzzle, like, 'He has a nice nose and she has a nice nose! She's got great breasts and he's got great calves! And so they're going to live happily ever after in a house that was purchased with their modeling money!' It's a complicated thing.""
      
7. ""Any mean thing someone’s gonna think of to say about me, I’ve already said to me, about me, probably in the last half hour.""
      
8. ""I always say that you can divide the world into two kinds of women: those who are attracted to Adam and those who aren’t.""
      
9. ""I used to come home from school and just sit and eat cheesy popcorn and watch ‘Singled Out,’ and I don’t know how I ever thought things could get better than that.""

10. ""I can never tell if guys are attractive in a loserly way or if they’re just losers.""
      
11. ""I think I just feel how everyone feels — which is I have three or four really great folk albums in me.""
      
12. ""Gosh, boys get so mad when you use words they don't know.""
      
        In case you missed it, check out Dunham's interview with Savannah Guthrie on TODAY. And tune into ""SNL"" Saturday at 11:35 p.m. on NBC.
      
Oh! The answers ...

Lena Dunham is hosting Saturday Night Live this week, but the Girls star and creator has already gotten the SNL treatment.Her HBO show was memorably spoofed during the September season premiere, with Tina Fey playing a fifth castmember, the Albanian Blerta, who responded to Hannah Horvath and company's complaints with far more dire problems.VIDEO: Lena Dunham Mocks 'Girls' Nudity in 'SNL' PromosNot only wasn't Dunham offended, but she also called the parody ""a smart approach.""""It was one of the best things that's ever happened to me,"" Dunham said of the spoof in an interview that aired on Friday's Today. ""I was sitting there watching that, and I couldn't believe these people that I admired were even aware enough of my work to sort of construct this parody, which felt loving. I've always been all too aware that there are things to be made fun of in the show, and I thought they took such a smart approach.""She added that she appreciated that the jokes weren't about her weight or frequent nudity on the show.""It wasn't nudity obsessed; it wasn't, you know, all about my weight,"" Dunham said. ""It was a really intelligent, thoughtful approach to Girls. So not only did I feel grateful that I was spared, I felt excited it existed.""VIDEO: Lena Dunham Was Detained at Airport for Self-Defense Cat KeychainOn Saturday, Dunham will be even more of a part of SNL's sketches, and as she prepares to host, the SNL superfan is taking it all in.""I love [SNL] with a passion,"" she said. "" 'Obsessed' is not too strong of a word, and being here in this space is surreal and wonderful, and I just am so excited to soak up every inch of it. I was literally, like, staring at the hairstylists as they constructed wigs today, saying, 'I want to learn your secrets.' ""Dunham even said she asked Late Night host and former SNL star Seth Meyers for advice, with Meyers saying that she shouldn't offer more than three ideas for sketches.She then prepared a few ideas for sketches and shared them with her boyfriend, fun.'s Jack Antonoff. But they decided her ideas weren't yet ready for late night.STORY: Lena Dunham Responds to Jezebel's Unretouched Vogue Photos""I pitched a couple of them to my boyfriend,"" Dunham said. ""He was like, 'Those are … I think you should keep them in our house.' ""That also seemed to be the case for Today host Savannah Guthrie's pitch to join the cast of the HBO show as the fifth Girl.Guthrie presented a few storyboards, showing how she could contribute to the show as Hannah's responsible friend, including helping her study for the bar exam ""because I don't think she's achieving her potential,"" Guthrie said.""I'll take it back to the writer's room and we'll … give it serious consideration,"" Dunham said, laughing.Watch the full interview below.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy

996	You can listen to music on Toblerones now?Quite possibly. We haven't had the pleasure of munching away on a duty free slab of Swiss chocolate for a while now, but either way, you're off the mark. This is music legend Neil Young's weapon in the crusade against low quality audio: the PonoPlayer.So… it's an iPod?It's a dedicated music player, yes, but unlike the iPod (or smartphones for that matter), it's designed to provide studio-quality music at the highest fidelity possible.So it'll make my music sound better?Not quite. It's designed to work with the upcoming PonoMusic service which will let users download Hi-Res albums from both major and independent labels. Your standard mp3s and headphones will still - in the words of many an audiophile - sound like tinny garbage.READ MORE: Neil Young shows off Pono audiophile music playerBut I'm perfectly happy listening to Avicii on my Dr Dre ear goggles…And you're exactly the type of person Mr Young is hoping to convert. Once your ears see (well, hear) the light then you'll be so blown away that you'll never touch a dirty MP3 file ever again.Sounds… expensive. And heavy on memoryYou do pay for quality with larger file sizes, but the 128GB Pono will store between 100-500 albums of hi-res music, and it's got expandable storage for even more flexibility.As for the price? US$400 (£240) on Kickstarter. Not exactly cheap then, but once you've tasted the sweet highs and deep, beautifully balanced bass drops of a high-res album, your ears won't want to go back. The project will launch later this week.READ MORE: Why you should be pumped about (and just a little bit sceptical of) Hi-Res AudioLISTEN UP – FOR MORE HOT STUFF, CLICK RIGHT HERE	Entertainment

I've also noticed that he uses his money and fame beyond the music world as an inventor, often tackling ideas such as electric cars and the battle with music piracy.He was behind the creation of a luxury-series hybrid electric car powered by biomass, and most recently has been putting his clout behind Pono, the digital-to-analog music service he's set to introduce this week at SXSW in Austin.He drives poetic notions of rock-and-roll freedom into everything that he says, such as his vivacious message while recently accepting the President's Merit Award at the annual Grammy party thrown by the Recording Academy's Producers & Engineers wing. There, Young announced Pono's upcoming SXSW introduction, calling the talk his ""commercial."" It sounded epic and, with all those fanciful words written out, effective.That being said, what makes some of Young's other extramusical contributions more meaningful than other common types of public-spirited charity work? Because Young's ego is epic too, but in the most personable, positive way.The idea behind Pono has been rambled about for years now, but that's beside the point. A digital-to-analog music player meant to work off a handheld device, this cloud-based service is said to do just that: taking on the likes of iTunes by translating digital music to analog-quality sound. Young is currently negotiating with Sony to get album rights for its catalog transferred over to his proposed service.Claiming ""Internet piracy is the new radio"" and that the bigger problem with Internet piracy is that most of the sound quality is terrible, Young has proposed Pono as his solution.""The goal is to try and rescue the art form that I've been practicing for the past 50 years,"" said Young, who is scheduled to give a lecture about Pono at SXSW's Interactive festival today.He gives a modern look at internet piracy while following the adage ""if you can't fight 'em, join 'em."" (""Pono"" is also the Hawaiian word for righteousness.)Arguments have been going back and forth as to whether Pono will actually work. Its full mechanics are still in the works, though it's expected to be released to the public this year. According to Britain's The Guardian, he will launch a Kickstarter campaign for the device dubbed ""PonoPlayer"" on March 15.Story continues on the next page.Another Young inventions to have been fairly well-publicized in recent years is his hybrid electric car, the LincVolt. Sleekly assembled using Young's own refurbished 1959 Lincoln Continental convertible, the LincVolt has been seen as both a stylish environmental statement and a way for Young to flaunt his money. He also has outdoor speakers at his home that he can turn on with a wave of his hand, to be able to hear music while he rows out to the middle of his large lake. That kind of money.Meanwhile, making music appear while in the middle of nature sounds some kind of amazing. It's a fair use of money.Last year Young appeared on The Daily Show to promote Pono, saying, ""I'm not trying to change the world...I'm just trying to make it so that when I look at it, it's great, you know what I mean? Not so I can make a million dollars, or even a gazillion...""It's easy to apply Young's philosophy to his other inventions as well. Pretty things are nice, and he gets that. So his classic-car design looks pretty slick, and may be more appealing than your average boxy hybrid cars.And then there's Young's most pono contribution yet, in my opinion: his Trainmaster Command Control. An avid fan and collector of model trains, Young actually holds many patents for various inventions involving their aesthetics.His goal with this project was to make sure his son, Ben, could actively enjoy the trains nearly as much as his dad does. Ben suffers from cerebral palsy, and so lacks the necessary motor skills to operate an average model train.Trainmaster Command Control was Young's novel solution. It's a programmable device that can alter controls to whatever the user prefers. As shown in the video above, Neil's son just turns his head, pushes a couple of buttons, and is granted the joy of model trains.And here's the obligatory line about how his inventions reveal Young's ""heart of gold."" I do know that song. But bad pun aside, his philanthropic ideas are the work of someone who has chosen to use his time and money in delightful and productive ways. Here's to his new Pono service being worth the effort.ROCKS OFF'S GREATEST HITSYou have successfully signed up for your selected newsletter(s) - please keep an eye on your mailbox, we're movin' in!The Ask Willie D Archives Top 10 Bars, Clubs & Ice Houses On the West Side Houston's Top 10 Bro Bars, Clubs & Ice Houses The Five Most Insane Bands to See Live Right Now©2018 Houston Press, LP.

The musician will use a keynote speech at the film and music conference on Tuesday (11Mar14) to unveil his PonoMusic.com service and PonoPlayer device, which is intended to offer a better-quality alternative to iPods and other MP3 players.A statement issued by Young reads: ""It's about the music, real music. We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does that. We couldn't be more excited - not for ourselves, but for those that are moved by what music means in their lives.""Young will set up a Kickstarter.com page on Saturday (15Mar14) to allow fans to reserve the 128GB playback device online, with early customers scoring a discount on the £249 item, which will be capable of storing high-resolution music to allow listeners to experience ""studio master-quality digital music at the highest audio fidelity possible, bringing the true emotion and detail of the music, the way the artist recorded it, to life"".The PonoPlayer was developed by Young with engineers at Ayre Acoustics. Young debuted a prototype of the device during a TV appearance in 2012, but plans to launch the player and downloading service in 2013 were subsequently delayed until this year (14).

999	Technology / 11 March 2014, 10:54am / SAPAWashington - Singer-songwriter Neil Young announced plans on Monday to launch a high-definition portable music player and download service, saying it will improve the experience of listening to digital music on the  go.The Canadian-born musician, a longtime critic of the quality of digital music, said he would be launching an online store for music  downloads as well as a portable player through his new company, PonoMusic.“It's about the music, real music,” Young said in a statement.“We want to move digital music into the 21st century and PonoMusic does that. We couldn't be more excited - not for ourselves, but for those that are moved by what music means in their lives.”The PonoPlayer will be sold online for $399 (about R4 000) on the crowdfunding website Kickstarter later this week, the statement said.The PonoMusic website was not operating on Monday. Young was scheduled to talk about the new service this week at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas.“Our goal was to offer the highest quality digital music available from all the major labels and build the world's best sounding, easy-to-use portable music player,” said John Hamm, chief  executive of PonoMusic.The technology in the PonoPlayer was developed with the engineering team at Ayre Acoustics, in Boulder Colorado.The statement did not include technical specifications.Several companies have begun offering players and downloads of high resolution digital music which restores much of the data lost when music files are compressed into MP3 format. Some experts contend, however, that average listener may not be able to distinguish between standard and high-definition music. - Sapa-AFPFinal nail in Zuma's coffinHow to get unblocked from all your WhatsApp 'enemies'Leaked phone call has Zulu royal family dialling lawyerSemi-naked selfie with teen has destroyed teacher, says his momFormer cop mauled to death by his own pit bullSign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.
