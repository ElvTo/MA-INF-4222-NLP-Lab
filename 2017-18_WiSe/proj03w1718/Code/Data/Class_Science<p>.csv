Titanfall will be propped up by dedicated servers. As much was made known last June, but what may not be so clear to players is that post-launch hiccups are primarily Microsoft's responsibility. Respawn engineer Jon Shiring recently explained to Engadget how Respawn used Microsoft's ""Azure"" cloud computing technology to handle elements of Titanfall like AI hosting and physics calculations.

""One of the really nice things about it is that it isn't my problem, right?"" Shiring said of potential server issues at the game's launch. ""We just say [to Microsoft], here are our estimates, aim for more than that, plan for problems and make sure there are more than enough servers available -- they'll know the whole time that they need to bring more servers online.""

Shiring said that during the game's lengthy beta program, the game's European servers filled up, and players were quietly transitioned to East Coast US data centers, indicating the developer's contingency plans in the event its launch is wildly popular tomorrow. Titanfall, a multiplayer-only game, is so reliant on the Azure servers that Respawn opted to not launch the game in some regions, such as South Africa. Shiring also noted in late January that server-side updates for the game won't cause downtime for players.

Our review of Titanfall will be supplemented with our first of many State of Service reviews, so expect to hear more about how the game's online play holds up after it launches.

That isn’t the case, but Respawn’s Lead Engineer Richard Baker says it might be on the horizon.“For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship,” he said in an interview with Eurogamer.Â  The interview goes into some great technical detail for those with a deeper understanding of the ins and outs of anti-aliasing, but it seems like a lot of it comes down to the fact that the Xbox One is still a fairly new console and that even the teams releasing some of the core titles are still mastering it.The framerate, which was not consistently locked at 60fps during the beta, is still not locked. Baker says, though, that we can expect improved performance. “The worst case scenarios are better,” he says.For the deeper technical details, check out the full interview at Eurogamer.

3	"Monday, Feb 12, 2018A few months after the launch of the latest generation of game consoles, Sony's Play Station 4 has outsold Microsoft's Xbox One 3-1. One of the main reason is the price- PlayStation 4's list price is $399 at launch, $100 less than the Xbox One. Also, the PS4 is available in 57 countries, while you can buy an Xbox in only 13. 
Exclusive games are the biggest differentiator between game consoles, so far neither console has a must-have game to persuade users to buy a new system. But that could change next week with the release of Titanfall, a game exclusive to the Xbox. 
Titanfall, set to release on March 11 for Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC, is poised to become one of the biggest games of the year, and it will almost certainly help drive sales of the Xbox One. The open beta for the game, which ran from Feb. 15 to Feb. 19, attracted around 2 million players, and Titanfall could end up being the first ""must-have"" game for either console. 
Recently Microsoft announced that the upcoming game Titanfall will be bundled with the Xbox One. If you pre-order at the Microsoft Store by 12PM PST on March 8th, you'll receive the console bundle on March 11. Priced at $499.99, it's actually the same price as the Standard Edition Xbox One console. It will also be available at Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart and Amazon.com.
Titanfall for Xbox 360 costs $59.99 on GameStop and Amazon, the release date is set on March 25.
Now available for pre-order, the bundle includes:

""The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it. For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship.""This resolution is similar to what was seen during a recent open beta test for the game on Xbox One, as is the 60 frames-per-second frame rate.Titanfall releases this Friday, March 14, for Xbox One and PC, and on March 28 for Xbox 360.This Week's MyRepublic Gaming Night is Titanfall on Xbox One This Week's MyRepublic Gaming Night is Titanfall on Xbox One Titanfall Drops Into EA Access This Week's MyRepublic Gaming Night is Titanfall on Xbox One You must be logged in to post comments.

One of the most-anticipated next-generation titles currently in development, Titanfall is set for release in less than 24 hours (from the time of this writing). Created by the minds that set a new benchmark for online multiplayer in the Call of Duty franchise, the blockbuster title from Respawn Entertainment is already being celebrated as a major step forward for competitive gameplay – combining fast-moving parkour with customizable mechs, as well as tried-and-true first person shooting.

                                    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('GameRant_300x250_300x600_ATF_2'); });
                                

While Titanfall does not feature a traditional story campaign, players will still be immersed in the game’s larger universe through brief bits of narrative that have been woven into online matches. Story-driven gamers could, likely, be underwhelmed, but the two online story branches are still a welcome glimpse at an intriguing world – one that Respawn hopes to expand through a recently announced live-action component.
Partnering with Playfight, the VFX company best known for their work on Call of Duty: Operation Kingfish and Rocket Jump’s Video Game High School, the developer is promising an expansion of the Titanfall story that takes chaotic mech vs. pilot battles and makes them a reality in live-action.

According to a statement attributed to Respawn Entertainment’s Dusty Welch:
Titanfall is set in a rich near future universe with visceral, epic battles with Pilots and their Titan companions. We wanted to partner with Playfight, who has a history of delivering movies that meld gameplay, live action and stellar CG into truly entertaining media, for Titanfall. What this collaboration brings is yet to unfold…”
Playfight appears equally enthusiastic about the partnership, considering their studio has “already begun laying the foundation for the creation of original content within the vast expanse of the Titanfall universe.”
What exactly the partnership means is, at this point, anyone’s guess – though we’ll get a much better idea when the project’s teaser trailer launches alongside the Titanfall game. Playfight has established a website for the collaboration at YourTitanIsReady.com – currently, the page includes a countdown clock that, when it hits zero (at 10pm EST), will unlock the promised teaser video.

There’s no question that the Titanfall universe could be a great foundation for a live-action movie adaptation or TV series; that said, considering that Respawn has partnered with Playfight, it’s much more likely that the venture will result in a smaller scale web series or simply live-action clips for inclusion in future DLC. Playfight is a quality VFX studio with several high profile properties under their belt but it’s unlikely they have the man power for a full-on Hollywood-style Titanfall production – even if the teaser site promises a “live action epic.”
Still, given that Respawn mastered the cinematic approach we’ve come to expect from the Call of Duty series, fans should expect the live-action Titanfall project to offer an immersive and high-quality experience (with great visuals).
–
That said, not everyone is sitting around waiting for the teaser, or counting the hours until midnight game releases, since some players already have Titanfall in their hands – and are hard at work ranking-up ahead of the official launch.

After Respawn and Microsoft promised not to ban or punish players who got ahold of the game early, lucky Titanfall fans have begun leveling their pilots and titans. A few players have even regenerated their characters (the equivalent of “prestige” in Call of Duty) – resetting leveling progress in exchange for G (insert number) designation on their player profile. Titanfall currently supports 10 generations – with a G10 designation being the ultimate honor.
These fortunate gamers might have a head start but many others are fully prepared for Titanfall tomorrow – unless you’re playing on Xbox 360 (and have another two weeks to wait).

After Respawn and Microsoft promised not to ban or punish players who got ahold of the game early, lucky Titanfall fans have begun leveling their pilots and titans. A few players have even regenerated their characters (the equivalent of “prestige” in Call of Duty) – resetting leveling progress in exchange for G (insert number) designation on their player profile. Titanfall currently supports 10 generations – with a G10 designation being the ultimate honor.
These fortunate gamers might have a head start but many others are fully prepared for Titanfall tomorrow – unless you’re playing on Xbox 360 (and have another two weeks to wait).

  ""description"": ""Respawn Entertainment has announced a partnership to create live-action 'Titanfall' content - with a teaser trailer releasing alongside the game launch.""
}

According to a statement attributed to Respawn Entertainment’s Dusty Welch:
Titanfall is set in a rich near future universe with visceral, epic battles with Pilots and their Titan companions. We wanted to partner with Playfight, who has a history of delivering movies that meld gameplay, live action and stellar CG into truly entertaining media, for Titanfall. What this collaboration brings is yet to unfold…”
Playfight appears equally enthusiastic about the partnership, considering their studio has “already begun laying the foundation for the creation of original content within the vast expanse of the Titanfall universe.”
What exactly the partnership means is, at this point, anyone’s guess – though we’ll get a much better idea when the project’s teaser trailer launches alongside the Titanfall game. Playfight has established a website for the collaboration at YourTitanIsReady.com – currently, the page includes a countdown clock that, when it hits zero (at 10pm EST), will unlock the promised teaser video.

There’s no question that the Titanfall universe could be a great foundation for a live-action movie adaptation or TV series; that said, considering that Respawn has partnered with Playfight, it’s much more likely that the venture will result in a smaller scale web series or simply live-action clips for inclusion in future DLC. Playfight is a quality VFX studio with several high profile properties under their belt but it’s unlikely they have the man power for a full-on Hollywood-style Titanfall production – even if the teaser site promises a “live action epic.”
Still, given that Respawn mastered the cinematic approach we’ve come to expect from the Call of Duty series, fans should expect the live-action Titanfall project to offer an immersive and high-quality experience (with great visuals).

After Respawn and Microsoft promised not to ban or punish players who got ahold of the game early, lucky Titanfall fans have begun leveling their pilots and titans. A few players have even regenerated their characters (the equivalent of “prestige” in Call of Duty) – resetting leveling progress in exchange for G (insert number) designation on their player profile. Titanfall currently supports 10 generations – with a G10 designation being the ultimate honor.
These fortunate gamers might have a head start but many others are fully prepared for Titanfall tomorrow – unless you’re playing on Xbox 360 (and have another two weeks to wait).

6	"Gamers in South Africa are calling on Respawn and EA to release Titanfall in their country, saying that if they want to play with a bad ping, they should have the option to do so.Update: Build Our Titans ZA has confirmed that even though Titanfall isn't being released in South Africa, South Africans can still play it by getting a non-region-locked key for the game and redeeming it through Origin. Both Kinguin.net and Evopoints.co.za are reportedly offering them.""Although this is a work around it is a VERY simple one,"" the group wrote on the Build Our Titans ZA Facebook page. ""We would suggest you take all that pent up frustration over the last couple of days and unleash it on some unsuspecting EU pilots!""It added that it will continue to push EA and Respawn to disclose the real reasons for the release cancellation, but for all practical purposes considers the problem solved. ""Our goal was to give ZA pilots the CHOICE to play Titanfall,"" it continued. ""It seems that choice is available (through no actions of our own) and every ZA pilot who wants to play the game now, can do so.""Original Story:South African gamers received a nasty surprise last week when Electronic Arts announced at the last minute that Titanfall would not be released in their country. The problem, according to a message on Origin, is simply one of performance: Titanfall relies on Microsoft Azure servers and there are none close enough to South Africa to provide a decent ping and thus a proper experience. Respawn founder Vince Zampella confirmed the cancellation on Twitter, writing that he doesn't want to ""sell you something that isn't great.""It would seem that quite a number of gamers in South Africa would appreciate the opportunity to buy something that isn't great, however. A petition launched shortly after the announcement by a group calling itself Build Our Titans ZA has already attracted nearly 1500 signatures, not an enormous number in and of itself but pretty impressive considering that it's coming from such a small slice of the gamer pie.The petition notes the lack of Azure servers in South Africa but says the game ran well and ""was still amazing even at the latency disadvantage,"" which left the nation's players dealing with pings of 180 ms or greater when connected to European servers. And while that number approaches the sort of lag you'd associate with a dialup connection, the petition says the final choice should be left up to the players.""We have been putting up with bad latencies to EU and US for many years in order to enjoy our favourite titles in a multiplayer environment. Please don't take away what might be one of the best FPS titles of the decade, on the pretense that we would not enjoy the experience with a higher latency,"" the petition states. ""We humbly petition Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment to make the game available to South Africans on release date, and give us the CHOICE to play Titanfall.""The petition's authors acknowledged that while the response to the game among South Africans was ""almost universally positive,"" its relatively poor performance might be enough to make Electronic Arts shy away, especially after the messes of SimCity and Battlefield 4. There's also reportedly speculation that potential legal complaints based on the country's consumer protection laws may have spurred the last-minute cancellation.""I think South Africa is too small a gaming market for EA and Respawn to bother with. Given EA's recent issues with releasing unpolished games (or games with a bad online experiences) they might have decided to avoid South Africa altogether given the fact that our latency to EU servers was 200+,"" a Build Our Titans ZA rep said. ""If you throw in any potential legal troubles that might stem from that experience then their decision might make sense. Compare this to Australia and India that have large thriving gaming communities... it wouldn't make sense to pull out from these territories as you're just throwing away revenue.""Australia, like South Africa, has no native Azure servers, forcing players there to rely on servers located in Singapore. Even so, the Titanfall launch in that country is proceeding on schedule.EA said in response to inquiries that it has nothing more to say on the matter than the statement it released last week. ""After conducting recent online tests for Titanfall, we found that the performance rates in South Africa were not as high as we need to guarantee a great experience, so we have decided not to release Titanfall there at this time,"" it said. ""We understand this is a disappointment for local fans and will keep them posted on any future plans regarding the release of Titanfall in South Africa.""Source: Change.orgServed from: 192.168.10.91 | Version: com"	Science
7	"SEATTLE, March 10 (UPI) --  Microsoft will be relying heavily on Titanfall,  set for release Tuesday, to boost Xbox One sales and keep pace with Sony's PS4 console.After both major console makers launched their products around the same the last year, Sony has taken the lead in sales followed by the Microsoft's Xbox. Microsoft is hoping that the new combat game will help revive its fortunes by providing buyers with a strong reason to buy their console.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
""Titanfall is an incredibly important game and it's coming at an important time,"" said Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group.The game, developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts, is a first-person shooter that depicts a battle between corporate mercenaries and local outlaws in far-off space colonies. The game has already received critical acclaim and will be released exclusively for Microsoft platforms -- the Xbox One, the older Xbox 360 console and Windows PCs. Microsoft will be using its servers to power functions like artificial intelligence of the gameplay, to allow for the console's processors to concentrate on creating more detailed animations.As of March, Sony said it had sold more than six million consoles, whereas Microsoft said it had sold more than three million Xbox One units to customers by the end of 2013, and hasn't released any recent figures. It is clear that Microsoft would like Titanfall to give its sales numbers a much needed uptick.“It’s very early in the race, but the danger is if PS4 just keeps building momentum, that could cause them a lot of trouble,” David Cole, a game analyst at DFC Intelligence, said of Microsoft. “The next nine months are really critical for Xbox One. Titanfall is huge in that respect.”Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, said that it was too early to make any sales forecasts but said the game has potential to become a major franchise if the response is favorable.Microsoft has said it will bundle the game with the console for $500, the cost of the console alone. This is an effective price drop of $60 for the Xbox One since that is Titanfall's retail price.

8	"The next generation gaming war isn’t over just yet. The Microsoft Xbox One is hoping to shoot down the super successful Sony Playstation 4 with the release of a brand new system bundle. The new critically acclaimed online shooter 'Titanfall' is coming free with select Xbox One consoles. Microsoft also recently dropped the price of the system for UK gamers.Thinking about going out and buying an Xbox One after work today? You might want to sleep it on it for one more night, or at least wait until midnight, when the new Titanfall bundle drops.Xbox’s chief marketing and strategy officer Yusuf Mehdi released a statement to the press about tomorrow’s bundle release:""In many ways, the launch of Titanfall will enable us to deliver the first truly next generation multiplayer game--one that will take advantage of the new party and chat improvements we're delivering, build on the power of the cloud in a way only Microsoft can, and connect fans on Xbox Live. If you've been waiting for the biggest game of the generation before purchasing your Xbox One, this special, limited time offer is perfect for you.""The Titanfall bundle is available for pre-sell at most major game retailer. Check your local stores to see if there is going to be a midnight release in your area.The system recently got a little cheaper for U.K. games. Microsoft’s U.K. marketing director Harvey Eagle issued a statement about the price drop:“At Xbox, we believe there’s never been a better time to join the new console generation. To help our fans do just that, Xbox One will be available at the new UK estimated retail price (ERP) of £399.99 from February 28th.”Is the free game download enough to get you to buy the system?

9	The Xbox One version of Titanall will have a 792p/60fps resolution when it launches this week,  lead engineer Richard Baker revealed in an interview with Digital Foundry.Bake also stated that the game’s resolution was “likely” to increase after the game’s release.“We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,” he said. “We’re going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimise… we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change.”Whether it’s an increase to 900p or 1080p, the debate regarding game resolutions on the Xbox One will continue for months/years to come.———–—————Want to get the latest gaming news wherever you may be?

13	Above: Titanfall in action.Titanfall may look good now, but it may get better.The final retail release of publisher Electronic Art’s sci-fi mech-battling shooter runs a resolution of 792p on Xbox One (which refers to the number of horizontal lines the game renders for each frame), according to tech experts at Digital Foundry. That’s the same as the beta test that EA and developer Respawn ran last month. It’s also a bit more than a hundred lines of resolution short of the 900p that developer Respawn said it was targeting. Now, with Titanfall going live tomorrow for Xbox One and PC (and Xbox 360 later this month), Respawn is still looking to improve its visuals.Titanfall isn’t ugly on Xbox One. Our review is pretty happy with its visuals, but things can always look better. Respawn engineer Richard Baker told Digital Foundry that his team is still experimenting, and that a higher resolution could come in a future update.“The target is either 1080p [without anti-aliasing] or 900p with FXAA,” Baker said. FXAA stands for fast approximate anti-aliasing, which is much better at smoothing edges than standard anti-aliasing. These improvements might make for a slight overall visual improvement even if the difference is imperceptible to most people.“We don’t want to give up anything [to achieve a] higher resolution,” said Baker. “So far, we’re not 100 percent happy with any of the options, and we’re still working on it.”Don’t expect the update any time soon. When you pick up Titanfall on day one, it’s going to run at 792p on Xbox One.“We’re still looking at [an update] for post day one,” he said. “We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship.”Baker also said that Respawn is still working to optimize Titanfall so that it runs at 60 frames per second at all times. It is currently at 60 most of the time with occasional dips that cause the game to stutter.“Ideally, it would have been a rock-solid 60 [fps] all the time when we shipped, but obviously when there’s big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects — we’re still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time.”	Science
14	"Monday, February 12, 2018 | Updated at  2:16 PM ETStandby for Titanfall.In what is arguably the biggest game release for a next generation console to date, the Xbox One will launch its heavily anticipated exclusive multi-player shooter, Titanfall, this Tuesday.Produced by Respawn Entertainment, the game is already generating massive buzz in the industry, with some early reviewers claiming it will revolutionize the genre of first-person shooters. Microsoft has heavily promoted the game since its reveal last June, hoping it will be prove the blockbuster title necessary to help push sales of its new console.Although sales of the Xbox One haven't been disappointing per se, Microsoft is far trailing behind Sony's PlayStation 4 in the console race. According to The New York Times, Sony claims to have sold more than 6 million consoles worldwide. The last sales figure reported by Microsoft was 3.9. In January alone, the PS4 outsold the Xbox nearly two to one.Analysts cite the Xbox One's heavy price tag, ($500 as opposed to the PlayStation's $400) as one of the reasons for Sony's success. There's just been little incentive for most gamers to pay the extra money for an Xbox One... until now that is.""It's hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox,"" Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's chief marketing and strategy officer for devices, said in an interview with the Times.Microsoft is hoping that Titanfall will mirror the success of their other exclusive sci-fi shooter series, Halo. More than 60 million copies of Halo games have been sold since its initial release.Titanfall, developed by some of the same people who created Call of Duty, brings plenty of fresh and new ideas to the table. Set in the ruins of a war torn planet, players will command futuristic soldiers who leap and run along walls parkour-style as they battle one another. The game's main hook is in the ability to switch play-styles by piloting giant mechs known as ""Titans.""Titanfall is also unique in that there is no single player experience. Every mode including the campaign is played alongside others online.Titanfall will be on sale at midnight at several electronic stores nationwide. Players can also download a digital copy of the game if they choose.  frank rubio National Hydrocarbons Commission Disney Channel's newest star is adding diversity to the channel and empowering girls her age through her lead role in ""Stuck in the Middle."" 4:44 hassan jameel Get ready for the final matchup of the big tournament.CategoriesCategoriesFollow Us"	Science

16	"Titanfall will see a decreased resolution at 720P when it launches, but the developers hope to change that in the future. According to Respawn, developers of Titanfall, the game will ship at a lower resolution than what they wanted. Fans were hoping for a 1080P game, but Respawn notes that too many corners needed to be cut to offer that. ""We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA [multisample anti-aliasing] and instead using FXAA [fast approximate anti-aliasing] to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target,"" Baker told Eurogamer.He did note that the team is hard at work tweaking the engine and game to make it work in a way they are happy with. Due to that the resolution could very well improve in the future, but won't hit the target for launch. ""We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimize... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 percent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it,"" he added. ""For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship.""Sony was in hot water when Killzone Shadow Fall was noted to drop ""full 1080p"" in order to achieve a steady 60FPS framerate. The problem here is that Titanfall also won't run at 60FPS. ""We're still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally,"" he said.Hopefully the team stays hard at work and can figure this out. The game is technically a launch title trying to fit into a time slot, so these issues are expected to happen.

The Xbox One version of Respawn Entertainment's first-person shooter, Titanfall, will showcase its mech-battling action in 792p resolution when it ships this week, lead engineer Richard Baker confirmed during an interview with technical analysis site Digital Foundry.

The retail version's resolution and 60 frames-per-second output (mostly) mirrors the visual presentation seen in Titanfall's pre-release beta from last month. Baker explained that Titanfall is ""likely to increase resolution after we ship,"" though day-one players will be locked at 792p.

""We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower,"" Baker said during Digital Foundry's interview. ""We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimize... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it.""

18	We've launched our new website, we would love to hear your thoughts & feedback.Tomorrow (March 11th) the gaming word is going to be hit with a bunch of Titans. Of course, we’re talking about the most eagerly anticipated next-gen title so far: Titanfall for Xbox One. Early reviews of the game have been overwhelmingly positive, which is very good for the Xbox One. There is a lot of pressure on Titanfall to do what Halo did for the original Xbox. That is, of course, sell many consoles.To celebrate this awesome new game in the Microsoft ecosystem we have a few Titanfall lock screen wallpapers for your Windows Phone device. The wallpapers are in 1080p resolution, so they should look great on any device you have. The first wallpaper is based on the leaked Titanfall Xbox One console, and it is made by yours truly. The second wallpaper is a shot from the game art. The last wallpaper is an awesome design by deviantART user Obsolution.

20	"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) has been behind the eight ball in the next gen console battle for quite some time. The origins of this can certainly be traced back to before the release of its own Xbox One and the Playstation 4; they’ve essentially been playing catch-up ever since, making a series of staggering marketing errors when the console was originally unveiled.Since then, the Playstation 4 has consistently outsold the Xbox One all over the world, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) has felt something of a backlash from gamers for some of their initial proposals. Already the price of the Xbox One has been cut in an attempt to cut the sales gap with Sony’s console, and although Microsoft is publicly putting the usual PR spin on the way that the Xbox One has been performing, the reality is that Sony is dominating this generation thus far.However, one area in which Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) can be commended is with regard to the titles that they’ve got to market. The Xbox One launch line-up was probably better than the PS4, and much is expected of the hotly anticipated Titanfall, which will release tomorrow in North America, and a couple of days later in most other territories, as an Xbox exclusive.It seems though that Titanfall is to be plagued by another criticism that Microsoft has had to fend off with regard to the Xbox One. The Playstation 4 clearly delivers the more powerful gaming package, and though Microsoft has dismissed the difference between the two and developers are capable of producing similar standard products for both consoles, there is still no denying that Sony’s machine has higher capabilities.This is reflected in the fact that it’s been reported today that Titanfall will be yet another Xbox One title that won’t ship in 1080p resolution. It has been confirmed by the developers of the title that Titanfall will launch in 792p, although Respawn Entertainment is apparently intending to patch the game up to a higher resolution once it has been released.There is a lot of debate regarding this issue, with various claims being thrown around about the practical effects of high and low framerate and resolutions. It is often asserted, for example, that there is little difference between playing a game in 720p and 1080p on a high-definition television, but from my experience I would have to emphatically disagree.What is certain is that console gamers, and the wider general public, would surely be expecting media to be rendered in 1080p by now. It’s roughly ten years since HD became a mainstream technology, with television manufacturers of the time encouraging us to rush out and buy ‘full HD’ sets. Yet a decade on, 1080p resolution is still not standard. You have to wonder why Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) bothered to include 4K capabilities with this console; there doesn’t seem to be the remotest chance that it will deliver such a resolution, it can’t even handle full HD at the moment.Regardless of the debate on what practical difference such screen resolutions make, the continual inability of the Xbox One to deliver 1080p gaming, something that was pretty much the norm with the PS3, does not reflect well on Microsoft’s new console. The company itself can dismiss such concerns, but the gaming community has voted with its feet, and is not likely to change its mind based on the evidence we’ve seen from this console generation thus far.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!

22	"With the launch of Titanfall tomorrow, everywhere has deals revolving around it this week it seems like. This time it is Toys R Us’ turn with a great deal of their own, especially if you are looking to pick up another game as well.With the purchase of Titanfall for Xbox One, you will get 50% any other video game that is $59.99 or less. Essentially, you can get 50% off any game that isn’t a collector’s edition of some sort. This would be perfect for those who are looking to also get Dark Souls II at launch this week, or maybe South Park: The Stick of Truth from last week. There are certainly plenty of games to choose from to pair with the deal if you wish to do so.On top of that, you will also receive a free poster and $15 off a 12 month Xbox Live subscription, similar to the sale held by Best Buy. Just like the other sales, this one will run through Saturday, March 15, so get by your local Toys R Us before then, or see if the website is offering the deal starting on Tuesday. Dean James

2014-03-10T16:00:17.68Z Don't skip to the score just yet, folks, because you won't find one. We're not finalising our review of Titanfall until we've had a chance to test it properly on live servers. The following represents my thoughts on the game after ten hours of play at an EA-run event last week. The version I played was final, and I've seen the entirety of the campaign as both factions as well as every mode, map, and weapon - but until we know for sure that EA's servers are capable of handling the stress of launch, the game doesn't get PC Gamer's endorsement. As ever, it's worth waiting to hear launch-day impressions before you commit your cash. Titanfall is the last place you'd expect to find  restraint  . This is a bombastic, big money multiplayer shooter where robots fall from space; where jetpack-equipped 'pilots' dash over, alongside and through sci-fi cityscapes; where AI-controlled minions are shot, trampled, kicked and blown up by the squadload. It's a game where you'll run up a wall, jet into the air, lock onto a platoon of grunts with your smart pistol and eliminate them all as you land. It's a game where you'll drop a forty-foot robot titan onto another forty-foot robot titan just to see if you can.
It's a game where you will do all of these things - and more - constantly, thanks to lean, intelligent multiplayer design. Titanfall is silly on the surface and clever underneath, and this cleverness is characterised, somewhat counter-intuitively, by restraint.Matches are limited to twelve players split into two teams. This restricted player count caused internet uproar when it was announced, but is the foundation for all of Titanfall's other successes. A lower headcount allows the game to incorporate immediate respawns without upsetting the competitive balance of the game, and an intelligent dynamic spawn system means that when you die you pop back, near-instantly, a short distance from the next big fight. This small detail ensures that you are doing something exciting for the entire duration of each ten to fifteen-minute match.Titanfall's other features provide plenty of strategic options - and I'll get to them shortly - but keeping the scope of the game manageable means that you always have the opportunity to use them. This is what the latter Battlefield games got wrong. It's great to offer the player interesting objectives, vehicles, or weapons, but it means little if the player spends their time queueing, respawning, or running to get to the next firefight.Whenever I found my mind drifting during an extended Titanfall session, it didn't take long to realise that I was the hindering factor, not the game. I always had the option to go and do something more exciting, to play better, or to try to generate another of the 'you had to be there' stories that the game does so well.Here's a story, then. It's the closing minutes of a capture the flag match, and my team has a single point advantage - but the enemy has our flag. You can't score a point unless your own flag is on the stand, so in lieu of chasing down the enemy capper I opt to try to steal their flag and hold onto it until the match ends.We're playing on Boneyard, a winding series of desert canyons where small military bunkers are linked by ziplines. I sprint out of our base and, jetting into the air, use a bunker wall to pick up some momentum. I fling myself off, grab a zipline, and gain more speed: then I'm across a rooftop, through a short passageway, and up off the top of a defensive tower to ensure that I come down on the enemy base from above. Three enemy titans prowl the open area outside. Two are 'auto-titans', meaning that they are being controlled by the AI while their pilots are elsewhere. The third is manned. I activate my cloaking device to slip by them on the way in.As I dash toward the enemy flag I throw a grenade ahead of me, clearing the stand of mines and satchel charges - a habit I picked up in Tribes. The moment I touch the flag, I'm highlighted on the HUD of every player on the map: I become a target, immediately, for those three titans waiting outside.I glance at my own titanfall timer. Thirty seconds to go.There are NPC soldiers in the enemy base, and each one felled cuts a few seconds off my titanfall timer. I stop, crouch, and kill a few more with my carbine before rushing towards the precipitous drop to the desert floor. Leaping from the enemy base, I jump onto the roof of the manned enemy titan and unload half a clip into its innards. It's not enough to disable it, but it's enough to make the pilot disembark to try to dislodge me. By that point I'm away, jetting onto the next titan, buying myself the seconds I need to...My titanfall timer hits zero. I aim at a point on the ground in the midst of the enemy titans and hit the 'V' key. A green marker appears, and another timer, this time counting down from two.My Ogre titan smacks into the ground on all fours, hunched like a silverback. I leap towards it and it holds out its arm to help me climb inside its chest. As its interface comes online, I'm already hammering the key to deploy electric smoke. Then, in the midst of the chaos, I'm away, thundering across the desert towards our base, carrying the enemy flag towards the line of friendly titans that stride out to meet me. And it feels - here's the important part - incredible.This series of moments is useful because it highlights how Titanfall's best qualities come from lots of individually well-designed parts operating together. As a footsoldier you always have access to a broad range of movement abilities that turn you into a cross between TF2's Scout and Tribes: Ascend's Pathfinder. You can double jump, zipline and wallrun at will, and with a bit of time you start to learn how these can be used in tandem. Wallrunning, for example, speeds you up - it's by chaining together wallruns without stopping that you build up titan-beating momentum. In the same way that a good Tribes player learns to see each hill as component parts of a longer route, so do Titanfall's cities eventually start to look like inviting, freeform obstacle courses.How you choose to use your special abilities alongside your mobility is up to you. You might be a sniper who uses freerunning and a cloaking device to escape when your vantage point is discovered, or a close-quarters brawler who uses stims for a speed and health boost between firefights. You might spec for covert ops but swap out the cloaking device for a special vision mode that lets you see enemies as glowing skeletons through walls.In each case you'll also be making decisions about whether to hunt other players exclusively or stop to kill the platoons of NPC minions that spawn throughout each match. Doing the latter might reveal your position on the minimap, but it'll also shave seconds off your titanfall timer. At first, the presence of AI cannon fodder seems like a way of counterbalancing the reduced player count, but they actually function like creeps in Dota or League of Legends. 'Farming' is a legitimate strategy, and some teams may choose to equip one player with a minion-slaughtering smart pistol so that they can be the first to bring a titan into play.How they choose to kit out and use that titan is entirely up to them. Placed on auto, a sturdy Ogre could hold a capture point against opportunistic cappers in Domination mode. Alternatively, an auto-titan using the mid-range Atlas chassis and equipped with shields could be lead through the streets to open the enemy to a flanking assault by on-foot pilots. You might prefer to take charge yourself, nipping at the enemy in a nimble Stryder chassis equipped with hit-and-run quad rockets and electric smoke.The point is that you will constantly have interesting decisions to make, loadouts to tinker with, and daring plays to make. The game showers you with unlocks, but the most interesting changes to your playstyle come with experience. You learn to combine game features in new and exciting ways, and are forced to adapt on the fly to new maps and rulesets.You can also change the game for yourself with 'burn cards', disposable unlocks that allow you to access certain bonuses for one life only. They scale in power with rarity - the most basic allow you temporary access to weapons you haven't unlocked yet, and the most advanced grant you instant titans, reveal all enemies on your minimap, or grant you a permanent cloak when you stop shooting. Burn cards could have been a hook for some truly awful monetisation, but thankfully that's not the case. They are dished out with such frequency that my deck was constantly full - after a few hours of play, I never entered a match with anything less than a full set.The game ships with fourteen maps. The majority offer a mixture of open and urban environments - the former being the preserve of titans, the latter offering cover to on-foot pilots. One map, set in a prison, links open courtyards with sweeping internal roadways at multiple levels of elevation, giving titans rare access to the game's vertical dimension. Another, a smuggling outpost, mixes complicated nests of buildings with a wide-open bay area where titans can spar with each other in waist-deep water.Almost all of the maps succeed at feeling like real places. Interiors are littered with detritus - bookshelves, upended tables, pots and pans, scattered papers - that make them look as if they have been abandoned in a hurry. Each map has a distinct palette, and there's a level of design skill evident in their buildings and backdrops that creates a feeling of occupying a piece of well-constructed, if familiar, sci-fi concept art.Two maps stand out as exceptions to this rule - one is a symmetrical and relatively featureless training ground, and the other is a partially-buried desert bunker that would look more at home in a Halo game.Texture quality and character detail both fall below modern standards when viewed up close, but they are compensated by unfaltering 60 frames per second performance at 1080p and phenomenal animation. Titanfall looks much better in motion than it does in screenshots, and again this is down to the small details. Titans in particular are more expressive and human than the mechs you might be used to. They brace against damage, lean into sprints, and dismember each other in a variety of colourful ways. Even an action as simple as reloading a chaingun is rendered with care and attention to detail.The vast majority of your time with the game is spent in traditional multiplayer, which is divided into five modes. Minions, hackable turrets, and titans are common to all five, but one of them - Last Titan Standing - is remarkable for working more like World of Tanks than regular Titanfall. Each player spawns inside their custom mech, and whichever team is able to destroy all of the enemy's titans is the winner. Dying knocks you out for the entire round, but if you're able to eject from your doomed titan then you can keep fighting on foot. This turns Titanfall into a class-based vehicle game of sorts, where interactions between titan abilities become more important than they are in other modes.Those others include Attrition, where kills against minions, titans and players are added up into an overall score for each team, and Hardpoint Domination, where teams fight over capture point scattered over the map. Capture The Flag is included without many changes to the formula, but feels considerably revitalised by Titanfall's new ideas. The weak link in the set is Pilot Hunter, a team deathmatch mode where only kills against players count towards each team's score. It's fine on paper, but in practice it's the only mode where you're really conscious of the fact that there are only six players on the enemy team. Whenever I found myself unsure about where to go, what to do or who to shoot, I was playing Pilot Hunter mode.Then there's the campaign. You are likely to play it first, in reality, but I'm discussing it last because its qualities are grounded in exactly the same things that make regular Titanfall multiplayer enjoyable. It is, functionally, a narrative strung out across nine multiplayer missions that alternate between Hardpoint Domination and Attrition mode. Beyond narrative context provided by introductory intro and outro sequences, these missions play much like any other match.This is not a substitute for a singleplayer campaign, but it is a novel alternative. The scale of some of these introductory sequences is impressive - one team might land in dropships while other receives a briefing underground, or warp in from a space battle in orbit, or crashland and have to storm into the map proper via a beachhead offensive. The game gets its Call of Duty-style scripted sequences, but crams them into an economical slice of time before the game itself begins. This is a smart refocusing of the genre onto its key strengths. That said, there are players who will miss having something to play while they're offline, and who will be frustrated by the way Titanfall casts you as an anonymous soldier in a story that is played out in voice-over by characters you're never personally involved with.It's also a huge shame that the campaign doesn't branch in any meaningful way. Certain lines of dialogue change depending on whether teams win or lose each match, but the overall arc of the plot doesn't alter at all. Winning a battle only to find out that your side lost for the sake of the plot is a massive waste of potential. Fully-realised, Titanfall's new ideas about shooter storytelling could have made it a classic and injected much-needed life into a tired genre. As it is, it's a novelty rather than a revolution.I'm very impressed by Titanfall, and I'm keen to start playing it again on launch. The multiplayer FPS hasn't felt this fresh or multilayered since the release of Team Fortress 2, and even that game was based on foundations laid ten years before its release. If Titanfall - or something like it - had been released fifteen years ago, I suspect we'd be talking about it today in the same hushed tones reserved for Tribes 2 and Team Fortress Classic. Titanfall is every bit good enough, from moment to moment, to be a part of that legacy.Where it does fail, it fails because of the ways that games in general have changed in the last fifteen years. The notion of the shooter as a MMOish 'service' manifests in ugly ways: the lack of LAN or offline support of any kind, the high price tag, the inevitable season pass. You can form a party with your friends and queue for games, but you can't create your own private lobbies or dedicated servers. You can't even queue to play a specific map on a specific gamemode - you can choose to play Capture The Flag, for example, but you've got no say on where you end up doing it. These issues are not necessarily dealbreakers, but they prevent the game from receiving the outright recommendation it otherwise might.The things you do in Titanfall are likely to be some of the most exciting things you do in any game this year. It is clearly the work of sharp, analytical designers, and it deserves to penetrate the thick layer of cynicism that traditionally surrounds big budget shooters of this type. It's just a shame that this same intelligence and restraint isn't evident in the business culture that surrounds the game. If you choose to invest in Titanfall, make it your mission to track down the stories that emerge when all of its systems come together and sing. They are why this genre became so popular in the first place, and Titanfall is a fine way to rediscover that attraction.

25	"Respawn Entertainment is days away from launching its hugely anticipated sci-fi shooter. We talk to programmer Jon Shiring about the technical revolution going on in the background
Keith Stuart

Mon 10 Mar 2014 19.44 GMT


First published on Mon 10 Mar 2014 15.47 GMT

In Titanfall, the war zones are alive with activity. Not just the usual chaos of players scurrying through buildings, blasting each other, but peripheral events, too. Gigantic star cruisers float overhead as smaller craft zip around them firing missiles at distant buildings; towering monsters lope across looming alien backdrops, attacking defensive walls; engineering robots make futile attempts to repair damaged facilities. Developer Respawn Entertainment wanted to instil in its multiplayer-only title a sense of narrative cohesion, a feeling that these distant planets exist beyond the frenzied firefights going on in the foreground.And about those fights. In a blogpost last summer, programmer Jon Shiring explained in clear terms the benefits of Microsoft’s ‘cloud’ platform – that ethereal marketing construct that has reared its mystical head in every Xbox One publicity drive since last May. Because of the cloud, he said, Titanfall matches won’t have to be hosted by players, which causes all sorts of problems, not least the capacity of the host to cheat or just leave the game, stranding everyone else in the process. Instead, every Titanfall bout will be on a dedicated server, ensuring all players get the same performance, and that the game experience is stable. It’s a boast that Respawn had to put to the test last month during its Titanfall beta test, which saw the servers opened up to two million players. ”We learned a lot of important lessons,” says Shiring, speaking to the Guardian days after the beta closed. “The whole point of the beta was to make sure that it scales up well. We completely maxed out every data centre in Europe at one point, and we still had more people who wanted to play so we started to invisibly shuffle them over to east coast US data centres so they could take part. We weren’t planning on doing that but we just thought, well, let’s push it until it breaks. That was our mentality.” The wisdom of cloudsIn his blogpost last year, Shiring admitted that the term ‘cloud computing’ has become almost meaningless, a fancy ad man’s idiom for ‘a lot of servers’. But with Titanfall is seems, there has been a clear benefit. The game runs on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, a vast infrastructure of severs with a global network of data centres. Microsoft’s business model is to rent space on the platform to web companies and even government agencies needing cloud computing resources, so this is in no way unique to Xbox One: any developer on any machine could run a cloud gaming service via Azure. The advantage for developers, though, is that, according to Shiring, Microsoft is offering access to the platform at a massively reduced rate to game makers. Studios that could never afford to harness Azure or rent their own dedicated worldwide server network, can now get on Microsoft’s. According to Shiring, the benefits aren’t just about being able to offer dedicated servers, it’s about virtualising the online experience and moving a lot of the processing tasks away from the gamer’s machine – known as the client – and toward the server. With a large network of servers available, Respawn is able to seamlessly shift players around when data centres get over-crowded, finding them spaces in other areas. And since the beta, the company has worked out how to track those ‘orphaned’ players – people who have been shifted to a more remote centre – and get them back to their nearest node when things quiten down. ”So, if you’re in Germany you’d rather be on the Amsterdam data server, but we may may move you over to Ireland if the Amsterdam one fills up,” explains Shiring. “And since the beta, we now have the knowledge that whenever you search again, you’d really rather be back in Amsterdam. We can invisibly shuffle you back so you get the lower ping.”Virtual worldsVirtualised cloud hosting of this sort has been used for a while in massively-mulitplayer online games, and Mojang employs a similar set-up with its multiplayer hosting service, Minecraft Realms. But using cloud-based or virtualised environments is a really new thing in first-person shooters where latency is much more of an issue. Titanfall is essentially taking the entire multiplayer experience and running it on the server-side - it should mean better in-game performance, smoother matchmaking, and improved social functionality. We’ll need to wait for the launch to see how all this holds up.For Yusuf Mehdi, the chief marketing and strategy officer for Xbox, this is exciting stuff. It is the evidence Microsoft needs that its approach to the cloud is going to deliver results. “We’re thrilled about what Titanfall is doing to showcase the future of gaming on Xbox One,” he told us. “It takes advantage of the cloud architecture that we’ve built behind Xbox One, which is really new - our Thunderhead servers give you the ability to do a lot of cloud compute, which means very high performance, very fluid games - and in this case a multiplayer world that can operate at incredible performance levels.”Another key benefit of this set up is that Titanfall is able to do all its AI calculations on the server rather than on your console. This has allowed the designers to fill the landscapes with computer-controlled soldiers who get involved in the action, carrying out their own tasks and helping players. It also means that when you call in a Titan, it can function on its own accord until you get into it, either finding its way to you and following you around or guarding one location – depending on the commands you give it. Intelligent balanceGetting the computer-controlled troopers to the right level of intelligence has been a major balancing issue accroding to Shiring. “Earlier versions were much tougher,” he says. “They were really formidable, and we’ve dialled it back to the point we think it’s fun. Spectres are harder to fight than the regular guys, but they’re set for fun not for technical prowess - we’re not here to impress everyone with how smart we are at writing AI. “The grunts and spectres are there to help out. They’ll capture points for you, they’ll hold and defend points - the spectres will leap a couple of storeys up onto the top of buildings if you’re annoying them. There are a lot of different AI behaviours that are all very tuned. It’s really easy to make AI that just laser beams everyone with headshots - the trick is to make them behave so that they don’t look like an aim bot. They have their own thought processes – they scan the world, they look for targets, if you listen to their voice chat you’ll hear that they lose sight and call to each other, they’ll call out when you’re approaching them. When you’re in a titan and you come up on one, if they’re a grunt, they’ll get scared and fall to the ground and you can stomp on them, or they’ll run away - there are a lot of different behaviours happening”According to Shiring, access to a low-cost cloud computing network is going to change the way studios design games. ”The two biggest aspects will be that server CPU and the server bandwidth - that’s what allowed us to make Titanfall,“ he says. “When you’re trying to rely on individual PCs or consoles as your server CPU, basically you’re stealing that resource from the player when you could be using the machine’s processing power to make the game look and play better for them - all that fun stuff. By having that reserve CPU out on the server - and it’s significant, it’s like a two-core machine– it’s a different philosophy: it becomes, well, lets use what’s there as efficiently as possible and there’s no benefit to not using it - there’s no downside to clients at all, the game just gets better. “And the bandwidth is what lets us have so many moving things in the world - we have the AI running around and the spaceships in the sky, all of this is creating network traffic , but as we’re not bandwidth constrained, it’s not this overwhelming technical task anymore. You can say to the designers, go to town dude, try what you like, and it’s just going to work. We’ve really let the designers go crazy on the game. When you get into that mindset… people have ideas of what it’s definitely not okay to talk about while designing multiplayer games and a lot of that goes away. We’re pushing the edge right now, but I have a feeling that other people will arrive at the same conclusions we have.”Mehdi is clearly onboard with this idea of computing tasks handled in the cloud ether. ”It’s what we’re most excited about,” he says. “That was the reason behind investing so heavily in getting these Thunderhead cloud servers and building our architecture. A lot of games can now offload compute-intensive tasks to the cloud architecture - we can scale that up and down as needs demand. It allows much master game design, it allows smaller studios to build incredible games because they can use our bandwidth as opposed to having to buy and run their own servers, which is costly and time consuming. I think this is really going to open up the whole open-world concept - the idea of multiplayer gaming in a large environment that’s actually living and changing.”Cloud controversyThere are still issues though, and still concerns. Titanfall’s grunts and titans work in a very specific way in a constrained landscape, so it will be interesting to see how other game types utilise server-side AI. Speaking to Eurogamer last year, EA Dice chief Patrick Bach was skeptical about using the cloud in some real-time gaming calculations, calling the concept “gimmick”. “In practise we’re doing things in real-time,” he told the site, “so you don’t want to send an explosion up to a cloud, calculate it then send the data back down and then it goes poof. We still need to have stuff done in real-time, but I can see other things you could potentially do with it.” I take this back to Shiring, an ex-member of the Infinity Ward coding team, and ask, really, what are the key differences between working on Titanfall and working on Call of Duty? ”Honestly the biggest thing is the ability to rely on dedicated servers because it frees up so much programming time,” he says. “All the client-side stuff goes away and that’s really gnarly because players can come and go at any time - the sever is the only node in the hub that’s guaranteed to stay there so if you move everything onto the server all the logic becomes really simple, which means we get to spend our time making the game really fun, instead of spending the whole project getting the thing working. It’s not magic, but I got to cut corners - we freed up a lot of programmer time to work on the game rather than the infrastructure.”But what about the future, what about more sophisticated implementations than a multiplayer first-person shooter taking in confined arenas? We talk about the prospect of massively multiplayer, procedurally generated online worlds; the sorts of things Microsoft hyped during the early days of the Xbox One promotional drive. What about games where the world is online and inhabitable and modifiable by thousands at the same time? ”That’s interesting,” he says. “I mean, we’ve seen it in Minecraft obviously, but I’d like to see it in games like ours. And having the servers out there makes this a lot more reasonable to attempt. You can have the server hold an emergent persistent world, save your state and reload it and keep going from there.But cloud computing remains controversial. It’s a concept that, however filled with potential, still concerns those who worry about the ownership of games. With Titanfall, a multiplayer-only title, it sort of makes sense that lots of the computing is done on remote servers, but what happens when single-player adventures start offloading tasks to the cloud? What happens when Microsoft or the publisher shuts those servers? Of course, the concept of ’owning’ movies, music and games has become more complex since the dawn of digital distribution, but as more of the control cedes to the corporations and service providers, darker questions are raised.For now though, many developers like Shiring are excited by the potential of this new technological generation – and it is hard not to be similarly enthused while talking to them. “Everyone is free to make whatever they want now - there aren’t really any massive constraints left,” he says at one point. “We have lots of ram, lots of CPU cores, so it’s a different mentality to a lot of older engines - all the work is much more evenly spread. It’s up to studios to come up with good ideas.“That’s more exciting to me than any new rendering or shader tech. We can more or less make whatever game we want to make at this point”• Titanfall is released on PC, Xbox 360 and Xbox One on 11 March in the US, and 14 March in Europe. As this is a multiplayer-only title, the Guardian will not run a review until the game has been tested on public servers."	Science

					Titanfall comes out tomorrow, and other than fan claims, we’ve not heard the official word on the game’s resolution on Xbox One. That has now changed thanks to an interview with Respawn’s lead engineer Richard Baker.Speaking to Eurogamer, Baker confirmed that 792p is the same resolution as the beta and that they’re experimenting with several options to try an increase it, without compromising the frame-rate.“We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we’re going to use, so we’re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don’t have to have this larger render target.“The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimise… we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship,” he said. FXAA and MSAA are both techniques of removing aliasing from the surfaces and edges in games, each come with its pros and cons.For more Titanfall coverage, you can head here for Sam’s impressions of the game, and here for a look at new maps and modes, and finally here for our review round-up.Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Titanfall -- a video game for several Microsoft platforms -- is about to be released, and the company apparently sees it as a hugely important title for its Xbox One console.Titanfall is a multiplayer shooter that pits two teams of up to six players against each other in open combat. Players control ""pilots,"" who can either engage with each other directly or take command of titans, giant robots that can be called in from the sky. Pilots are more agile, but titans are more powerful.

Players can opt for a number of game modes, including Attrition, which is a team deathmatch-style mode focused on garnering as many kills as possible; Last Titan Standing, wherein all players start in titans and have a single life; and the classic Capture the Flag mode.

Titanfall will be available Tuesday for Xbox One and PC. It will debut on Xbox 360 on March 25.Microsoft is planning a series of major launch events for the game Monday evening at retail outlets across North America. The company is giving away more than US$2,000 worth of prizes at each store's launch event, starting at 9 p.m. Prizes to be handed out include Xbox One bundles prepackaged with the game, controllers, media controllers, and subscriptions to Xbox Live -- the Xbox multiplayer service that is required to play Titanfall.Fans also will have the chance to try out the game at demo stations before it goes on sale at midnight. Xbox will host a live stream  with walkthroughs of new maps and developer Respawn Entertainment answering fan questions and discussing the future of Titanfall.
 

Titanfall, which has received early acclaim from critics, is viewed as an important game for Microsoft. The company's Xbox One system has languished in comparison to Sony's PlayStation 4, with sales of the latter 
outpacing the Microsoft console by two-to-one in January, according to NPD data.Sony sold more than 6 million units by March 2, while Microsoft shipped 3.9 million Xbox One consoles to retailers by the end of last year, according to company figures.""I think it will give those that have not purchased an Xbox One or had delayed in purchasing it another reason to go out and actually upgrade and buy one,"" Susan Schreiner, an analyst at 
C4 Trends, told TechNewsWorld. ""Right now, the PlayStation has a substantial lead. I would say Titanfall has the possibility of narrowing the gap.""Titanfall comes with a high pedigree as it 
was developed by much of the same team behind Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, a game that revolutionized online multiplayer gaming in 2007.

Microsoft is bundling Titanfall with the console in a package deal that retails at $500 -- essentially giving the game away for free, as the console itself retails at that price point. The title also may drive subscriptions to Xbox Live. The premium version of the multiplayer service is required to play Titanfall, which is pegged as an ""always-online"" game. 
 

 
The online-only aspect of Titanfall already has caused some problems, with publisher Electronic Arts 
canceling this week's planned launch in South Africa after testing showed online play performance was not quite at an acceptable level.Respawn Entertainment 
will look further into the issues after the game's release, cofounder Vince Zampella said. Many major online multiplayer games have had issues with meeting demand at launch, including last year's Grand Theft Auto V and Battlefield 4, and it's unclear whether Titanfall's launch will take off without such hitches.""As with absolutely any online-driven gaming experience, there's a minimal expectation of some issues -- we can never tell just how significant until the service is live in the wild,"" Steve Bailey, senior games analyst at IHS Technology, told TechNewsWorld.""This is a sizeable learning curve for EA, in terms of both console gaming and leveraging new hardware (Xbox One),"" he said. ""However, if we see a repeat of the issues that dogged Battlefield 4, it would compound the hit that EA's reputation will suffer as a result. The company has made major investment into this incredibly complex and demanding sphere, but needs a less bumpy ride than that which played out in 2013.""Whether Titanfall can help Xbox One surpass PS4 in sales also remains to be seen.
 

 
""The horizon is still rather blurry for a lot of games on both formats, compared to the resolution we now have on Titanfall, which has tremendous pedigree and has been a tangible, playable presence at many trade shows and conferences for quite some time,"" Bailey noted.""Sony has Infamous: Second Son inbound, to which I wouldn't attribute as much interest as Titanfall -- although that's no slur on its quality -- but it also has a lot of first-party hands that it's yet to show, and I suspect this year's E3 or even GDC (Game Developers Conference) will see PlayStation rectify this,"" he said.""Further, PS4 has a more industrious indie/download slate, PlayStation Plus is gaining momentum, and the price differential remains,"" Bailey pointed out.""Overall,"" he concluded, ""we still stand by our existing analysis on PS4 versus Xbox One: It's the former that will achieve an overall lead, but the battle won't be so clear-cut in the Xbox heartland of USA.""

29	As it seems is the major issue with the Xbox One, Titanfall fails to display at 1080p just like the demo failed to do. When put to the test, the game only reached 792p which is only slightly better than last gen’s 720p. Lead engineer Richard Baker for Respawn Entertainment confirmed the resolution to Eurogamer and said the studio is tinkering with ways to improve the game’s visual performance post-launch. So what do you think of the news, are you going to play the game on PC or the Xbox One?

30	"The Microsoft-exclusive game Titanfall will be released on Tuesday.The game has been dubbed Call of Duty with robots as both games have been developed by the same company. Titanfall can only be purchased for Windows, Xbox One and Xbox 360, the major competitors of Sony. The Xbox 360 version will be released March 25.A $500 game bundle will include the game and the Xbox One, which is essentially a price drop for the console that normally goes for $500 on its own. The bundle is also $100 more than the PlayStation 4.Titanfall will see if the console can handle the expected surge of digital downloads, as Forbes notes.""Sure, at launch people may have been downloading Dead Rising, Forza, Ryse, etc, but now with Titanfall, this is one day and one game, and a huge number of players that may be thinking they want to save themselves a trip to battle the lines at Gamestop, and simply download the game through their Xboxes directly,"" said Forbes tech contributor Paul Tassi.Titanfall was in development for two years, and early reviews have been positive, according to the New York Times. It's meant to be played online with other players, unlike most console games that feature a lengthy single-player campaign.""Titanfall will help propel the idea of high-definition gaming,"" said Patrick Soderlund, the executive vice president of EA Studios at Electronic Arts.There are high hopes for Titanfall because of Vince Zampella, who worked on Call of Duty. ""It was a little bit of trying to do something familiar yet different,"" he said.But he's not worried about missing out on possible sales. ""Microsoft is going to push us because they see us as a game for selling their system,"" Zampella said.Microsoft will be throwing midnight release parties that start at 9 p.m. EST.

31	Titanfall is more than just a potential sales boost for the Xbox One, it’s also the first real test of the digital infrastructure that runs Microsoft’s new console. If everything goes accordingly, Titanfall will be available for digital download on Xbox Live tonight at midnight in the United States alongside launch events for physical retail copies at participating stores.As Forbes contributor Paul Tassi notes, this is the first major game release since the console’s launch, so Xbox One owners are anxiously awaiting the moment the download goes live to see if Microsoft is prepared for the massive influx of downloads.Even if the Xbox One can make it through tonight unscathed, there’s the matter of Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform holding up, which will be hosting the servers for Titanfall. After the extravagant failure that was the Battlefield 4 launch, gamers are understandably less than optimistic that the online-only Titanfall will be running smoothly once everyone begins jumping into matches. Here’s hoping EA, Respawn and Microsoft can prove us wrong.And just to wash away any beliefs you might have that Titanfall isn’t going to be the event of the week, here’s a look at Microsoft’s online data centers before and after the game launched in Asia from Respawn’s Jon Shiring:Titanfall is now officially launched – first location: Asia (Korea, HK, TW, etc.).

32	Electronic Arts’ hotly anticipated game “Titanfall” hasn’t even been released yet, but one insider claims it has already helped Microsoft sell approximately 1 million additional Xbox One consoles. In the early days of this generation’s “console war,” Sony’s popular PlayStation 4 has taken an early lead. At last count, Sony had sold 6 million PS4 consoles globally as of early March. Meanwhile, the last official number we got from Microsoft was 3 million Xbox One consoles sold worldwide through the end of 2013. Some believe Microsoft’s silence speaks volumes, but a new report suggests Xbox One unit sales have ballooned dramatically thanks to the highly anticipated upcoming release of Titanfall.PlayStation news blog DualShockers directs us to a recent post on the NeoGAF forums from Pete “FamousMortimer” Dodd, an industry insider that the site says has a solid track record.In the post, Dodd claims that despite the fact that Titanfall hasn’t even launched yet, mounting anticipation for the mech-style first-person shooter has already led to an addition 1 million Xbox One consoles having been sold in recent weeks.“Marketing guys project that Titanfall has already helped sell around 1 million Xbox Ones. This is based off of things like upticks in sales after every major Titanfall announcements,” Dodd wrote in his post on NeoGAF. “They don’t know if it will move 200k more at this point. The titanfall bundle is selling less than Microsoft projected (but they are still hopeful for a big swing come tuesday).”Titanfall will be released on Tuesday, March 11th, and you can read BGR’s Titanfall beta preview of the game here.Copyright 2018 BGR Media, LLCPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use	Science
33	"I’ve been killing since I was in kindergarten. I’ve eaten ghosts, stomped living mushrooms and shot down every conceivable type of vehicle. I’ve beaten countless men to death with my bare hands and feet. And this was all just in the 1980s, when Reagan and Charles Bronson were supposedly making the streets safe again, and when I had to be in bed by 9.This all happened in games. I have a thirty year record of guilt-free destruction within CRT screens, tiny monochrome squares and TVs in both standard and high definition. Beyond videogames, even, violence is a foundation of the games that people have made and played for as long as people have existed. How old were you when you learned the card game War?
Titanfall is a shooter. It’s made by some of the designers of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, the textbook shooter of the last decade. There are guns and I shoot them at human-looking characters controlled (sometimes) by real-life humans and occasionally (rarely) I am good enough at shooting these human-looking characters that they die before they are able to kick me in the face to death. It is light and fast-paced and so frantic that I never stop to think about the implications of the virtual violence I perform. The thought that an entertainment so frivolous and absurd could be any more corruptive of an influence than paintball or laser tag is laughable. And yet I still feel unease when I play most modern-day shooters. It’s not the possible influence a Call of Duty or Battlefield could have upon its audience—it’s how these games tend to unite feel-bad shock tactics like terror attacks and war-torn residential areas with an inescapable exaltation of the machines that make such destruction possible. Modern Warfare can include as many “war is hell” clichés as will fit on a loading screen, but every Call of Duty since the first Modern Warfare has tried to awe us with supersoldier technojive while uncomfortably co-opting our response to real-life disaster. Many of the people who worked on the first two Modern Warfare games worked on Titanfall. In many ways Titanfall feels like a Modern Warfare, from the basic controls to the bombed out buildings and rubble that dot most of the multiplayer maps. Titanfall eschews the sordid manipulation of every Call of Duty since the first Modern Warfare, though, by embracing its near-future sci-fi backdrop. There’s no plausible realism here—this is pure popcorn, with minimal stabs at real-world relevance or commentary. Like most games, it’s made to be enjoyed, and it doesn’t gum that up with half-formed, hypocritical attempts at a message. Purely as a game Titanfall succeeds more than I could have expected.




Titanfall avoids those post-Modern Warfare clichés by mostly eliminating the campaign in traditional terms. There is a campaign here, with a story and everything, but it’s a series of multiplayer maps tied together through voice-overs and seconds-long briefings before each mission. The experience points earned during these missions go into the same collective pool as those earned in plot-free online matches, building a sturdy bridge between the campaign and the chaos of traditional online play. That summer blockbuster mentality of constantly outshocking every last Call of Duty campaign is what lead to the worst aspects of those games, and Titanfall’s sci-fi setting and the multiplayer focus of its campaign removes that crutch. This is not the convoluted and increasingly ludicrous shooting gallery campaign of a Call of Duty—this is a successful realization of what Brink absolutely failed to achieve three years ago.The best thing about Titanfall is how little it cares for the laws of physics. Like every pilot in the game I wear some kind of rocket boot contraption that lets me jump obnoxiously high and far, and once I’m in the air I can jump again to get even higher/farther. (They call it a “double-jump”?) I can also wall-run like Mirror’s Edge, gliding along the sides of despoiled military buildings as if it’s my job. I can double-jump into a wall-run, leap across a gap and dance across another wall, and then double-jump again through a window into the opposing team’s command center, where I immediately get shot-gunned by two or three people at once. (Usually.) This commitment to fast, graceful, patently unrealistic movement is another factor that shreds whatever kind of verisimilitude might be expected from a modern-day shooter. That motion creates vertical possibilities that are thoroughly explored by the level design. Levels sprawl out around but also above and below, with towers and collapsing skyscrapers to climb, and networks of tunnels and trenches often providing low-key routes between important locales. If I can see something on the map odds are I can get to it through a combination of jumping and wall-running. I often zone out of battle (one of many things that make me a horrible teammate) and grow fixated on the landscape. On one map there’s a giant cannon pointing towards the sky that towers over everything else. I was able to get almost all the way to the top during one round, spending probably half the match jumping and running up its side to see how high I could go. My goal was to stand on the very edge of its barrels and leap to whatever death awaited me. I couldn’t get to the very top, but the fact that it seemed possible and that I was able to scale most of that height in a smooth and elegant fashion has stuck with me more than any battlefield heroics so far. In another match I was on top of a building when an enemy transport ship flew by to drop off more soldiers. Its wing was within reach of a double-jump. I tapped the button once and flew up, tapped it again at the peak, and fell just a few virtual inches short of the wing as it shot back into space. I probably couldn’t have actually landed on the plane—I probably would have fallen through it as if it didn’t occupy any physical space within this digital world—but the fact that I was even able to reach that point, to entertain the thought of boarding this vehicle that exists solely to add detail to the world and not to serve any actual interactive purpose, was more exciting for me in that moment than my most acrobatic or improbable kill.I rarely tire of running and jumping, but when I do I can call my Titan mech and cavort about in a giant robot suit for a spell. The shifts in tactile feel and combat tactics when climbing into a Titan are significant. Everything slows down as my Titan lumbers about the map, crunching enemy grunts and drones underfoot while looking for opposing Titans with which to play first-person Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots. 



Even though Titans can come outfitted with telekinetic shields, rocket launchers and massive chain guns, they aren’t that hard to take down. Titan-on-Titan duels can end quickly, and every pilot is armed with one heavy anti-Titan weapon that deals significant harm to exposed Titans. Pilots can also ride on Titans, both friendly and unfriendly, and in the latter case can do a surprising amount of damage in a short period of time. Titans aren’t quite the game’s focus (outside of the Last Titan Standing mode, where every player starts in a Titan that can only be destroyed once, I could easily go entire rounds without calling my Titan) but they play a crucial role in most encounters. Strategy and teamwork are vital for maximizing the value of Titans—although their lives are as infinite as the player’s in most modes, there’s a two-minute cool-down period that can momentarily deprive players of their most powerful weapon.It’s surprising that there aren’t more multiplayer modes custom-tailored for the Titans. There are five multiplayer modes at the moment, and only Last Titan Standing prioritizes the mechs. Attrition is a fairly standard squad-based deathmatch, although victory is decided by “attrition points” that vary depending on how an enemy is killed and what kind of enemy it is—the AI-controlled grunts and specters that provide less talented players with the opportunity to feel useful only earn a single attrition point when killed, whereas ending human-controlled pilots or Titans reap many more. Capture the Flag is exactly what it sounds like. Hardpoint Domination is the mode I’m most capable at, as the points flow fast simply by standing around one of the three hardpoints that need to be captured and maintained. I am good at defense because it means avoiding offense. Pilot Hunter is a one-for-one point-to-kill deathmatch mode—for every human controlled enemy that is killed, a team earns a point. The Variety Pack randomly cycles through these modes and every map in the game, whereas the campaign consists of a playlist of these multiplayer forays tied to specific maps. The variety of modes may not be as plentiful as it should be for a multiplayer-only shooter.The biggest caveat of all when it comes to a game like Titanfall involves servers. I’ve played during extremely low volume times, when finding any game can actually be a challenge because there just aren’t that many people playing this unreleased game yet. Beyond the ongoing drama with Battlefield 4, recent online issues with HBO Go during the True Detective finale and the WWE Network during its first major live programming reiterate how easily servers can be overloaded and insufficient. Titanfall might be a mess at launch, but it was eminently playable over the weekend during a time of absolute minimal stress. “Fun” is something of a bad word among many readers and critics. It’s a nebulous concept that’s entirely subjective and as a professional writer I should be able to find other, more descriptive words to suit my purpose. Well, I just dished out like 1600 of those other words, so I feel no reluctance at calling Titanfall fun. It’s an interactive sci-fi cartoon with soldiers (both men and women) that move like superheroes and occasionally turn into massive robot guns. It’s devoted to the concept of pure play and as capable of realizing that goal as a Nintendo game, even if its version of play necessitates the shooting deaths of your rivals. These are timeless childhood japes professionally calibrated for all ages and without much of the unseemly business found in most shooters today. It’s just the latest footnote in our timeless history of games about death and war, and one I’ll continue to enjoy and utterly fail at for the foreseeable future.

38	"Titanfall is just few hours away from its official release on Xbox One and PC. Only few moments ago Respawn Entertainment's lead engineer confirmed that Titanfall on Xbox One ships at 792p. It's a bit disappointing figure because recently concluded open beta of Titanfall ran at 792p only, so we expected something close to 900p for the final build.According to reports coming out from Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann, Titanfall on Xbox One struggles with frame-rate figure despite running at a low resolution of 792p.Jeff Gerstmann wrote in his pre-review of Titanfall: ""The frame rate in Titanfall is uneven on the Xbox One and though it's usually fine, it can get downright nasty in specific situations.""""In one Last Titan Standing matchwhere every player spawns in a robot suitseveral players crammed their mechs into a tight area and began duking it out, and the frame rate dived down to what must have been single digits per second. Even out in wider areas, the game feels a little hitchy from time to time, and there's noticeable tearing throughout.""This was the same issue experienced by players in Titanfall open beta, so it seems like Respawn Entertainment was unable to fix it before launch.If Respawn Entertainment was not able to hit the sweet 60 FPS mark with 792 resolution, why didn't they go for 720p resolution (at which Xbox 360 is able to run games like CoD without any issues related to frame-rate)Is there any pressure from Microsoft to up the resolution of Titanfall for Xbox One? This indeed looks like the case because few months ago, NeoGaf insider CBOAT leaked that Respawn wants Titanfall to run at 720p on Xbox One for smooth gameplay experience. Titanfall is powered by a decade old Source Engine so expecting a next-gen graphics/visuals would be a harsh thing.We are still putting this into our rumor category, but issues related to Titanfall's frame-rate mentioned above by Jeff Gerstmann is widespread and the conclusion derived from it can't be ignored.Tell us in the comment section below what you guys think?In another news, Respawn Entertainment confirmed that development team is working to increase the Titanfall resolution to 1080p or 900p but changes won't arrive anytime soon.

39	"Considering the real dearth of quality software on Xbox One, tomorrow can't some soon enough for the system's owners. After months of anticipation, Titanfall will soon be out on Microsoft's new console and PC, and most of the reviews are in.*It's the game that has been carrying by far the highest expectations for Xbox One, as it's seen as the first major release on the console that can supplement the relative lack of games available for the system. You may have played the beta, you might have only watched, and it's possible you avoided hearing much about it altogether. If you've been listening to the feedback, it might not be surprising that the reviews are very positive across the board.The uniformity in response to a big-budget release is almost unsettling-is it the expectations created by the hype, or is Titanfall genuinely just that good? Read the review excerpts below (and the full versions at the links) to make a determination for yourself.*Several outlets are holding their reviews until the game is played extensively with the public and they can better appraise the game.Polygon, 9/10: ""Titanfall is the rare game that feels like it came out on top of the few compromises Respawn has had to make. Sliding the spectacle and holy shit moments of an epic campaign among bold, fast multiplayer that steals unlikely elements, Respawn has made them shine like they belonged there all along. Titanfall may not mark the same kind of sea change that Modern Warfare started but the pieces are all there in a game that delivers on its potential as the next big thing......If there are complaints to be had, I'd point to performance. Titanfall sits at 60 frames per second most of the time, but when three or four Titans are on the screen at once, firing rockets and arc blasts, things take a dive. It's never not playable, but it is noticeable.I also wanted more ""stuff""--more options and more customization. For starters, Titanfall is begging for a spectator mode and more complex broadcasting options that have appeared in games like the Battlefield series. I also would have liked to see visual customization for Titans.""CVG, 9/10: ""Lastly, the game's always-online requirements are a little too restrictive: it's daft that you can't even play the tutorial if the servers are down.Though in truth, there's little reason to. It says much about Titanfall that its training courses are all but irrelevant: you'll pick up the controller and pretty much instinctively know how to play the game. Some will see that as a bad thing, and it's true that Vince Zampella, Jason West and co haven't strayed far from what they know. As debuts go, this is pretty safe territory, and not a Titan-sized stride forward.Yet by making some smart tweaks to established design standards, Respawn's terrific shooter is a jet-powered hop ahead of its rivals.""Games Radar 4/5: ""When you mix together all of these unique elements, you're left with gameplay that's relentlessly cool. You'll run along a wall like a boss, hitch a ride on the back of an allied titan, and then shoot at stupid minions as the metal monster runs around the map; or you'll call down a titan of your own and get it to follow you as you sneak through buildings, picking off enemy pilots that are jumping along rooftops......Titanfall blends familiar concepts with innovative ideas in remarkable ways, leading to a nearly nonstop supply of awesome moments. But for as fun as it is, you'll likely find yourself wishing Respawn was more ambitious when it comes to game modes, since there's a good chance you've captured enough flags for one lifetime.""Joystiq 4.5/5: When it's not all a clash of the you-know-whats, when there's a volatile mix of scampering boots and earth-rattling bipeds on the battlefield, Titanfall truly excels. It subsists on imbalance and the race to bear big arms first. It feeds on the fallout that results when equality means the other guy gets a robot too. Titanfall isn't tuned to perfection for everyone yet, but it starts as a smart, swift and startling movement in well-traveled space.""Gamespot 9/10: ""When you look at Titanfall, it's easy to see the familiar. Most of the weapons, grenades, and abilities fill well-worn niches. Many of the environments are like the grimy villages and industrial complexes that have hosted countless online battles in dozens of other games. The competitive modes are bog standard. And yet, when you play Titanfall, it's impossible to shake the feeling that you're playing something special.The overarching experience of playing Titanfall is one of rejuvenation and reinvigoration. The sprint speed, the arsenal, the game modes, and more are all firmly derived from some of the most successful online shooters of recent years. But by reinventing the way you move, Titanfall reinvents what it feels like to play a competitive shooter. The high-flying action intertwines beautifully with the brutish, tactical titan battles, creating battlefields that crackle with possibility. Titanfall is a leap forward for shooters, a game that combines the vibrant and new with the tried and true to create something special.""Copyright © 2017  GAMENGUIDE All rights reserved."	Science

Even though Titanfall is also launching on PC tomorrow (not to mention on the Xbox 360 later this month), the game is correctly seen as the most important technology and gameplay showcase so far in the Xbox One's short life. So the Microsoft-supporting pixel counters out there might be a bit worried to hear that the game will be launching at a resolution of 1408x792.That oddly specific number, the same as the resolution for last month's beta, packs exactly 10 percent more pixels in each dimension than the 720p images players are used to on most games for last-generation consoles. Respawn lead engineer Richard Baker confirmed Titanfall's launch resolution to Eurogamer, but he also said that the team was ""likely to increase resolution after we ship"" via a downloadable patch.""We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower,"" Baker told the site. ""One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target. We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimize... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 percent happy with any of the options. We're still working on it.""Baker's comments highlight the give-and-take regarding resolution and other graphical issues that developers often have to juggle now that the easier-to-achieve 720p resolution is no longer the de facto console standard. All things being equal, more pixels is generally better than fewer, but processing those additional pixels every frame on graphically intense games can necessitate either dropping the frame rate, lowering the detail and polish on in-game models, or reducing the number of things happening on screen at once.This balancing act between conflicting graphical priorities seems to be more of an issue on the Xbox One than the PS4 these days, with Microsoft's system falling a bit below 1080p for many games where the PS4 version manages ""full HD"" without issue. Of course, Titanfall isn't coming to the PlayStation 4, so console players are stuck with what they've got on Microsoft's system this time around.Playing with the launch-day version of the game on the Xbox One this weekend, I can't say the game's visuals suffered for what's apparently less than 1080p resolution. On the contrary, the game's visual style packs quite a bit of pop, with vibrant colors, smooth curves, and expansive vistas. The very occasional frame rate dips and screen tearing that came up during some especially intense scenes were more significant. I only noticed these issues a couple of times during a full weekend of play, but other people in my chat party were complaining about similar issues more frequently (Eurogamer's analysis of the beta also found some frame rate dips).In short, none of these graphical issues took away from what has been a very enjoyable experience with Titanfall so far. Still, the game seems destined to be a lightning rod for gamers who are keen on arguing about which console has the most graphical horsepower.When creating Ultima Online, Richard Garriott had grand dreams. He and Starr Long planned on implementing a virtual ecology into their massively multiplayer online role-playing game. It was an ambitious system, one that would have cows that graze and predators that eat herbivores. However, once the game went live a small problem had arisen...You must login or create an account to comment."	Science

Sherman Oaks-based videogame developer Respawn Entertainment, headed by Vince Zampella, is launching its new title, Titanfall at midnight, in what has been billed as a potential game changer for Microsoft's Xbox One  More Headlines © 2016 SOCALTECH LLC"	Science
47	Sign up for our daily newsletterheader-socialSecondary menuImage 1 of 8A brilliant update to the FPS formula, with both parkour pilots and towering robots providing thrills aplenty How do you transform an entire genre with one game, and kickstart sales for the fledgling Xbox One? A good start is to put Vince Zampella and Jason West in charge; they were two of the men responsible for the Call of Duty series, which blended twitch action shooting with RPG-style persistent progress. Titanfall, their debut effort at new studio Respawn Entertainment, again breathes new life into the FPS genre with an incredible mix of intense gunplay and precise movement; which somehow manages to be both familiar, yet unlike anything you've played before.Titanfall does this by blending two very different kinds of gameplay; the titular Titans are slow, powerful brutes with huge arsenals, but the Pilots that control them are nimble parkour experts that can dash across a level in moments, and without even touching the ground.Players start every round as a Pilot, fighting on foot, in the air and on any surface they can reach using a mix of wall-running and jet pack double-jumps. Once a two minute countdown timer has expired, however, they gain access to their Titan, which is deployed from orbit as and when it's needed.Titan's aren't a reward for good play, as every player will have the ability to call down a Titan several times per match, regardless of their position on the leaderboards. Pilots can board their Titan and take direct control, or stay on foot and let the Titan's AI do the driving – either to defend a particular point or follow them around the map, engaging hostile targets as they come into view.Titans each have unique abilities, like the rocket-catching Vortex Shield seen here Respawn has balanced the two types of gameplay brilliantly; Titans pack serious firepower and have the weight to crush infantry underfoot. Get caught in the open and a Titan will have no trouble picking you off from a distance with a brutal mix of chainguns, 40mm cannons and rocket launchers. However, pilots have several ways of taking them down.Each pilot carries an anti-Titan heavy weapon, such as a rocket launcher; while a more risky tactic is to jump on a Titan's back in a 'rodeo' manoeuvre, from where you can open a hatch and shoot into the vulnerable electrics. This usually forces the pilot, if there is one, to exit his armoured 'bot to take you out. It's the interplay between man and machine that makes Titanfall so compulsive, and which creates 'those moments' which you just have to tell other people about.Each mission epilogue provides a welcome change of pace, with no respawning and a mad dash to the escape podAnother refreshing addition to the traditional Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Domination modes is the Epilogue, where the losing team has to escape to a drop ship while the victors try to mop up any remaining opposition. Once you die here, there's no respawning, so you have to adjust your play style accordingly. Make it to the escape ship and you'll earn an XP bonus, but it's not an easy task when the entire enemy team is tracking you down.Each of the 14 maps have been designed with this balance in mind. They all have plenty of verticality, lots of walls to run along and enough room to manoeuvre that they feel like a playground for pilots to explore using a combination of parkour and jet pack double jumps. You move at a much greater pace when wall-running compared to sprinting on foot, so the best players will be constantly hugging vertical surfaces to make themselves a hard target.With so much verticality, you'll have to keep your eyes trained on the sky for enemy pilotsThe Titans can't jump and are often hemmed in by buildings, though there are clear areas ideal for Titan vs Titan combat too. There's no structural damage here, as while it would be nice to smash through walls or tear down buildings when piloting your mech, it would arguably unbalance the man and machine nature of the game.Titanfall is a multiplayer-only game, pitting teams of six against each other in a range of game modes. This sounds small compared to Battlefield 4's massive 64-player servers, but Respawn has managed to make every moment action-packed with AI-controlled grunts. They fill each map, airdropping in at random points to ensure you always have something to shoot.They don't pose much of a threat, and shooting them will put you on the mini-map of enemy pilots. Ignoring them is a bad idea too though, as weapon upgrades and accessories are tied to the number of grunts, Spectres (stronger, yet still computer-controlled, enemies) and enemy players you shoot. Encounters with several grunts, enemy pilots and Titans in follow or guard mode feel like hectic, large-scale battles, even if you're only actually taking on a single human opponent.With EA in charge of publishing duties, we were worried about the possibility of micro-transactions. Consumable cards, called Burn Cards, give you in-game rewards such as more powerful weapons, extra abilities or unique skills. They would be an ideal way of monetising the game, but as with the consumable cards in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare, the actual monetisation is thankfully absent.Burn Card abilities only last until you die – or to the end of the game if you don't bite the dust. This helps balance the more powerful cards, but frustratingly it does sometimes mean losing your supercharged grenade launcher or explosive-firing sniper rifle before you even have the chance to pull the trigger.Snipers will struggle to find safe vantage points, as you can get to any surface with a few jumpsAnd you'll do a lot of dying unless you're very good. Having both the nuances of Pilot and Titan combat to master makes this a harder proposition than Call of Duty. The maps are complex, due to their more vertical nature, and the game types mean you rarely have a chance to stop and think, it's all go, go, go if you want to come out on top, plus with only six players a side there's nowhere to hide your deficiencies. All that makes the learning curve pretty steep, though there is one place for new players to take a little refuge.Despite being presented as a 'campaign' the nine story missions play like any other online shooter - albeit with brief cut-scene interlude at the beginning and end of each match as NPCs fill the gaps in the rather basic plot. You can finish the campaign in 90 minutes, and experience the action from both the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) and Militia viewpoints in under three hours. This certainly isn't the game for anyone after an engrossing single player story.scripted moments at the start of each mission are as engaging as the campaign mode getsNor is it the title to show off the power of your next generation console Microsoft has secured an exclusivity deal which will surely help boost sales of the Xbox One, but the heavily modified version of Valve's Source engine is hardly a visual tour de force. The particle and smoke effects look pretty, and frame rates hold up for the most part, even during intense action, but textures are muddy in places and everything feels a little flat. A fact that isn't helped but the unremittingly drab colour scheme of Respawn's frontier planets.Whether there's enough content to keep casual players entertained for long remains to be seen; there are a limited number of weapons, Titans and abilities to unlock, and you could run out of new kit to try quite rapidly. For the hardcore, Respawn has yet to add clan support, private matchmaking or spectator modes. Through its £20 DLC season pass, Titanfall may gain new game modes, maps, weapons and Titans, but that remains to be seen. For the moment it's quite expensive given what you're getting, and those who aren't up-to-speed with online shooters may suffer badly.It is by no means perfect, but the flow of movement, rapid pace and sweetly balanced man and mech gameplay has comfortably usurped Call of Duty as our go-to twitch shooter of choice. Battlefield has more depth and Counter Strike is much more tactical, but Titanfall is something else, something very important, it's fun.View the discussion thread.The 22 best PS4 games to buy in 2018The best board games that you (probably) haven't playedWill Halo 6 be released in 2018?Best Xbox One games: The games you need to play in 2018A new Battlefield is coming in 2018, here's what we knowThe top 10 PC games you need to playXbox One X or PS4 Pro: Which should you buy?Save a bundle on a PS4 Pro with these deals The best PS4 deals this February 2018Analysts believe the PS5 could arrive as soon as late 2018SNES Mini (hands-on) review: A hard-to-find hit of nostalgiaRazer aims for high-end PC audio with the Nommo ProXbox One X review: Microsoft's 4K console is a beastShadow of the Colossus on PS4 is more than just a remakeNintendo Labo: Nintendo’s DIY cardboard accessory revealedXbox One review: Microsoft console is a serious contenderRise of the Tomb Raider reviewForza Horizon 3: The new benchmark for arcade racersFallout 4 reviewRed Dead Redemption 2 delayed AGAINThe best Xbox One S deals in the UK A new Battlefield is coming in 2018, here's what we knowXbox One X or PS4 Pro: Which should you buy?February Games with Gold is a strong monthBest Wi-Fi extenders: Better coverage, faster downloads© Dennis, a trading name of Dennis Publishing Ltd, registered in England & Wales no. 1138891.

""There's still room for optimisation and we're still working on it. Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 all the time when we shipped but obviously when there's big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects... we're still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.""

49	"A post-release Titanfall patch for Xbox One, upgrading the game’s graphics from the 792p of the beta that disappointed many early players. Although Titanfall for PC runs at 1080p, the Xbox One version of the game drops the resolution down considerably, something gamers had hoped would be addressed by the time the title reached store shelves. Unfortunately, according to the Titanfall developers, a fix won’t come until after the Tuesday release.
“We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,” Respawen lead engineer Richard Baker told Eurogamer. The issue, Baker claims, is one of eSRAM, which has already limited some multiplayer games in what resolution they can output. Respawn is still undecided on how it will address the shortcoming. “One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we’re going to use,” Baker explained, “so we’re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don’t have to have this larger render target.”That could end up with 1080p support on Xbox One, though non-anti-aliased, or alternatively 900p with FXAA (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing) support. “We don’t want to give up anything for higher res” Baker points out.While the core resolution hasn’t changed from Xbox One Titanfall beta to shipping release, the engineer insists that some graphical optimizations have been carried out and that the final game should look better than it did before. There’s no specific timescale for the post-launch resolution update.There’s more on Titanfall on PC versus Xbox One in our full hands-on.

51	 Written by   Thomas Chamberlain   on  March 10, 2014 at 10:47 am     Respawn have today revealed that the Xbox One version of Titanfall will likely see some improvement to the 720p resolution that the game currently has.Lead engineer Richard Baker  at Respawn spoke with Eurogamer and said:“The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimize…we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 percent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship.“A lot of the performance is on the GPU side. There’s still room for optimization and we’re still working on it. Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 [fps] all the time when we shipped but obviously when there’s big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects… we’re still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.”It is nice that they are going to try and improve the resolution after launch, however I am not sure it is entirely needed. In my opinion the game looked fine in the beta and people should be satisfied with the gameplay instead of focusing on the resolution. I do understand that the technical side is important to some people, but all it boils down to is internet arguments where people compare games based on how many pixels it has, which is not very important compared to how the game actually plays.Anyway, let me know in the comments below if you agree/disagree with me on this subject.

52	"If discussions on Twitter are any indication, “Titanfall” will outsell EA DICE’s “Battlefield 4” and give “Call of Duty: Ghosts” a serious run for its money, according to Forbes.Fizziology, an Indianapolis-based social media company that uses social sites like Twitter and Facebook to track thousands of search queries, compiled seven days’ worth of tweets, ending on March 4, a week before “Titanfall’s” launch. In this timeframe, the company recorded 161,439 mentions of the game on Twitter. Fizziology compared this to pre-release tweets about other games – 2013’s “Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag” was tweeted about 32,677 times. EA DICE’s “Battlefield 4” was mentioned only 80,969 times.    Will ""Titanfall"" outsell ""BF4?"" Photo: Courtesy/EA  Activision’s popular “Call of Duty: Ghosts” was tweeted about 182,736 times before its launch. That’s only about 20,000 more times than “Titanfall,” which is the first in its franchise. Of course, using Twitter as an early means to measure an upcoming game’s success is only telling part of the story.“Social media conversation data is increasingly becoming an important indicator of future purchase intent if the data is properly weighted and analyzed,” Rob Key, CEO of NYC-based social media and analytics consulting firm Converseon, told IBTimes. “This means looking beyond sentiment to understand the influence of those speaking and evaluating other relevant factors, such as intensity.”  Fizziology also noted that 69 percent of “Titanfall’s” tweets were positive, which means around 50,000 tweets spoke negatively of Respawn’s latest endeavor. Twelve percent of the conversation about “Titanfall” were gamers hoping to play on Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox One. Three percent of Twitter discussions were from people who had already pre-ordered “Titanfall.”Meanwhile, Respawn and EA are working hard to ensure “Titanfall’s” launch goes flawlessly. The game’s beta ended Feb. 19 – and more than 2 million players participated. EA and Respawn hoped the beta would eliminate any potential bugs and glitches ""Titanfall"" may contain. Respawn cofounder Vince Zampella admitted earlier this month he was actually a bit nervous about the first-person shooter's release.When a fan asked Zampella on Twitter Feb. 2 if he was excited about the game's March 11 launch, and the cofounder responded with “yes, but mixed with a bit of fear. We want the launch to be as smooth as possible. Beta should help.”“People are expecting the game to have problems, and I want to make sure that it doesn't,” said “Titanfall” engineer Jon Shiring in an interview with Polygon on Feb. 21. “I want to do everything I can to make sure that it launches well. The Xbox Live compute platform is all brand new.”An Xbox One update preparing for the game’s release began rolling out March 5.

However, unless you specifically want to buy it at Best Buy due to having store credit or something, Target has a better deal for you. If you purchase Titanfall this week along with the Titanfall branded 12+1 Month Xbox Live Gold Membership at the same time at Target, you will save $30. This essentially means you would be getting one of the two products for half price with the purchase of the other, which is a fantastic deal.

54	It’s still way too early in this console generation to tell how things are going to turn out, but by all accounts both Microsoft and Sony are enjoying solid early sales of their new video game consoles. Sony’s PlayStation 4 took a quick lead with sales totaling 6 million units through the beginning of March, but Microsoft sold 3 million Xbox One consoles in 2013 and a recent report also suggests that anticipation of Titanfall’s upcoming release added at least another 1 million units to the company’s running total. On what might be something of a negative note for Xbox fans, however, the same source who reported that Xbox One sales have skyrocketed thanks to Titanfall also claims that Microsoft has no plans to offer a Kinect-less Xbox One bundle anytime soon.According to industry watchers, one of the reasons Microsoft’s Xbox One hasn’t sold as briskly as Sony’s PlayStation 4 is the steeper price tag. The PS4 costs $399.99 while Microsoft’s Xbox One is sold with a bundled Kinect sensor for a total of $499.99.While the Kinect indeed adds tremendous value to the Xbox One gaming experience, many people have called for Microsoft to offer gamers a cheaper Xbox One option that ditches Microsoft’s voice and motion controller. Microsoft may indeed offer a cheaper Xbox One at some point — it makes sense, since the Xbox 360 was available at multiple price points — however those hoping Microsoft might offer a Kinect-less Xbox One option sometime soon are in for a bit of bad news.According to Pete “FamousMortimer” Dodd, the same insider who stated that Titanfall has increased Xbox One sales by 1 million units so far, Kinect is here to stay — at least for the time being.“As for ‘get rid of the kinect’ I agree with Pachter that it won’t be this year. Well, it can possibly be this year, but later this year,” Dodd wrote in a recent post on the NeoGAF forum. “I think his reasoning is the same as mine… because the people I talk to say ‘We literally cannot unbundle it, we have contracts with parts suppliers that are yearly or multi-year.’ Mattrick really f**ked them with that device. If you do see Microsoft announce a kinect-less bundle early, like at e3, keep in mind that means they are eating A TON of money. And that has to be worrying for a division that certain people would like to see sold off…”Dodd has a good track record when revealing unannounced plans, so it looks like the Kinect isn’t going anywhere right now. Of course, just about anyone who has used Microsoft’s Xbox One would probably agree that’s not such a bad thing.Copyright 2018 BGR Media, LLCPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use	Science
55	"This is a big week not only for Xbox One and gaming PC owners, but the gaming industry as a whole. A new IP will be birthed tomorrow under the name Titanfall. Its fresh take on the FPS genre has resonated well with many. However, its technical side might not.The Xbox One version of Titanfall hasn't been able to nail down the 60 FPS sweet spot like many were expecting. Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann has noticed some unfortunate framerate drops when playing the game, which he noted in his pre-review:The frame rate in Titanfall is uneven on the Xbox One and though it's usually fine, it can get downright nasty in specific situations. In one Last Titan Standing match–where every player spawns in a robot suit–several players crammed their mechs into a tight area and began duking it out, and the frame rate dived down to what must have been single digits per second. Even out in wider areas, the game feels a little hitchy from time to time, and there's noticeable tearing throughout.I experienced similar issues during the beta, hoping that the final version would flesh everything out. It appears Respawn wasn't able to address the issue in time for launch.What makes this particularly alarming is that the Xbox One version runs at a 792p resolution. It's not much more demanding than 720p, the resolution the Xbox 360 was able to run games like Call of Duty at during last gen without missing a beat.To make matters worse, Titanfall isn't a very visually striking game. Yes, it is presented well, but underneath its polish is a game that runs on the 10-year old Source Engine. It's not a graphical showcase by any means.Although this comes as a shock, let's not be too hasty to throw a noose around the Xbox One. This is a game developed by Respawn Entertainment, a studio that has no relationship with Microsoft outside of the console exclusive deal EA worked out. It might not be the game that shows what the Xbox One hardware is capable of, but it's not a first-party game either.Some speculate that Respawn was planning to run Titanfall on Xbox One at a 720p resolution, as was ""leaked"" by CBOAT on the NeoGAF forums. These speculations argue that Respawn was pressured to up the resolution by Microsoft in order to make the Xbox One version appear more alluring. Whether or not the rumors are true is unclear, but it doesn't sound unreasonable. This begs the million dollar question: how will the Xbox 360 version fare? "	Science

57	"Part of the reason we can’t have nice things, say intelligent conversations about a game’s visual particulars, is that we’re our own worst enemies. Use the words “Xbox One” and “720p” (or “not 1080p”) in a sentence, for instance, and you might as well be Pavlov ringing his bell. But let’s try anyway, because I know some of you care in the clinically interested sense.Titanfall, Microsoft’s brightest star for the Xbox One, launching tomorrow, runs at a slightly odd-sounding 792p, or 1408 by 792 pixels, same as the beta. That’s according to visual design descrambler Digital Foundry, which confirmed as much speaking to Titanfall developer Respawn’s lead engineer Richard Baker.But that’s only where things stand out of the gate: Baker says the studio is still fiddling with the game and trying to ratchet up the visuals for a post-release patch, admitting things could rise as high as 1080p when all’s said and done.“We’re going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA,” Baker told DF. “We’re trying to optimise… we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship.”DF does its best to reverse-engineer Baker’s comments and speculates about the bottlenecks, which in this case may be the Xbox One’s ESRAM — not the GPU itself. According to Baker, the challenge now is in trying to get a lot of Titanfall’s particle- and physics-related effects working more in parallel.That said, I played the beta on a 720p LCD and it looked gorgeous. I’ve been less impressed by the whole rock-em-sock-em, generic future skyscrapers and giant mechs aesthetic, because I’ve seen it done so many times (and better) elsewhere, and nothing about the beta leapt out at me novelty-wise. But I had zero complaints about the performance of the game, or its obvious achievements on the object complexity and distance rendering scale, both leaps and bounds beyond the Xbox 360’s purview. MORE: The History of Video Game Consoles – Full

I don’t understand some of the calls for there to be an Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version of Batman: Arkham Knight?  Surely if developers have to constantly concern themselves with getting their game to run on old hardware we’ll never have games that take advantage of the extra horsepower of the new consoles? We’ll be stuck with titles such as Assassin’s Creed IV that look a bit nicer and have a steadier frame rate but do nothing to push the new machines.I’d have been disappointed if the new Batman had been announced for the previous gen as this would limit what the developers could do. I would have thought Sony and Microsoft are also pushing for games to only come out on their new consoles as this is the only way to drive sales by having games that simply aren’t possible on the out going machines.I don’t remember with previous generations there being calls to have Tomb Raider running on the  Mega Drive, Super Mario 64 on the Super Nintendo, or Grand Theft Auto III on the first PlayStation?
PE Mystery prize
Bit of an odd one here. Our TV got left on Challenge TV and Wheel of Fortune was on. One of the spot prizes was referred to as a ‘custom built arcade game’. It looked like a steel briefcase, like you see in movies with money or precious stones in, or a bomb.It was only on screen for a moment and I’d never seen anything like it before. Do you or a reader have any idea what it could be? The show was from 1988 I saw in the credits.
half_empty80 (PSN ID)GC: 1988? We’re not sure what that could’ve been. Companies make replica arcade cabinets nowadays, but we don’t remember that happening in the ’80s. How mysterious. Launch subscription
Reading Deashes’ letter about console contracts it got me thinking whether it would be a good idea or not. Like he said Microsoft and Sony, even Nintendo, would benefit as more consoles would be sold on the contract. The downside would be early trade-ins. Take Xbox One for example; the first two major titles were Forza Motorsport 5 and Dead Rising 3.If Titanfall had suddenly been delayed from March to May some fans might have nothing to play until it was released, therefore the console might be sat unused for a couple of months. If they then decided to trade it in for a PlayStation 4 chances are they wouldn’t be able to cancel the previous contract.

When I said most players prefer playing online, maybe I should have rephrased it to ‘a lot of players would like to be given the chance to play or not to play online without it costing them money like the PlayStation 3’. I see how my comment might have been taken wrongly.I do play a lot of games in single-player, mostly my retro consoles, i.e. GameCube, PlayStation 2, etc. I’ve never really made any more contribution to the Underbox since Xmas 2012 when it all changed and we had to sign in with different IDSs which was to much hassle for me.

With regards to Football Manager on the PS Vita. I’ve just read that Football Manager 2014 Classic will be arriving on the PlayStation Vita in April, with more details to come next week. This was confirmed by Miles Jacobson on Twitter. I’ve been looking forward to this game for ages, as I loved the main game on the Mac, but due to fatherhood my gaming time is pretty limited, which means that the simplified Vita version will be perfect for me.It’s a bit disappointing that it’s coming out so close to the end of the season, and there are gamers already moaning that the player rosters will be outdated within a few weeks when the transfer market swings back into life. But if you want a portable football management game with a 3D match engine, then the Vita version looks like the one to get.

With the allure of Titanfall gnawing away at me, and my growing apathy towards modern military shooters, I’ve only gone and done it – I bought a Xbox One! After writing two features about why I felt Sony would win the next gen, you could say my actions are in-keeping with Microsoft’s many U-turns. Not that my perception has been altered of course, it’s still Sony’s to lose.Having now spent some time with Xbox One, I’m even more mystified how badly Microsoft marketed their product. It’s a very good console, surprisingly so given all the bad press. It’s well documented how the PlayStation 4 bests the Xbox in processing terms, but as an overall experience, I know which console currently feels more next gen. The all-in-one multimedia hub hasn’t quite lived up to the hype as yet, but then the more straightforward, gamer-centric PlayStation 4 isn’t the finished article either.Even my main bugbear Kinect hasn’t annoyed me too often, though it still won’t recognise the voice of my perfectly spoken six-year-old daughter. That’s a relief actually, the amount of commands she keeps throwing at the damn thing.Titanfall could very well turn out to be a system seller, but given how Microsoft have seemingly done everything in their power to alienate gamers, it’s a minor miracle they’ve accumulated the sales they have.I concede the only real surprise in this whole debacle is it’s taken me four months to buckle – the swines almost had me at Dead Rising 3. I do not condone my actions I might add; Microsoft are still the devil incarnate, as Sony were before them, and as for Nintendo, they still hate Europe right?

I’m really getting into GRID 2, I like the handling and the tracks have plenty of variety and I’m finding it much more enjoyable than Need For Speed: Most Wanted, which was the last racing game I played.The big surprise for me though is The Last Of Us. After all the Inbox love and critical reception it got I was expecting a lot from this game. After playing as far as the first encounters with Robert’s hired goons I have to say I really dislike this game. People have been complaining about the shooting mechanics in GTA V but I find the aiming and gunplay in The Last Of Us a misery.I know it’s a survival horror but I was expecting the gunplay to be at least as competent as the Uncharted series. I don’t know what’s coming out for PlayStation 3 over the next few months (I’m not buying Dark Souls II) but as soon as there is a release I like the look of I’ll be trading The Last Of Us in for it.My expectations for The Last Of Us were obviously too high, but I am wondering if any other readers feel this game just don’t live up too its hype?

What is wrong with you lot populating the Inbox? There’s constructive criticism and then there’s complaining over nothing. ‘Why is the Arkham Knight trailer pre-rendered?’ Because it’s an announcement and a very stylish one at that.‘Why aren’t there any in-game renders after such a long time in development?’ There are, do some research.‘I’ve always found pre-render trailers naff. I can’t believe people still get excited by some cobbled together sequence that fundamentally plays no part in the actual product’. I loved it and from the buzz around the Internet lots of others do too. It’s a talking point to generate interest for the latest entry in one of the most successful franchises in gaming, that’s why GC have had two stories and four Inboxes on Arkham Knight in only a few days. Nobody is foolish enough to think this is gameplay but this trailer is enough for me to (Bat)cave and buy a PlayStation 4 for this game.Come on people, it doesn’t take the world’s greatest detective to answer these questions, most have the same answer; Game Informer have the world exclusive on Arkham Knight and are constantly updating their website with new information, screens and eventually gameplay footage. The good people at GC will also relay this info as they get it.Let’s try and enjoy this, possibly the last Batman game Rocksteady make and hopefully a grand finale to their story.
Beastiebat (PSN ID)GC: The reason any trailer is pre-rendered is to have graphics that are better than the actual game. Plenty of people mistake it for real gameplay, which is why publishers aren’t allowed to show them on TV any more without a warning.

59	By Marlon Votta  - Mar 10, 2014Prior to this week’s upcoming release of Titanfall some early review scores are starting to emerge as respected gaming sites give their impression of this eagerly awaited  title. Expected to release on Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and the next-gen Xbox One we are intrigued to know what impression this has had on those lucky enough to get an early experience of this. A review by Video Gamer regards this as a very good first instalment, giving us reason to expect more in the future, as they feel a sequel is bound to be on the cards. Classing it as a tremendously enjoyable game and the 6v6 feature has been praised as a smart move. Throughout this review we get the impression this game is still yet to achieve its full potential and after testing this for 9 hours they felt it was worthy of an 8/10. Meanwhile, they say some of the maps do feel too similar to each other, branding the campaign multiplayer as sadly non-dynamic.Eurogamer document their views on Titanfall, but refrain from scoring it at the moment as they have decided to delay their full review until they have had the opportunity to play it extensively. With that in mind, their early preview does not hold back and their extensive account is still worth checking out. They mention how this game gets so much right and game-changing ideas that are easy to adapt to, in fact, so much so that they feel it is easy to get complacent. We also get the impression there is still room for improvement, and while they regard Titanfall as a step up for shooters, it is not a giant leap. When it comes to review scores Polygon’s 9 out of 10 gives us more reason to follow their perspective more avidly. Condensing their in-depth account it seems Polygon are impressed with Titanfall and suggest this title has all the makings of the next big thing. In addition, they reiterate earlier comments about it being a step up, but also remark on this not being a massive leap like that when Modern Warfare started. Overall, some great things have been said about the upcoming title, even though the word potential keeps coming up. In a recent post we discussed the Titanfall Xbox One system that gamers were hoping to get hold of, however, this console is only currently accessible to Respawn Entertainment staff, but we are hoping this will be available to the public in the future. With plenty of build-up surrounding Titanfall it seems this game is living up to its hype, and we cannot wait to get the gamers point of view.

Being a cynical grump whose calloused thumbs have fought countless digital wars, I feel the itch maybe two or three times a year now. I enjoy a lot of games, and I respect the technical artistry behind a lot of games. But not many of them are able to get under my skin.Titanfall has given me the itch. In fact, it’s taking a conscious act of will not to abandon my keyboard right now to go play just one more match. One more match that will invariably stretch to five or 10 or 25, until it’s 2:30 a.m. and the house is a mess and there’s no food in the fridge and my boss is demanding a doctor’s note if I miss any more work.Titanfall is a multiplayer first-person shooter that pits two factions of soldiers against one another on far-flung future battlefields. What makes it unique – because, let’s face it, modern warfare’s been done to death – are its namesake Titans, six-metre tall bipedal robots that player-controlled soldiers can climb inside and guide into battle.There’s also the game’s pedigree: It’s the first title by Respawn Entertainment, a studio stacked with many of the creators of the multibillion-dollar Call of Duty franchise. While Titanfall isn’t the first game to feature rock ’em sock ’em robots, Respawn has somehow found a way to mix jet-packing, wall-running soldiers with lumbering, powerful mechs, and make it work.Like, really, really work.Titanfall’s boilerplate sci-fi future imagines a string of frontier worlds where the militaristic Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation wants to strip natural resources from planets defended by the Militia, a coalition of mercenaries, pirates and ex-soldier colonists who will fight to be left in peace.This provides the connective tissue for six-to-a-side online multiplayer warfare taking place across 15 different and wonderfully varied environments, from a lush tropical fishing village to a gritty spaceship fuelling station to an outpost on a mountainous moon.At first blush the game feels a lot like Call of Duty, perhaps with a little less of that twitchy ferocity (but only a little) and without any sort of led-by-the-nose single player campaign. But as each match progresses, players are eventually able to summon Titans into battle, which drop from orbit in a roar of flame and thunder, immediately changing the dynamic of the fight. This sweaty, intertwined combat threesome – Pilots versus Pilots, Pilots versus Titans and Titans versus Titans – gives Titanfall a unique energy and fluidity that I’ve never seen in a shooter before.The game eases players in, introducing the fundamentals of combat and piloting Titans. But as players gain experience and complete one-off challenges, layer upon layer of options open up. This heady mix of weapon modifications, sidearms, anti-Titan heavy weaponry, special abilities and temporary perks granted by so-called Burn Cards creates neatly limitless tactical combinations. Even after dozens of hours of play, I keep discovering new ways to kill and be killed. It’s a game of constant revelation and invention.(In case you’re wondering – and you’re probably not – my own style favours a Pilot armed with an automatic rifle with an extended clip, a radar pulse ability that lets me briefly see through walls and electrical proximity grenades, while my Titan of choice is the chunky Ogre chassis with a massive cannon that fires three-round bursts, missiles that explode into clusters of smaller charges and a self-destruct sequence that sees my ride detonate in a nuclear blast when I eject. Which I do frequently.)Titanfall does have some shortcomings. Aside from Respawn’s deliberate decision not to offer any sort of single-player or offline component yet still charge a full $60 price, the most obvious flaw is the lack of depth or innovation in the game’s five modes. There are two deathmatch variants dubbed Attrition and Pilot Hunter, a remix of Call of Duty’s Domination mode called Hardpoint, Capture the Flag (exactly as it sounds, although the mix of Pilots and Titans offers some novel new strategies) and Last Titan Standing, which gives each player one Titan per round in a best-of-four set of matches.Fun? Yes, definitely. But there’s nothing here we haven’t seen in shooters before, which leads me to suspect Respawn is holding back some of the more interesting multiplayer variants for the upcoming, separately sold downloadable content packs.Although the game has no story-driven solo campaign, there’s a backstory to the IMC vs. Militia conflict that’s hinted at through snippets of dialogue and pre-mission briefings, along with a nine-chapter campaign mode that’s meant to fill in some blanks.While a multiplayer campaign is a novel idea – it’s designed to be played through once as the IMC and once as the Militia, in order to see both sides of the conflict – it just doesn’t work. There are short pre-mission cutscenes and the odd in-game scripted event that tries to explain what’s happening, but the minute you’re in the thick of the action, the last thing you want is some cardboard-cutout commander blurting exposition, or a picture-in-picture display showing a development happening elsewhere on the battlefield.Being an online-only game means Titanfall comes with some potential caveats, too. All three iterations of the game – the Xbox One and Windows PC versions out this week, and the Xbox 360 version landing later this month – will connect to Microsoft’s own servers, and the game will live or die on how well the back-end technology holds up. Given that Microsoft and publisher EA clearly hope this game will be to the Xbox One what Halo was to the original Xbox, there’s a lot riding on Titanfall launching smoothly.The 25 or so hours I logged with the game prior to its release were split between a two-day controlled review event and a weekend of playing at home, a time when there were at most a few hundred players online at once.Not everything was perfect: the low number of players online meant difficulty finding matches, the revamped Xbox One party system didn’t work properly and there were occasional mid-game server disconnections. On Tuesday, there will potentially be hundreds of thousands of players logging onto the servers simultaneously, and in the wake of disastrous online game launches like EA’s own SimCity, there’s no telling how smoothly things will run (although the success of Titanfall’s mid-February beta test bodes well.)Lastly – and while this is no fault of the game itself – I fear once the Call of Duty-type diehards sink their teeth into Titanfall and start analyzing it, they’ll begin exploiting strategies that a mid-level (at best) player like me can’t hope to keep up with. Titanfall’s longevity, and especially its ability to keep attracting new players to the fold, will hinge on how well it can match less-experienced players with those of the equal skill.And yet Titanfall has me firmly in its giant metal grip. I want to parkour along a billboard in Angel City, dropping down onto an enemy Titan to blast away at its exposed circuits. I want to sneak up behind an adversary holed up in a sniper’s next and snap his neck with a satisfying crack. I want the cheap but rewarding thrill of crushing a group of hapless A.I.-controlled enemy grunts beneath my Ogre’s feet. I want to flee for the evacuation dropship that comes to collect the losing team at the end of each match, and eject from my Titan directly into the ship’s open doorway just before it takes off.So many itches. And right now, a little voice tells me it’s time to stop typing and go scratch.I call it “the itch.”It happens when I’m cleaning the house, shopping for groceries, working at the office or busy with some other mundane bit of day-to-day living, and I suddenly feel a mental tap on my shoulder.“What you’re doing right now is boring,” says my pleasure-seeking Freudian id as it whispers in my mind’s ear. “Let’s get out of here and go play THAT GAME.”It doesn’t happen all that often anymore. Being a cynical grump whose calloused thumbs have fought countless digital wars, I feel the itch maybe two or three times a year now. I enjoy a lot of games, and I respect the technical artistry behind a lot of games. But not many of them are able to get under my skin.Titanfall has given me the itch. In fact, it’s taking a conscious act of will not to abandon my keyboard right now to go play just one more match.

62	"The sci-fi shooter is set to 'save' the Xbox One: here's what you need to knowTitanfall is the first AAA release of 2014 and it's already set hearts racing for both gamers eager for some giant-robot-on-giant-robot action and the business guys, who are hoping that the sci-fi shooter will boost sales for the Xbox One.Whichever side of the divide you’re on, check out our primer to get to know a little more about the game.Titanfall is releasing for PC and Xbox One on 11 March in North America; on 13 March in Europe and Australia, and 14 March in the UK and New Zealand. It’ll be coming to the Xbox 360 on 25 March in North America and 28 March elsewhere.If – as Microsoft execs hope – Titanfall is making you consider buying the Xbox One then there’s a bundle for that. For £400 ($499) you get the standard console, Kinect and controller, plus a digital copy of Titanfall. This makes a saving of around £80 if you’d bought the console and the game separately.Buying the standalone game costs roughly £45 for the Xbox One and £42 for the PC version. Obviously whether you prefer console or PC gaming is up to you, though developers Respawn have confirmed that players using a controller on a PC will get some aim assist.If you’re thinking about playing the PC you’ll need Windows Vista or later (64-bit only) and at least 4GB of RAM. Respawn say the slowest processor you can get away with is an AMD Athlon X2 2.8GHz or an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz ,while you’ll need a dedicated graphics card equal to or better than an AMD Radeon HD 4770 or an Nvidia GeForce 8800GT.

If you’re downloading the game for the PC then you can pre-load the title already – definitely worth it if you’re set on playing as you can bet that the servers will be under strain come launch day. The game itself is a 21GB download with a day one patch of around 1GB also rumoured before you’ll be able to play. File sizes are roughly the same on the Xbox One.Respawn has said that there will be three DLC content packs costing $10 a piece (roughly £7) or you can buy all three in the form of the Titanfall Season Pass for $25 (confirmed price of £20). If you’re buying the game for PC then the Titanfall Digital Deluxe Edition gets you the game and the Season Pass for £6.If you’re reading this article then the chances are you already know a bit about Titanfall, but to those of you who have been drawn in by the hype, here are the basics. Titanfall is a first person shooter where players control either nimble pilots that have little armour and jump about using a jetpack or titans, giant robots that can be summoned by pilots every couple of minutes for their destructive firepower.Players can customize their load-outs for both pilots and titans depending on their play style. There’s three types of titan: the Atlas for damage, the Ogre for defence and the Stryder for mobility.Pilots have a range of pistols and assault rifles alongside specialized heavy weapons for taking down titans and there are also various perks (‘Kits’) that offer boosts to anything from wall-running ability to health regeneration. AirbaseRedditAngel CityRedditBoneyardRedditColonyRedditCorporateRedditDemeterRedditFractureRedditLagoonRedditNexusRedditOutpostRedditOverlookRedditRelicRedditRiseRedditSmugglerRedditTraining GroundRedditAs well as the players there are also a variety of computer-controlled minions that seem designed mainly to make the matches feel fuller. Grunts are average foot soldiers, easy to kill, while Spectres are robots that can be hacked to fight for your team.There’s seven game play types including what essentially amounts to a team death match, free for all, domination (control certain points in the map) and capture the flag.So, basically there is a cat-and-mouse gameplay style between the pilots and the titans, with the addition of customized weapons and abilities in the style of multiplayer Call of Duty. This latter point is no coincidence as Titanfall is the creation of a number of staff responsible for the fantastically successful Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in 2007.In many ways Titanfall isn’t revolutionary. It doesn’t offer a new gaming ‘paradigm’ or make any ambitious attempts to ‘tell a story’. By all accounts there's nothing more exceptional about this video game than the fact that it's an incredible amount of fun to play.With Modern Warfare gamers found that when it comes to first person shooters, arena-based combat was much more consistently satisfying than playing through a campaign. However, successive titles in the Call of Duty franchise didn't to really vary of deepen this formula. With its pilot vs titan core and its increased sense of sense of mobility (think Call of Duty if your wall-running abilities were as expansive as those of Assassin’s Creed) Titanfall has a chance of re-booting the genre. Considering Call of Duty has made more than $9 billion in its 11-year history, this is not a small deal - either for the executives who worry about the future of the console, and for gamers, who simply miss having a good time.The Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

63	"The Sony PlayStation 4 is reportedly outselling the Xbox One. Microsoft is hoping Titanfall can change that. On Tuesday, Electronic Arts will release Titanfall, a multi-player title starring a bunch of heavily armored mechs. Titanfall is being released for Windows and the Xbox 360, but it is the Xbox One version of the game that is being watched the most closely. And for good reason: Although there have a been a handful of Xbox One exclusives such as Ryse: Son of Rome and Killer Instinct, there hasn't yet been the kind of ""must-have"" game that lures gamers away from the Sony PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Wii U. As Yusuf Mehdi, chief marketing and strategy officer for devices and studios at Microsoft, said in an interview with the New York Times, ""It’s hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox."" If the game succeeds, it could become a kind of next generation Gears of War – a Microsoft-only title that incentives the $500 investment in the pricey Xbox console. If it does not, the Xbox One could fall even further behind the Sony PlayStation 4 in the console market. EA has embargoed all reviews of Titanfall until late Monday, so it's too soon to say exactly what kind of a critical reception this game is likely to get.But early signs are promising. Last month, for instance, Stuart Andrews of TrustedReviews.com took a beta of the game for a spin, and came away impressed by both the depth of the combat systems and the immersive quality of the visuals. ""Graphically, Titanfall might not look a huge step on from cross-gen titles like Call of Duty: Ghosts, or the sterling work DICE pulled off in Battlefield 4,"" he wrote. ""Watch it in action, however, and it’s a different story. It’s impressively slick and dynamic, with every inch of the screen crammed with activity, and there’s a real attention to detail in the industrial design of the titans, and even the animation when you enter and exit your mech."" Microsoft is offering the standalone game for $60. But it will also debut a Titanfall bundle, which includes the console, a controller, and a copy of Titanfall for $499 – the same price as the base-level Xbox bundle. This is a move, the Wall Street Journal notes, ""that amounts to an early price cut for a device that arrived in November.""

64	"This morning the first wave of early reviews are in – and they’re overwhelmingly positive. While SlashGear’s long-form review will be posted soon [UPDATE: our long-form Titanfall Review is live!], we’re having a peek at what some of those looking at an early EA/Microsoft-hosted Xbox One-centric gameplay event have to say. Meanwhile, the game is already starting to release around the world – starting in Asia – that’s Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and more, already rolling out extremely quickly on servers for PC.
Titanfall is a first-person shooter game that expands on the model by allowing users to hop in and out of “Titans” – large mech warriors made to battle one another with beastly weapons galore. Players are also given characters with a much more agile set of abilities than the average FPS, allowing them to run up walls and make massive double-jumps with rocket packs. This game is set to take the FPS genre out a whole new door for both PC (Windows) and Xbox One. Over at Polygon you’ll find further confirmation that the first round of reviews are not in any way finalized products. As Arthur Gies suggests, this first round is just based on Beta gameplay and an event hosted by Microsoft and EA on Xbox Ones in a closed environment.“This review involved a two-day review event hosted by Microsoft and EA, playing on Xbox One consoles and “retail servers” on March 3 and 4, as well as time spent playing “retail” downloadable copies prior to launch by multiple Polygon editors. Staff also participated in Titanfall’s closed alpha and beta in January and February respectively. This review will be updated to reflect any extended server issues, should they arise.” – Arthur Gies, PolygonAs such, you’ll find that most reviews out today focus on gameplay, not final products in the field. This makes one whole heck of a lot of sense when you consider that the game is entirely online in a multiplayer setting.Over at GiantBomb, Jeff Gerstmann suggests that the team will be waiting until they see the retail version of the game to give it a full score. His first-hand comments suggest that this is not a game is good, but also not for everyone:“Titanfall is a very specific game built for a specific type of person. When you add it all up, the list of available content and the various options for speccing out your pilot feel light, and that might make this game a little hard to swallow at $60. But getting into these wild situations and shooting your way out of them feels fresh and fun in a way that the other shooters on the market don’t. If you like the basic form but need more of a twist on how you move and how you shoot, Titanfall’s core action is extremely satisfying, which makes it a little easier to overlook the lack of available modes.” – Jeff Gerstmann, GiantBombAt Eurogamer you’ll find word that this game works with a “drab line-up of game modes”, but also that the title is essentially a game-changer. This is a game that will bring you back in if you’re over the “hyper-macho military shooters” that command the environment today (or before today).” There’s still room for improvement, most notably in that rather drab line-up of game modes, and in its current form it’s perhaps more of a step forward for shooters than a giant leap. But that still represents the most positive momentum seen in the genre for at least five years.” – Dan Whitehead, EurogamerOver at IGN, it’s all about the positivity that comes with playing this game which introduces a whole new mode of play with Titans. Aside from noting that the game is “somewhat regrettably a barebones game in terms of modes and customization features at launch,” McCaffrey gives this title a really positive outlook.“After my first few rounds of Titanfall, hearing the “Your titan is now ready” notification began to induce a Pavlovian adrenaline-rush response. I still catch myself looking up to the sky as I press down on the D-pad to call it in, because watching my 20-foot-tall robot exosuit fall onto the battlefield, seemingly from Heaven, is a glorious sight that I still see replaying when I close my eyes at night.” – Ryan McCaffrey, IGNWith Gamespot it would appear that they’ve been convinced of the game’s full potential right off the bat. They’ve given Titanfall a 9/10, saying that the game is a “leap forward for shooters”, saying that, thus far, any “in-game hitches” were “exception to the rule” during the “many hours” they’ve played thus far.“The sprint speed, the arsenal, the game modes, and more are all firmly derived from some of the most successful online shooters of recent years. But by reinventing the way you move, Titanfall reinvents what it feels like to play a competitive shooter.” – Chris Watters, GameSpotWith Edge it’s all about potential. They make specific note, again, about how they’re going to be following up with additional notes once they see how this game plays in the real, retail market once it’s out. Other than that, it seems to be all positive.“The potential for launch week performance issues is the key issue holding Titanfall back from a recommendation at this stage, as is a triple-A pricepoint that many may find hard to justify for an exclusively multiplayer game. In its own right, though, this is arguably the best multiplayer shooter since the original Modern Warfare – and proof that beyond that well-used formula, a better game was waiting to be made.” – Edge OnlineFinally there’s Joystiq, a group which also seems to be ready to roll with a rating – they’ve given it 4.5 stars out of 5. They’ve also gone ahead and given his game a big high-five for the notion that it’s a change of pace – and a welcome one – in this environment.“It subsists on imbalance and the race to bear big arms first. It feeds on the fallout that results when equality means the other guy gets a robot too. Titanfall isn’t tuned to perfection for everyone yet, but it starts as a smart, swift and startling movement in well-traveled space.” – Ludwig Kietzmann, JoystiqAnd remember – SlashGear’s full in-depth Titanfall Review will be coming on shortly – stay tuned to our Titanfall tag portal for more! We’ll be speaking on both the Xbox One and PC version with more detail than your eyeballs can handle!

66	"Titanfall at launch will be running in 792p for the Xbox One, the same resolution that the beta ran. Respawn Entertainment's lead engineer Richard Baker confirmed this with Eurogamer and said they were working on ways to improve the visuals after launch.""We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target,"" Baker said.""We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it. For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship.""Titanfall comes out tomorrow for the Xbox One and PC. Get excited.

67	"Output resolutions are the talk of the town these days on both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4. Being the highly anticipated title that it is, Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall is under the review of the hungry eyes of gamers. On PC, we know that the game will output in the resolution that you so choose, but on Xbox One there's a different story. Titanfall on the Xbox One will launch at a resolution of 792p - the very same resolution as the beta build. But it might go higher.Last month Respawn's Community Manager Abbie Heppe stated that the resolution will ship at 792p but by the end of development, the game could ship at 900p. Eurogamer has reached out to Respawn's lead engineer Richard Baker to confirm the game's launch resolution and resolution boosting plans.""We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target,"" Baker told Digital Foundry (Eurogamer).Titanfall Launch Trailer Released, Slowmo Mechs are so Hot Right Now""We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it.""EA Cancels Titanfall Release In South Africa, Cites Poor Online PerformanceBaker then confirms that the game will not be shipping at an increased resolution from the beta and that the team probably won't have a patch in time for release, but odds are good for a patch post-release. ""For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship,"" Baker said.Baker then went on to talk about further optimization being done to the game and hoping to boost GPU performance for a more consistent 60fps throughout.""A lot of the performance is on the GPU side. There's still room for optimisation and we're still working on it [...] Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 all the time when we shipped but obviously when there's big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects... we're still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.""Titanfall has already shipped and is in the hands of some lucky players, so any improvements should be expected through online updates. The game will be available on March 11 on Xbox One and PC.Copyright © 2017  GAMENGUIDE All rights reserved."	Science
68	"Excited to pick up “Titanfall” for the Xbox One and PC on Tuesday? You’ll have to install a small update before you play the first-person shooter, according to players on Reddit. Buying a physical copy of the game requires purchasers to download an 840 megabyte, day-one patch before they can start destroying some bad guys. If you’re planning to get the game digitally, the patch will be included in the download.Microsoft is preparing for the much anticipated “Titanfall” launch on Tuesday. Chief Product Officer Marc Whitten took to the Xbox blog March 4 to explain the Xbox One March update, which began rolling out last week.In early February, Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq:MSFT) promised new Xbox One updates would lead to a better, improved “Titanfall” and overall gaming experience. “On March 4, in advance of what is expected to be the biggest game launch of the year, we will be delivering another system update to prepare your Xbox One for ‘Titanfall,’” Whitten posted on Microsoft’s Xbox blog on Feb. 5. “This update will contain many new features and improvements, most significantly to our party and multiplayer systems.”Microsoft previously launched a number of updates for the Xbox One on Feb. 11. Whitten also talked about these improvements, which include the ability to see and manage storage space, a battery power indicator, the ability to control one's install lineup and the usage of a USB keyboard with the Xbox One.“Xbox One is a platform for continuous innovation and new consumer experiences over time. Just as we did with Xbox 360, Xbox One will have regular updates to deliver new features and platform experiences designed to delight you. We’re always listening to you and we love your feedback, so keep it coming,"" he added.Whitten also assured players that Microsoft was learning a lot from their suggestions and complaints. “We have received lots of feedback since the launch of Xbox One in November and listening closely to you,” he assured players on March 4. “I’m excited to share that our second, and most significant, system update for Xbox One is starting to roll out today and includes improved matchmaking, party chat and friends features that will make gaming on Xbox One an experience like no other. To me that means playing games like ‘Titanfall’ on the best multiplayer service on the planet, using a new headset or the one you already own, while live broadcasting your games on Twitch.”Are you buying ""Titanfall"" tomorrow?

However, at the time Turn 10's creative director Dan Greenawalt said that the use of the cloud was restricted due to the speed of users' broadband globally.

From the artificial intelligence of the Titans to enemy and ally AI grunts, the cloud servers will crunch the data remotely. Local console resources can be used solely for the nuts and bolts of the game, to keep frame rates up, supply extra detail, etc.It is a groundbreaking use of the cloud, Respawn engineer Jon Shiring told Engadget.

73	"Respawn Entertainment is looking at ways to increase the resolution of Titanfall on the Xbox One with a post-launch update.Despite a report last month that Titanfall might launch at a higher resolution that the rather odd 792p of the beta release - 900p was the number being bandied about - it has now been confirmed that the game will run at the lower resolution when it ships. That's not necessarily the end of the road, however.""We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimize... we don't want to give up anything for higher res,"" Respawn Lead Engineer Richard Baker told Eurogamer. ""For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one.

75	My Titan is engulfed in flames and has only one bar of health left. I quickly use my vortex shield, hoping to catch the nimble Stryder Titan I’m battling against off guard. Luckily a salvo of the Stryder’s rockets get caught up in my Titan’s magnetic pull. I launch them back at my enemy, but it’s too late, a Pilot hiding on the roof of a nearby building fires their anti-Titan weapon and my Titan is destroyed in a massive explosion.My Pilot automatically ejects from the metallic beast, launching me hundreds of feet in the air. As I plummet towards the earth, I whip out my anti-titan rocket launcher and aim it directly at the Stryder.The missile hits my enemy just as my Pilot’s feet touch the ground and the Stryder explodes. This is Titanfall.Note: Additional opinion and information will be added to this Titanfall review when the game officially launches on March 11. Titanfall could suffer from significant launch day/week/month issues.The game reportedly suffered server connection issues, both on PC and the Xbox One, early this morning but Respawn claims the issues have been resolved. Respawn Entertainment’s new first-person shooter (FPS), Titanfall, has breathed new life into the stagnant genre and made me finally want to venture back into the often intimidating waters of Xbox Live multiplayer gaming.Titanfall’s verticality is what makes the game feel so different. Traditionally first-person shooters are very ground focused and often tied by the laws of gravity, but in Titanfall this isn’t the case.The Pilot’s free-running, parkour-style wall climbing and jetpacks means you always need to be on your toes. If you’re camping out on the roof of a building, picking off enemies at a distance, death can strike at any moment and in a variety of ways.Titanfall controls beautifully. You can really tell Respawn has spent a significant amount of time tweaking the game.A Pilot could jetpack and wall climb up the front of the building, jetpack across the map from a nearby structure, or even wall run from across the side of a nearby building, aim their sights at you, and blast you away before you even know where they are. This also makes Titanfall feel extremely fast and reminds me of older arena first-person shooters like Quake or Unreal, although it’s important to point out getting the hang of controlling the Pilot’s free-running and wall climbing does take some getting used to.Pilots also have the ability to take out Titans, a relatively miraculous gameplay balancing feat when you think about it. The anti-Titan weapon is powerful and with just a few rocket blasts or machine gun bullets, you can destroy a Titan. The trick is to make sure you’re always moving and using the Pilot’s unique wall running/climbing abilities. Speed and quick-thinking often helped me take down Titans as a Pilot.The game’s 15 maps range from wide-open Halo-style Blood Gulch maps to much smaller arena maps. Close-quarters combat can get a little hectic, but the game’s six on six player count keeps things from getting too chaotic. Since the game doesn’t include a traditional single-player campaign, having such a high number of multiplayer maps is almost a necessity. Also, many of the map layouts remind me of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and they probably should since many members of Respawn also worked on that particular genre-altering title.Wallrunning is an important skill to master in order to be successful in Titanfall.Then there’s the Titan — a giant hulking mech that truly makes you feel powerful (but not too powerful). If caught in the open as a pilot, Titan’s can easily make short work of you with just a few well placed bullets. Battles between Titans often amount to a game of cat and mouse — hiding behind buildings, recharging the mech’s vortex shield, all while trying to out gun your opponent and dodge a Pilot’s anti-Titan weapons. Titans feel like the giant, metallic beasts you’d expect them to, but they’re also still vulnerable. The balance Respawn has managed to create between Titans and Pilots is impressive and quite an accomplishment.Surprisingly I have much more fun playing as a Pilot in Titanfall rather than a Titan. Titans may be powerful but they’re also slow and after bounding across a map as a nimble Pilot, I rarely opt to enter the mech. Occasionally it makes sense to jump into a Titan, but it all comes down to timing and what’s going on in the multiplayer match at that given time. I enjoy free-running as a pilot so much that it’s going to be difficult to go back to games like Battlefield 4 or Call of Duty: Ghosts.Custom and pre-created loadouts for both Titans and Pilots, as well as unlockable weapon upgrades, all standard features with most modern first-person shooters, are all present in the game and surprisingly refreshingly simple. Games like the Call of Duty franchise have over complicated the upgrade process, making creating your ideal loadout an intimidating process.ft I never thought I’d say it, but I’m actually excited about a first-person shooter for the first time in awhile.Burn cards also add a little more variety to the mix. They’re different bonuses, like an extra powerful weapon or a Titan class you haven’t unlocked yet, in the form of cards set before the beginning of each match. Burn cards are also earned by accomplishing different in-game challenges. Knowing when to use a burn card is very important and they’re also great for breaking a continuous frustrating death streak.Interestingly, the final version of Titanfall running on the Xbox One actually looks better than what I experienced in both the game’s beta and alpha builds. Still, it probably isn’t the huge graphical leap forward some people are expecting from the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and the game does occasionally suffer from annoying graphical tears, especially when it’s moving at a fast pace.Titanfall is missing three glaring features though. The absence of local-multiplayer, a disturbingly common trait in games these days, is very disappointing. Normally this wouldn’t bother me very much, but Titanfall is the first game in years that actually could get a group of my friends together for a Halo: Combat Evolved style LAN party.This Pilot doesn’t look like they’re going to survive much longer.Also, there isn’t any way to create custom game types right now, although this feature is rumoured to be added to the game at some point through an update.Then there’s the missing features that always seem pop up in interviews and stories; Titanfall’s lack of a real single-player campaign. Respawn can dance around the question as much as they like, throwing out buzz words like “campaign-multiplayer,” but for many gamers Titanfall’s lack of single-player is a deal breaker. The included campaign mode merely dresses up the game’s multiplayer with a loose story focused on the battle between the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) and the militia, with the occasional brief cut scene. It’s a welcome addition to the multiplayer-only game and can be entertaining at times, but it isn’t a true campaign.Fans of the Call of Duty or Halo franchises will also take issue with the game’s AI controlled Grunts and Spectres, non-player characters included in the game to give noobs something to kill and flesh out some of Titanfall’s more expansive maps. I’ll admit the AI controlled bots do get frustrating at times, especially when a team scores the final points in a game of Attrition (Titanfall’s fancy word for deathmatch) by taking out a few Spectres. I enjoyed the inclusion of Grunts and Spectres and I think it will make the game much more accessible for many players.Titans are giant hulking beasts that are difficult to maneuver.One of the questions that still remain about Titanfall is whether or not the game will perform under launch day stress, when presumably millions of people log into the game on March 11th. During Titanfall’s beta there were very few issues and when Respawn finally activated the game’s servers again just a few days ago, while it was difficult to find a match in certain playlists, this won’t be an issue when Titanfall officially launches. Still, it’s very possible the launch of the game will be a complete mess.I grew up playing first-person shooters like the Halo 2 and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare but over the last few years, I’ve gotten tired of the genre. For awhile I thought maybe I’d just grown out of the whole idea of an FPS, but after spending time with Titanfall, I’ve realized I just needed to play a first-person shooter that approaches the genre in an original way.Titanfall won’t be for everyone, especially those looking for a single-player experience, but if you’re into multiplayer FPS games, this is one game you really shouldn’t miss. It doesn’t completely change what gamers have come to expect from first-person shooters but instead alters it just enough to feel fresh again.Titanfall is set to be released on March 11 for PC and Xbox One. An Xbox 360 version will drop later in March on the 25, although not much is known about the difference between the current-generation and next-generation versions of the game.Follow me on Twitter: @Patrick_ORourke. Video games are an increasingly important form of artistic expression and storytelling.

76	"Titanfall is strictly coiled around the player. You couldn't excise even one piece without slackening it like a ruined kidnapper's rope. The serpentine level design, the liberating sense of movement, the flawless controls and yes, the enormous bipedal tanks dropping from the sky, are equally indispensable in this arresting shooter.Given the studio's splintered status as a former Call of Duty custodian, Respawn Entertainment has made a multiplayer game fit for those who have spent years peering through the eyes of a speedy killing machine – a seasoned six against six in battles for land or a higher kill count. A history with rapid-fire aim and fleet-footed 3D movement is not essential here, but recommended.

					It may have a throwaway story and and a few technical issues, but Titanfall is still a first-person shooter that pushes the genre forward.Ejecting from a giant Titan, flying up into the air and hurtling back down towards the ground is one of Titanfall’s greatest achievements. Wall-running across an entire map, bouncing off structures and lifting yourself up to a higher ledge to take out an enemy pilot – that’s another. Crushing foes like squeezing tomatoes, stamping your feet like a 3-year old child being pulled out of play-school – it’s a feeling that only comes from Titanfall. If first-person shooters have felt stale for some time, the team at Respawn has done its damnedest to freshen them up.“Titanfall’s campaign is so drowned out by the gameplay that I have no clue what was happening in the top right of the HUD where the game feeds you mini-cutscenes.”It’s hard to write an article about a new shooter without mentioning Call of Duty, and Titanfall is as fine-tuned as a once-famous captain’s moustache. Playing it, you soon realise the agonizing hours that have been put into balancing this behemoth. With all the attention put into this game, the studio deserves as many medals as have already been pinned to its chest since the game first began winning over the press. You can feel the crafting that has gone into the game; from the man versus machine gameplay of pilots fighting Titans, to the burn card perks, the wall running, wall-hanging and even vertical gameplay. The game is so well balanced that its as though these guys have been doing this sort of thing for years… Multiplayer is the new campaign You can’t play Titanfall without an internet connection. At the time of release, if you’ve got no internet, Titanfall is just an intro video on a blu-ray disc. This is a multiplayer game, don’t buy it if you want a single-player experience because it’s not here. And that applies even more so when it comes to a notable story campaign.Campaign Multiplayer hooks you up into online matches of 6 versus 6 in which the IMC and Militia battle it out. Each side gets its own story. But what that story is, well, I couldn’t give you the foggiest idea of what happened during my time with it. I just remember a lot of bangs and explosions, which is exactly what I came to the game for. Titanfall’s campaign is so drowned out by the gameplay and high-paced action that I have no clue what was happening in the top right of the HUD where the game feeds you mini-cutscenes. It’s like a blur in your vision. There’s mention of leviathans (monsters/dinosaurs/whatever we’re calling them now) – these are simply a colourful addition to the game. You can gain points for shooting terrordactyl-type creatures but you won’t be fighting off a 3000 foot Torvosaurus. You can’t choose to play single missions either, you just jump into a lobby and have to deal with it. At this point the game will do its best to create a lobby for the mission you’ve gotten up to in the campaign. This is an issue that I’ve been told will be fixed post-launch.Capture the Flag 2.0Capture the flag is a crowd favourite; the old timer. It’s a game mode that over the years has barely changed in shooters. It has always been a flat playground to run and jump your way back to home. The rules haven’t changed yet, but what Titanfall offers is something that truly makes the game worthwhile once more. You can use your Titan to get away with the flag. You can wall-run, you can use your abilities to assist you with your getaway and zipline your way to safety. Putting all this together, Titanfall manages to reboot Capture the Flag and make it exciting again because it all comes together – the flag grab, the jump into a Stryder (the fastest of the Titans), the dart back across the map under fire. Ejecting from a doomed Titan last minute, through the air and straight into through the roof of your base. Flag captured, game over. You win.Titan-fallsTitans are huge, they’re something to behold and definitely not to be messed with. Dropping your Titan on top of another doesn’t get old. But as smooth as the game can be, some of Titanfall’s smaller maps can feel restrictive when the game struggles to cope with confined spaces. The sense of scale that the game so successfully created elsewhere begins to break. “There are situations where the game completely throws a hissy fit and jarring technical issues slap you around the face.”Ninety percent of the time you’ll suffer no issues with Titanfall on the Xbox One. But there are situations where the game completely throws a hissy fit and jarring technical issues slap you around the face. It might not screw up the overall match – and the fights carry on with all the usual intensity – but the framerate drops and the screen tears for around 4-5 seconds. This happened at least ten times during the two days we were playing the game in EA’s controlled environment, and we’ve noticed it happening online since then.If that’s what happens on the Xbox One, I dread to see what happens during those rare moments on the Xbox 360. But despite these technical issues, Titanfall will undoubtedly become the shooter that changed the first-person shooter for a new generation. The  mechanics under the hood of Titanfall are phenomenal. Hopefully we’ll see Xbox’s new Xbox Live Compute infrastructure thrive off the traffic – eating it for breakfast and asking for more, but we can never be 100 percent certain during these early days. As with all online games, there’s a certain amount of faith the player has to put into it and patience in the early weeks as Respawn and EA rolls out updates to strengthen the service.  In short? Get involved. You’ll look back on the day where you first played Titanfall. You’ll remember the first time you ejected over your Titan and crashed back into the battlefield. Titanfall is a game that inspires stories and you’ll shortly have your own to tell. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Great news: you get to keep playing Titanfall! Less-great news: you only get to play with other cheaters. You can play with other banned players in something that will resemble the Wimbledon of aimbot contests. Hopefully the aimbot cheat you paid for really is the best, or these all-cheater matches could be frustrating for you. Good luck. Q.) If I'm banned, what happens if I make a party with my non-cheater friends? A.) When anyone in your party is banned, then everyone in your party will be treated as banned for that play session. If you are a non-cheater and you invite a cheater friend into a party, you will be stuck playing against cheaters. If you stop inviting your cheater friend, you will once again get to play with the non-cheater population. You do not get permanently tainted just by playing with a cheater - you are only banned for cheating if you are actually cheating.	Science

Real EstateCould giant robots turn the tide of the console race?iNVEZZ.com, Monday, March 10: Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is hoping that it could gain an advantage in the video game console race with the help of giant robots.In November last year, Microsoft released its first new video game console in eight years, the Xbox One, but some of the company’s decisions in the months prior to the launch prompted criticism. Xbox One sales have so far been lagging Sony Corp’s new console, the PlayStation 4, which also launched in November, priced $100 lower than Microsoft’s offering in the US.However, the Redmond-based software giant believes that the tide could start turning tomorrow, when ‘Titanfall’, a first person shooting game hits the stores in the US. In today’s trading, Microsoft shares were 0.1 percent down at $37.83 as of 13:42 UTC.Game changer?Microsoft’s Xbox One debuted with strong sales, but apparently not enough to overcome its rival Sony in the early stages of the latest console war.  According to estimates from researcher NPD Group, the PlayStation outsold the Xbox One in January by at least a 2-to-1 margin in Microsoft’s home market, the US. On March 4, the Japanese company revealed that the PlayStation 4 had sold six million units since its November 15 launch. In contrast Microsoft hasn’t released Xbox One sales figures since the start of this year, a sign that they may be weaker than expected. It appears the US giant needs a considerable boost to catch up with its Japanese peer. According to Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group, Titanfall may provide such a fillip.“It’s hard to overstate the importance of Titanfall to the Xbox One release this year,” Bloomberg Businessweek last week quoted Mehdi as saying. “For us, it’s a game changer. It’s a system seller.”Titanfall, a first person shooter (FPS) that focuses on multiplayer battles with futuristic weapons and giant robots, has already generated a lot of buzz amongst players; its open beta version attracted more than two million players, overloading some of Xbox One’s servers. While not entirely exclusive to Xbox One, Titanfall will not appear on PlayStation 4, meaning that players who want to experience the game will have to play it either on Microsoft’s console or on PC.For Titanfall’s US launch, Microsoft is rolling out an Xbox One bundle priced at $499 that includes a free copy of Titanfall, which by itself will retail for $59.99. In the UK, the company announced a price cut to £399 (from £429) for the Xbox One from 28 February and Titanfall will be included in the package, for a limited time, at no additional charge from 14 March.As of 14:17 UTC buy Microsoft shares at $37.83As of 14:17 UTC sell Microsoft shares at $37.81Website Terms of Use By accessing and using this website, you agree to the following terms of

A normal match of Titanfall is going to include at least two ""Did you see that?!"" moments. Like, two separate times where you literally say, ""Did you see that?"" Out loud. It might be when you dash through a ruined building, jump kicking half a dozen AI-controlled grunts to death. It might be when you pounce from rooftop to rooftop and barely make the leap to the evac ship as enemies try desperately to take you down. Or it might be when you eject from your doomed titan in the heat of a battle and watch from the sky as its nuclear core explodes, taking out every foe within a block. But no matter your skill level, and no matter how badly you're winning or losing, you're still going to feel the urge to scream, ""Did you see that!?"" because Titanfall--despite a few shortcomings--is a game that demands to be seen.You'll be amazed by how much is going on at any given time on the screen, even on the Xbox 360 version, which looks and plays almost exactly like its next-gen counterpart. The online-only FPS takes mechanics from popular modern shooters and mixes in new ideas to make for something that looks absolutely astounding. You're not battling in the streets of empty cities, you're fighting alongside AI soldiers, piloting massive mechs, and shooting at enemy players that can tumble through windows and run up walls. You kill fast, die fast, and move faster than you do in most other shooters, making for short, brutal matches that you'll want to keep playing again and again. When you get into the groove of things, playing matches of Titanfall feels like munching on potato chips; good luck having just one.If you were to strip away the unique elements you'd be left with a core that feels pretty familiar (which makes sense, considering the developer's history of making Call of Duty games), but that's easier said than done. The parkour? Those giant mechs? The AI minions? They're the bread and butter of the Titanfall experience. Minions might seem to be the least important cog in the machine because they're not as sexy as wall-running or mechs, but they serve the vital role of making every match feel bigger than it otherwise would. Though there are only 12 players in a session, there are at least twice that many AI-controlled allies and enemies running around at any given time. They skip around the battlefield and fight side-by-side with you, though they sometimes blow themselves up in absolutely remarkable displays of stupidity. AI units are downright dim-witted, which often leads to them staring at you like deer in headlights while you wave a shotgun in their faces. Their function is to die rather than kill, to fill the streets with corpses and serve as a morale booster.The Xbox 360 version of Titanfall was actually handled by separate developer, and it did a fantastic job of bringing the larger-than-life battles of Titanfall to the last-gen hardware. The gameplay is virtually identical, and it doesn't look a huge deal worse. There's some screen tearing and the lower resolution means it's harder to see enemies far away, but those are really the biggest issues. Basically, it feels like the Xbox One version is on a PC running at High settings, and the Xbox 360 version is on a PC running Medium. That's it. The battles are just as fast, the AI is equally as stupid, you can still run on walls and drop massive mechs on enemies.Minions also deliver short bits of story as you encounter them, be it by chatting about the battle or fighting enemies in well-animated hand-to-hand combat. Honestly, you'll likely get more enjoyment out of those bits of narrative than you will from the story elements of the game's lackluster campaign. Though wholly inoffensive, the multiplayer-online campaign is basically a one and a half hour playlist of multiplayer matches sandwiched between 20-second audio clips where characters gab about a war and talk about their history. They keep chatting as you play, discussing their plans as you compete in fairly standard games of Team Deathmatch and Capture Point (augmented with the occasional in-game cutscene). Win or lose, the story still moves forward, making your battles feel meaningless, and you feel like an NPC in someone else's story. Once the uninteresting tale ends you'll do it again as the other faction, playing the same matches in the same maps except with different characters talking to you, because it's the only way to unlock all of the titans.Playing through the campaign gives you time to learn how to take advantage of the parkour in a slightly less-competitive setting, an addition that raises Titanfall's skill ceiling tremendously. Being able to travel anywhere, on any wall, is incredibly freeing, and you might have trouble playing a first-person shooter without it afterwards. And in the rare instance it doesn't work perfectly, and you either clip through a wall or simply fail to grab a ledge for no discernable reason, you're still going to love the simple act of running and jumping more than you have in almost any FPS. It also means that the game's maps--all 15 of them--are constructed with verticality and multiple levels of explorable playspace, making for impressive level design (even if many of the locations look and feel overly similar).Besides being able to facilitate a dozen pilots jumping between buildings and running on walls, the maps are also capable of comfortably housing a bunch of huge robots engaging in massive battles. Titans are awe-inspiring--even the act of calling one down from the sky is awesome. There's a rumbling, you hear the crackling of a giant metal monster tearing through the atmosphere, and then they smash into the ground in a deafening thud. If you manage to have one land on an enemy titan, it'll destroy it outright; talk about a ""Xbox! Record that!"" moment.While titans are basically walking tanks, their maneuverability and customizability makes them much more fun. You're able to outfit your titan with different types of weapons and abilities, leading to hundreds of ways to approach going into battle. Want one that can make quick work of large groups of soldiers? Cool, slap a lightning gun on that sucker, give it the Tactical Ability that lets it shoot out Pilot-killing Electric Smoke, and watch as the sparks fly. Want to make a lean, mean titan-killing machine? Give that son of a bitch some big cannons, choose the shield that lets you catch projectiles and throw them back, and blast enemies into scrap. You can even treat them like giant, metal bodyguards by stepping out and letting the AI take over. They're much less proficient without a pilot inside, but the ability to have them guard a location or follow you around adds a multitude of strategic depth.And though titans feel so powerful you'll want to run when one rounds a corner (one cash in your direction and they can literally just step on you) they never feel unbalanced. Every pilot can carry one of five anti-titan weapons, capable of doing massive damage to the armored mechs if you're able to get a good angle. Plus, you're also able to jump on their back, tear off a chunk of armor, and shoot directly into the titan while riding it like a bull in a rodeo, which A) is really useful and fun, and B) is cool as shit, yo.When you mix together all of these unique elements, you're left with gameplay that's relentlessly cool. You'll run along a wall like a boss, hitch a ride on the back of an allied titan, and then shoot at stupid minions as the metal monster runs around the map; or you'll call down a titan of your own and get it to follow you as you sneak through buildings, picking off enemy pilots that are jumping along rooftops. Some of the most memorable moments happen during the Epilogue, where the losing team can escape on a dropship to earn a little experience boost. It might seem minor, but the mad dash for the ship--and the knowledge that you'll piss off the team that just beat you if you make it--is a much more fulfilling conclusion than simply seeing the word ""Defeat"" pop up on the screen after a loss.Titanfall's character development system follows a progression you're likely familiar with, including 50 levels of advancement in which you can unlock weapons, perks, and Burn Cards--short, one-time-use buffs that expire upon death. Compared to other shooters, the list of unlockables is somewhat paltry. On the one hand, this means that the focus is more on skill rather than weapon grinding, but it also means there's a lack of Pilot customization that might make you feel as though your choices are limited.But it's not all sunshine and robot battles. Whereas the gameplay is an artful evolution of the standard FPS formula, the innovation stops when it gets to the game modes, which are downright stale in comparison. There's Capture the Flag, Capture Point (called Hardpoint Domination), two kinds of Team Deathmatch (Attrition and Pilot Hunter), and Last Titan Standing, which is a round-based mode where everyone starts with a titan and you don't respawn after death. They're all augmented and improved with parkour, minions, and titans, but with exception of Last Titan Standing, these are all game types you've played before (and, honestly, even LTS isn't fundamentally different). Though you're doing cool stuff all the time, you're doing it in the same context as you are in just about every other shooter out there, and it's a bit disappointing.Titanfall's moving parts complement each other well, and take a familiar FPS formula and make it feel fresh--it's just a shame that it relies so heavily on the familiar. You'll eventually hit a point--like you do in nearly every game--where you feel as though you've done everything there is to do, and because you're still just playing Team Deathmatch or Capture the Flag, that time comes quicker than you might think. But while that holds Titanfall back from being a true revolution, you'll still have a damn good time dropping titans from space and kicking enemies in the head, all the while screaming ""did you see that?!"" at your TV.Titanfall blends familiar concepts with innovative ideas in remarkable ways, leading to a nearly nonstop supply of awesome moments. But for as fun as it is, you'll likely find yourself wishing Respawn was more ambitious when it comes to game modes, since there's a good chance you've captured enough flags for one lifetime.This game was reviewed on Xbox One.Get the best gaming deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable gaming news and more!GamesRadar+ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

An online-only shooter like Titanfall is the kind of game you can only fully evaluate on live servers against the full universe of players, so we won’t have a complete review of the game until later this week. We were able to get some quality time with the near-final build of the Xbox One version of the game this weekend, though, playing alongside fellow journalists and developers from EA and Respawn. That time was enough to develop some general impressions of the title beyond our extensive time with the beta.The biggest addition over the beta release is in the campaign mode, which takes nine normal six-on-six multiplayer matches on specific maps and dresses them up with a thin veneer of story. A hardpoint area-capturing match might turn into a battle to secure anti-aircraft guns to protect a planet from an invasion (or to protect the invading force, on the other side). A kill-them-all Attrition battle on a dry desert planet turns into a key battle to secure the only convenient fueling station in that area of space.These scenarios are laid out somewhat elegantly in 15 seconds or so of voice-over just before each battle starts and through a quick spoken recap of the consequences of your victory or defeat during the match’s final moments. They’re also sometimes punctuated by impressive visual compositions during the introduction. One battle begins with a large wave of AI grunts charging in D-Day style, while another starts with the planet’s native, pterodactyl-like creatures swooping down to take out some incidental grunts (too bad they don’t seem to have much effect on the rest of the match).None of this affects the gameplay at all, and it really only provides the barest sense of narrative context for the battles. More than an advancing plot, the story simply hammers home the general impression of a hackneyed, never-ending conflict between an evil space empire and the scrappy militia rebels. That conflict continues on more or less unchanged whether you win or lose, which lowers the narrative stakes quite a bit (to be fair, I was not able to get through all the campaign missions for either side, owing to a lack of opponents during the pre-release weekend).While not objectionable in any way, I feel like most players are going to blaze through both campaigns to unlock the requisite Titan chassis in a couple of hours or so, then promptly forget about it amid hundreds of hours of the standard multiplayer.Outside of the campaign, there are two new multiplayer modes that have been added since the beta. Capture the flag is like every capture the flag mode you’ve ever played in a shooter, except now there are Titans running around. Pilot Hunter mode is more interesting, giving players points only for killing human players and not for AI grunts or Titans. I felt like this blunted the importance of some of the game’s most interesting additions, but it’s a good corrective for players tired of their opponents farming grunts for points in Attrition mode.The full game also opens up a number of weapons and abilities that are unlocked the more you play, in the modern multiplayer tradition. The most interesting I’ve stumbled across so far is the particle wall, a permeable barrier that allows a Titan to shoot out but stops opponents from shooting in. I’ll let Sam talk about the variety of new maps we got to try out this weekend.All in all, my initial feeling is that Titanfall remains a refreshing change of pace for an increasingly tired genre, for all the reasons laid out in our beta impressions. With most first-person shooters these days, I get a “been-there-done-that” feeling after playing for just a couple of hours. Titanfall is the first shooter in a while that feels fresh enough that I want to play a lot more after an entire weekend of bingeing.The first thing you might notice in Titanfall’s battlegrounds is a mass of dragons flying around. One of the arenas, dubbed Boneyard, is a giant, hilly desert covered with enormous, sun-bleached dinosaur skulls, and its skies are overrun with winged beasts. The monsters only show up in one of the game’s 15 maps at launch, and they serve no gameplay purpose, at least as far as we can tell. You can’t ride them or shoot them down. Nothing remotely similar appears on any other map in the game.The same can be said for pretty much every map that Titanfall ships with, really. The selection doesn’t have much consistency in its aesthetic theme, other than an affinity for vibrant color palettes, robot-friendly expanses of terrain, large draw distances, and unnecessary craziness floating in the sky (more often giant spaceships than dragons).The first two maps revealed during the Titanfall beta set a pretty good archetype for how the rest of the retail game has turned out. Namely, maps have been laid out to guarantee plenty of room for the game’s Titans to run wildly and for the weaker pilots to hide and scurry. For the most part, these elements have been rendered as giant, organic settings; the most striking are probably the water-drenched environs of Smuggler’s Cove and Lagoon, whose various buildings and outposts sit alongside sunset-kissed rivers and lakes.One particularly impressive map, named Relic, sees its two halves divided by a dormant and astonishingly huge aircraft carrier; the design offers just enough openings for Titans to run in and raise pilot-killing terror while still giving pilots a ton of tactical edge. Meanwhile, Corporate is the opposite in terms of “organic” feel; it’s mostly made up of giant, dilapidated offices at an abandoned tech company’s headquarters, but its mix of giant, rounded domes and climbable, broken interiors stands out as something rarely achieved in FPS map design.Sadly, a few of the maps feel more like they could have been rendered in Halo’s Forge toolset. In particular, Demeter is mostly boxes and right angles, while other maps reduce Titans’ best routes to circuits outside of the maps’ biggest buildings, meaning that your giant mechs wind up chasing each other, round and round, until someone else spawns to create a two-on-one advantage. Maps like this make the game’s lack of level design/customization a little tough to swallow.While the game’s pilots are incredibly mobile, able to double-jump and wall-run, Respawn doesn’t really use these powers to push level design in a vertical direction. Rather, buildings tend to just be spaced out a little further, requiring that you double-jump or wall-run to get to obviously telegraphed points. The speed and jump-crazy mechanics feel great at first, of course, especially in the abandoned-town setting of Colony. Eventually, however, the need to jump all over the place leaves your pilots too exposed, and smarter players will retreat to the more boring, cushy corners of those maps or, worse, to the few high-and-isolated sniping posts that most maps seem to hide.In all, the game has at least six absolutely great maps, which is a more than reasonable ratio considering how FPS games tend to launch. As of press time, though, it seems that Titanfall doesn’t include a private/unranked way of selecting an exact roster of maps: even if you party up, you’ll have to rotate through the good, the fine, and the boring in public matchmaking. Hopefully, that will receive a toggle or fix in the near future.We can't say the same about our hopes for rideable dragons; we'll just have to enjoy those tremendous robots in the meantime.When creating Ultima Online, Richard Garriott had grand dreams. He and Starr Long planned on implementing a virtual ecology into their massively multiplayer online role-playing game. It was an ambitious system, one that would have cows that graze and predators that eat herbivores. However, once the game went live a small problem had arisen...You must login or create an account to comment."	Science
84	Above: EA's Titanfall is a recent bright spot for the company.Check out our Reviews Vault for past game reviews.I’ll make this easy: Everything that anyone’s ever said and speculated on Titanfall is correct.“It’s going to be great!” say the Xbox fanboys. True.“It’s multiplayer only, so it can’t be that great!” claim the naysayers. Also true.Publisher Electronic Arts and developer Respawn Entertainment release the ultrahyped Titanfall this week for the Xbox One and PC (and later this month for the Xbox 360). The military-style first-person shooter is similar in mechanics and tone to the Call of Duty games — which shouldn’t surprise anyone given that a lot of the same people who worked on that series formed Respawn.While Titanfall will be instantly familiar and comfortable to Call of Duty players, it distinguishes itself with its highly nimble soldiers (called “pilots”) and the giant mechanized, walking tanks (called “Titans”) that they climb into and command. It’s almost difficult to go back to COD at this point, with its grounded, slow-by-comparison characters who don’t get to skip around using mini-jetpacks or drive four-story-tall death-dealing mechs. But Titanfall doesn’t necessarily give enough reasons to hang around for the long-term, either.Besides giant mechs, you mean?While Titanfall’s cover models are its monstrous Titans of course, you can’t dismiss its people-sized pilots, who are quite fun to play on their own. Counterintuitively, you may even purposely avoid playing as a Titan to run around in the flesh.In almost all of Titanfall’s fairly standard modes (kill everyone, hold a point, capture the flag, etc.), you start each match as a pilot armed with a fairly normal primary weapon (assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, etc.). You’re also equipped with a sidearm, an anti-Titan weapon (heavier weapons like shoulder-mounted rocket launchers designed to take down the big guys), and some additional gear or abilities that include grenades, radar enhancements, cloaking abilities, and more. (Yes, character customization — down to the type of scope you put on your guns — is very similar to what you’ve seen in Call of Duty without the more superficial options like the ability to swap out your sight’s red dot with a purple smiley face.)But every pilot has their personal jump kit as well, and these — perhaps more so than the Titans themselves — are really what give the game its own identity. Once you’ve had a taste of double-jumping, wall-running, and parkour-like agility that the kits provide, it makes comparable military shooters like COD or Battlefield feel, well, less comparable.It helps that all of the levels are vast enough to accommodate multiple Titans battling it out yet contain plenty of indoor areas and smart vertical design to make running around as a pilot feel just as empowering (giving up raw strength for cat-like maneuverability). The tradeoff, however, is that the overall speed may be a bit too much for less experienced gamers, negating some of Titanfall’s newbie friendliness (more on that below).And with heavy-duty anti-Titan weaponry — plus the ability to climb on top of enemy mechs to bypass shields and rip out key components to expose more delicate innards that don’t hold up well against regular ol’ bullets — you’ll never feel shortchanged on the not-so-tall side of the pilot-Titan dynamic.But what about those giant mechs?As you scamper about as a pilot, picking up a kill here and there, you start building up anticipation for the big prize: “Titanfall.” An onscreen timer backed by audio cues from your in-game dispatcher (“Your Titan will be ready in 30 seconds”) counts down to when you can summon your tower of doom. As you eliminate enemies, the time to Titanfall lessens, speeding up the arrival of your new ride.	Science
85	It's Titanfall day, people. Are you prepared for a parkour-filled, multiplayer-only, first-person shooter experience? We've been playing for days and have a few tips on how to best take advantage of all its neat features.We're not ready for an official review just yet. Servers only just went live and we want to make sure everything is running smoothly. We'll give it a few days, play with the public some more (cause I've mostly only played with media/EA/Respawn). So in the meantime I thought I should share some starter tips to keep in mind before everyone starts installing this one.If you haven&apos;t played Titanfall yourself yet, you may be one of those wondering: what the hell …As you level up you'll unlock other pilot tactical abilities, but cloaking is one of my favorites so far. I saw a lot of people using it prematurely, though, which is a mistake because it doesn't last too long. You don't wanna use it the moment you spawn and are running into the heart of the map. You'll want to use it at the most opportune moments, like hunting someone down from a distance, while in a dark corridor, to nail a Titan with your anti-titan weaponry, etc. Keep in mind that you're still easy to spot if you're running around frantically while cloaked, and it'll break the second you start shooting. The best use of the cloak, though, is against a Titan. They can't see the same opaque figure that pilots can notice if they look hard enough, so you can use the ability to sneak up on a Titan and crawl up its back to execute it. AdvertisementIt's actually very easy to look back at your shields to see they've not only plummeted but so has your health bar. Often Titan-on-Titan battles can be distracting, but you'll want to keep an eye out for pilots who are targeting you. They're harder to spot, can shoot at you from cover and deplete your health fairly quickly on their own. While you're managing the field and fending off other Titans, you should make ample use of your dash ability to avoid getting hit. It's imperative that you avoid taking as much damage as possible, just as if you were a feeble meat vessel running around on foot. This is a tip for pilots, too, in that you shouldn't shy away from taking Titans on. The anti-titan weaponry are incredibly useful, and your relatively small size comes at a huge advantage. Titanfall has one of the most fluctuating battle conditions I've seen in a first-person shooter. That means that players are all over the place. One minute someone's spin-kicked you to death from the ground and the next that same person managed to parkour their way up to the top of a tower and are trying to snipe you from there. It's fast-paced in a way most shooters aren't, simply because of the freedom of movement and world scalability. So to prepare yourself somewhat, you'll want to keep an eye on your map. There are some Burn Cards—which are basically perks you can activate after death for one life—as well as modifications to your pilot that will increase your map and enemy visibility, but it should be enough that you are constantly familiar with what you're about to run into. Though the map isn't always an exact, live representation of what's going on either. So you'll have to keep that in mind if you do decide to trail those dots. It's certainly a helpful indicator to which part of the map is the most active, though.AdvertisementThis isn't just a tip for the moment-to-moment fighting, it's particularly important at the end of each round. If your team has just lost, you'll be directed to an evacuation ship that is usually on the top of some building. It can be nerve-wracking to try to figure your way up it if it's your first time scaling that building. But if you've been spending the entire round climbing and jumping up buildings, it'll feel a little bit more natural and expedite the whole process. Time is very, very precious during the epilogue of each round. The same goes for the opposing team who is trying to get to that marked location on the map to stop the losing team from escaping. Plus, it's just fun to do and you can tell the maps have been designed for it. I've already seen people pull off some awesome-looking tricks, and doing the same yourself, if you can manage it, is exhilarating. Oh, and when you do find yourself waiting at an extraction point to board your evac ship, be sure to hide around the pickup area, not right in plain sight or even behind cover on that platform. Wait to run up only just before the ship is prepared to leave, and you'll want to save your cloaking ability for just the right moment, too. Otherwise you will get hunted, viciously and without remorse. The final epilogue stand is always a bloodbath. They're a little bit like the perks you might be familiar with in a lot of the Call of Duty franchise, except they don't feel as overpowered. They're expendable in that you are given the option to use one only after you die and that lasts only for that one next respawn/life. Most of them aren't huge bonuses either—a lot add to your sprint speed or give your weapons an extra boost—but some more rare ones will give you double the experience points and other fun things. But I found myself constantly forgetting to equip these at each death. I would be so excited to jump right back in that I'd miss the step to pick whichever one of the Burn Cards I'd equipped while sitting, bored, in the game's lobby before the round started. So I'd always plan on using them, but forget to take that one second to select it post-death. The trick is just to not die immediately after selecting it for that particular respawn. It's happened. It sucks (especially if it's that double XP one).AdvertisementThis one should really go without saying but when the game's main goal is to kill, kill, kill, it sometimes makes people forget that the most effective way to kill is to band together. My worst rounds were always at the hands of the most coordinated teams. They'd have Titans fighting side-by-side, pilots fending off other pilots who were either sneakily trying to anti-titan the Titans or climb up their backs to shoot the wiring out of their heads. Sheer numbers of generous and thoughtful teammates are too much for even the cleverest, sneakiest of players trying to fell them. This tactic is particularly useful for Titans, and you'll find that you survive far longer as a Titan with some support. That's the way to win, and that's the way to play on a more complex level. I've spoken a lot about how much I love that Titanfall has fodder AI, but the more avid, experienced first-person shooter players should look for a more satisfying challenge. Grunts are super easy to kill, don't shoot too often and don't move around too much either. If they get in the way I'll always shoot them, and they do help to grind to higher levels as well as speed up your time-until-Titanfall counter, but I like to focus my energy on the tougher kills. For those players who are finding themselves dying too often in rounds and disadvantaged by their lower-grade weapons, the grunts are actually perfect enemies. You can feel like you're contributing, like you have some measure of success, and you can hurry yourself up towards getting those shinier guns with better modifications. Either way, the grunts are something to think about.AdvertisementI know; it seems absurd in a game where you punch metal skeletons to tell you not to get in a metal skeleton and start punching other metal skeletons. Especially when it's so fun. But there are a few reasons why I'm suggesting this. For one thing, it can also be a lot of fun (and very effective) to hunt down Titans as a tiny pilot. You often risk getting stomped on if you attempt close encounters, but even that is always a laugh. Mostly you'll be trying to hide from a Titan as you unload your anti-titan weapon on them and snigger at yourself as the Titan whips around and shoots rockets at nothing while trying to find your location. But remember that your Titan gets rebuilt fairly quickly. So—and this is where the second piece to this tip comes in—you can always decide to drop your Titan and tell it to either follow you or guard a location. I found this method especially useful during Titanfall's version of Capture the Flag, which I managed to play briefly in my time with the game so far. You can drop a Titan to guard an area around your flag while you make a run for the other team's flag. Now you're racking up kills from both sides of the map. Bam. Efficiency. Snipers have always been a concern in shooters, but keeping an eye up is especially important in Titanfall for that and other reasons. There are many vantage points for a distance shooter to choose from, and because the parkour element is so fun, you'll see lots of people jumping around on rooftops killing each other or on a Titan hunt. Watching the rooftops means spotting a potential kill or avoiding death; either way, it's useful to be mindful of. And if you're looking for more pilot kills and less AI running around, your chances of finding the human players are better at that height.

86	March 10, 201412:00 PM EDT[np_storybar title=”Titanfall review coming Thursday” link=””]It’s been a rough year for high profile games with an online focus.Several games, most notably Sim City and Battlefield 4 — both produced by the same publisher, Electronic Arts — did not perform as advertised when they were first opened to the public.Post Arcade has spent some early hands-on time with Titanfall, but are withholding a full scored review until we are able to test the online-only game in real-world conditions when the servers go public on Tuesday.A full review will be posted on Thursday.[/np_storybar]COMMENTMicrosoft Corp. has a lot riding on Titanfall, the new game from developer Respawn Entertainment, the creators of the blockbuster Call of Duty series.The world’s largest software company reportedly spent big bucks to keep the game away from Sony’s rival PlayStation platforms, and the company clearly sees Titanfall as not just a differentiator, but a system-seller for its new Xbox One console.Still, while the game is very good at what it does, it may have a more limited appeal than Microsoft is hoping.The first thing you notice when you boot up Titanfall is that it needs to connect to a data centre to work. No single player really means no single player. You can’t even customize your player character without first logging into a server.Once you get in, it quickly becomes apparent exactly what Titanfall is, namely the multiplayer from the multi-million selling Call of Duty games, only with giant robots and free-running instead of modern military combat.There are tweaks to the game that make it friendlier to new players, and changes to the gameplay allow more casual players not to be smacked around by the experts (quite as much), but at its heart it’s still Call of Duty With Robots.Which is fine. It’s the most popular part of the best-selling modern video-game series new and improved by the people who defined the format. That’s what many fans were hoping for.The problem is that while it’s very good it’s also very narrow.Titanfall is a very thin slice of what games can offer and isn’t even the big, blockbuster package that comes with the yearly installment of Call of Duty (which has a spectacle-based single player and, usually, a co-operative multiplayer mode as well).Which isn’t to say that Titanfall needs all that stuff. The game succeeds on its own merits in what it’s trying to do. But it’s hard to imagine buying an Xbox One over a PlayStation 4 just for the sake of Titanfall, especially if you were already leaning towards a PlayStation.It’s been a lukewarm year for Microsoft’s Xbox brand. When the new Xbox One was announced last spring, several aspects of the system — such as the inability to sell used games and frequent online check-ins for the system — were roundly reviled by consumers.As such, Microsoft quickly backtracked on some of those features before the system was released in late November.However, when the Xbox One hit shelves, it didn’t stack up especially well against Sony’s rival PlayStation 4 on a technical level despite a somewhat wider games library.The PlayStation 4 has reportedly outsold the Xbox One by as many as two million units (a third more total sales). As a plum exclusive coming just after launch, Titanfall is the game that’s supposed to stop Microsoft from getting entrenched in second place.That’s a lot of weight to put on a game that will really only appeal to a very specific (albeit large) group of people.The way I see it, Titanfall will sell a lot of units, and will help the Xbox One’s overall offerings, but the Xbox One will still likely be behind the PlayStation 4 for the foreseeable future.Hopefully, the game — which I want to re-iterate is very good at what it does — doesn’t get unfairly maligned for not propping up the system all by itself.

Titanfall is strictly coiled around the player. You couldn't excise even one piece without slackening it like a ruined kidnapper's rope. The serpentine level design, the liberating sense of movement, the flawless controls and yes, the enormous bipedal tanks dropping from the sky, are equally indispensable in this arresting shooter.

Given the studio's splintered status as a former Call of Duty custodian, Respawn Entertainment has made a multiplayer game fit for those who have spent years peering through the eyes of a speedy killing machine – a seasoned six against six in battles for land or a higher kill count. A history with rapid-fire aim and fleet-footed 3D movement is not essential here, but recommended.                    
  
  
  When you take on the role of a human pilot, movement in Titanfall offers an explosion of speed and possible trajectories, turning nearly every surface into a potential route of attack or retreat. The walls, alleys and windows of Titanfall's decaying urban battlegrounds become portals for jet-pack parkour, and hurling myself through a run-jump-wallrun-turn-jump-jump often tricked me into thinking Titanfall could stop there. Even if your head spins in the dense verticality, being lost lasts no more than a few seconds and maybe a double-jump. There's no stopping you or the game.But the pilots wouldn't feel quite so small and agile and powerful, in their own ways, if they didn't have some elephants stomping in their midst. The titans, massive war machines that come crackling and white-hot through the atmosphere at your behest, don't tower over the game's design as you might think. Summoning one of these mechanical beasts does not portend victory any more than donning a piece of armor does. It's better to think of a titan as a resource, traded for the time it takes to build one, or for defeating pilots and each map's dim-witted AI drones, each one knocking some precious seconds off construction time.Titans offer a kind of respite in the noisy flow of battle, shielding you from the lesser dangers outside – at least until the larger ones find you. Respawn has crafted a brilliant variety of animations, its monsters swallowing you whole and creating a vital continuity throughout every match. You don't transform into a titan and lose perspective; you're always the pilot in a crush-or-be-crushed world. The rising, falling, rising tension between the squirrelly knight and his lumbering suit of armor create some of Titanfall's most exhilarating clashes: Your titan scoops you into its hollow just as your screen starts flashing red with imminent death, bullets sparking off its cupped metal hand. Enemy flag in hand, you hitch a ride from a friendly robot and barge out of the encampment, missiles spiraling ahead. And finally – inevitably – you pound at the controls of a dying titan, triggering a volcanic ejection that leaves you high, alive and still in the game. The titans aren't cheap in Titanfall's time-based economy, but they're expendable and useful in their death throes, even turning into dirty nuclear bombs if you can make it far enough. That is, without an opposing titan ripping you out of the cockpit and tossing you aside; the game's funniest and most brutal first-person scene.Once you've boarded and killed enough of them, you'll realize titans aren't really that interesting when they fight only one another. The close calls and quick shifts in the game's overall flow from pilot to titan, and back again, are diminished in big-guy standoffs, if not nullified. That isn't to say titans lack strategic options, but Titanfall's magic is in transitions, not the bots banging their heads against one another. Capture the Flag is exciting again, while the nothing-but-robots 'Last Titan Standing' mode is an odd point of encroaching boredom.I found a lot to like, however, in the Strider, the most nimble of the three available titan models. While the more rounded Atlas mech and the burly Ogre can all extract benefit from the oversized chainguns, reflective energy shields and crippling electric smoke that make up just part of the titan armory, the Strider has extra dash capacity (which can be amped up even further if you're on a roll). This means quick bursts of lateral movement for dodging and counter-attacking, just like the good ol' Cyber Troopers Virtual-On days. If you're feeling braver, dashing is a quick way to get close for a block-rocking punch or the burning rub of a rocket salve. Smart audio cues and jolting audio design let you know when you're outnumbered (bad news), or when another combatant is about to come down on you (worse news). Recent Reviews Magus Walking Dead Season 2 South Park PvZ: Garden Warfare Jazzpunk Weapon Shop de Omasse Professor Layton: Azran Legacy Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 Thief ToukidenTitanfall's campaign mode plays out in audio more than anything, making it far too slight to lure in those who want to play by themselves. The firmly online campaign – there is no offline play in Titanfall – is a tour of matches and a good number of multiplayer maps, augmented with a few cutscenes and relevant dialogue to give events a bit more gravitas. A fight for generic control points, for instance, will be spun as fuel-gathering in the war between Titanfall's extrasolar factions, with the harshly South African commander commending or commiserating, depending on how you fare by the end. It's an inoffensive blend of multiplayer and the traditional story component – and it's nice that a loss doesn't halt your progress – but the effect is more like listening to a mediocre audiobook in the middle of war.War in Titanfall is often hinged on the performance of independent players. Unlike many class-based shooters, it's not outwardly concerned with cooperation, save for spontaneous teamwork like shooting pesky pilots off your fellow titans, or hacking AI-controlled turrets and robots to turn them to your side. By the way, if you were wondering where Titanfall fits in the spectrum between macho and nerdy, let me tell you that hacking here is literally stabbing a computer with your cyber-knife until it relents.The lack of a delineated support role hurts Titanfall, even knowing it's a more measured and aggressive game than something like Battlefield. The classes you can build from the game's locker of shotguns, rifles, auto-targeting pistols and scopes don't feel limited, per se, but most options are a shade of assault. If you're someone who prefers supporting and healing tasks, I think it would be harder for you to find a comfortable place in a Titanfall team. The game does make up for the lack of a hang-back role in small but clever ways. A frantic escape sequence concludes most matches, with the losers having one more chance at upliftment if they can reach a departing ship on time and alive. Pilots have a host of unique abilities, including a burst of speed, temporary invisibility or even faster feats of parkour. A stack of sacrificial ""burn cards"" provide helpful tweaks upon death, amping up your weapons, extending your ability to sprint, or cutting down titan construction time. All of these have the potential to destabilize a match, provided you can hold your own long enough to act.Titanfall's systems of scoring and progression aren't as overbearing as I thought they would be – again, there's that Call of Duty heritage. The game doles out weapon enhancements and titan configurations at an addictive pace, and eventually opens up choices that come with sacrifices. I still haven't made up my mind about the titan machine gun that shoots faster the longer you hold down the trigger. That gives it more potential punch, but every time you let go to reclaim your finger, you're back to a weaker weapon. That's bad news in some of the more heavily segmented maps, where titans tend to bunch up into deadly bottlenecks and single-file death marches. I'm still looking at you, Last Titan Standing.When it's not all a clash of the you-know-whats, when there's a volatile mix of scampering boots and earth-rattling bipeds on the battlefield, Titanfall truly excels. It subsists on imbalance and the race to bear big arms first. It feeds on the fallout that results when equality means the other guy gets a robot too. Titanfall isn't tuned to perfection for everyone yet, but it starts as a smart, swift and startling movement in well-traveled space. Overall State of Service: GoodIn its first month of availability, Titanfall encountered no debilitating or pervasive problems, and the quality of its online play was consistent. Full report here. What's State of Service? This review is based on Xbox One version of Titanfall, played at an Electronic Arts review event on live servers. The Xbox One retail version was also tested on live servers.

Sony has also confirmed that another content update on April 17 will see the launch of the Metal Gear Solid Online Beta trial. Nice.The latest Warhawk expansion, Operation Broken Mirror is also expected on the store any time now. Let's hope than can get more updates on there from now on.And if you're away from the PS3, see the new store in actionhere.Courtesy of CVG.Apr 15, 2008Get the best gaming deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable gaming news and more!GamesRadar+ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

90	The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Titanfall’s mechs can be devastating, but also surprisingly vulnerable. They can be easily destroyed when tag-teamed by opponent Titans, or if a Pilot is particularly reckless and doesn’t play defence. Unlike the human combatants, the mechs don’t regenerate health, which is why it’s wise for them to take cover whenever their shields go down.Electronic ArtsFor anyone holding out for a true next-generation first-person shooter, the wait is over: Titanfall has arrived and it makes good on its promise to advance the genre. That's good news, but also bad.Electronic Arts' sure-to-be blockbuster sci-fi game is an immensely enjoyable and exquisitely crafted shoot-em-up that puts players in the seat of giant warring mech robots. It grafts Call of Duty quality play on a distant future setting, which should be no surprise given that the makers of this game are the original inventors of that mammoth franchise.Yet Titanfall is also a worrisome product that delivers only a fraction of what competing games – including Call of Duty – do, for the same price tag. That sets a worrying precedent where gamers are set to get less game for the same money. As the next generation of consoles takes root, this is both a commercial and an artistic concern.Story continues below advertisementTitanfall takes place in a future where humanity has rocketed to the stars, which, through a short intro video, is about all the back story there is. A quick tutorial on how to run, jump and drive Titans and we're launched straight into online multiplayer action. If you haven't heard, there's no single-player campaign here. More on that in a minute.At its core, Titanfall is essentially three multiplayer games in one. On the first front, it's very much like most FPS titles out there. Players control Pilots, or human soldiers who are upgradeable through the experience points they earn in matches. New weapons, attachments and special abilities are unlocked through level progression, with each carrying its own upsides and downsides. Sniper rifles are great for long-range attacks, for example, but not so much up close, where submachine guns are better.On top of that, the Pilots are also especially adept at jumping and climbing. They can run along walls for short periods and their jet-packs allow them to leap atop tall buildings. Titanfall's addition of a vertical element to firefights literally introduces a new dimension to the genre. Stopping here might have been enough to create an exciting new type of FPS, but nope, the developers went further.Every player eventually gets access to the giant Titan robots, which come booming out of the sky as they're dropped from orbit. Once inside, players have a bevy of heavy armaments at their disposal, with the powerful machines handling like something between a tank and a jet fighter. Like the Pilots themselves, the mechs can be upgraded through levelling up. The entire goal of the game is to basically get into these things as much as possible so that you can unleash carnage on your enemies.Respawn has done an excellent job at balancing these three aspects. While it would seem like the Pilots would be terribly outmatched by the gigantic Titans, their parkour-like abilities give them a fighting chance at scurrying into cover, then they can retaliate with their own heavy weapons. Either that, or they can jump on the mech's head and shoot out its circuitry up close.The mechs, meanwhile, can be devastating, but also surprisingly vulnerable. They can be easily destroyed when tag-teamed by opponent Titans, or if a Pilot is particularly reckless and doesn't play defence. Unlike the human combatants, the mechs don't regenerate health, which is why it's wise for them to take cover whenever their shields go down.Thrown into this mix is a healthy dose of artificial intelligence. While most match types limit teams to six human participants each, up to 48 combatants can often take part. These can be dumb cannon-fodder grunts with bad aim, more highly skilled Specter drones or AI Titans themselves. Regardless of what kind of game mode is being played, the battlefields are inevitably heavily populated with opponents to dispatch and allies to provide help.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementThe resultant wars are expansive and thrilling, with several different levels of action – both figuratively and literally – happening at any given time. Infantry troops can be fighting it out in the tunnels beneath a building while Titans face off around it. Pilots can be on the roof, meanwhile, trying to take everyone out. There's always something going on, and it makes the battles frenetic, fast-paced and exhilarating.Titanfall's excellent sound design also warrants special mention. From the clank-clank-clank of the mechs stomping about to the pulsing explosiveness of shoulder rockets launching, just about every audio effect contributes weight to the experience. I found myself sticking with certain weapons just because of the way they sounded (I particularly like the metallic whirring of the Titan chain gun). It's a game best played with the volume cranked way up.The developers have also taken great strides toward creating an FPS that is appealing to hard-core fans of the genre and newcomers alike. The ratio of AI to human players, as well as the generally large maps on which the action takes place, is tuned to give newbies a chance at feeling like they can contribute. They can spend the entire game scoring points by taking out grunts and Specters while more skilled players can concentrate on going after more dangerous prey, like each other. If newbies can manage to stay away from the pros, they may just enjoy this game.If there's a downside to the combat, it's that it's too heavily skewed toward getting Titans. While fighting on foot is okay, it pales in comparison to driving the fearsome mechs, which is what the game is all about, after all. Pilots can decrease the amount of time until their next Titan becomes available by taking out other players or AI bots, a goal that usually takes over the game. As a result, infantry combat is more of a grind to get through on the way to getting a Titan than it is a fun pursuit on its own.Titanfall's bigger problem is that, beyond its fundamental gameplay and standard multiplayer modes, such as team death match, domination and Last Titan Standing (Titans only, no respawning), there really isn't much depth to it. As mentioned above, there's no single-player mode and therefore no real fiction or story to the game.A multiplayer campaign mode takes a stab at adding some narrative in the form of pre-match audio briefings, but the subsequent battles are just repeats of the same multiplayer modes. There really wouldn't be much reason to play these missions if they didn't unlock additional chassis for your Titan.Story continues below advertisementRespawn's reasons for foregoing a single-player mode are somewhat understandable. The developers wanted to focus their energies on creating a bang-up multiplayer experience, and many FPS players bypass games' campaign modes entirely anyway, but it really is too bad in this case. I would have liked a better explanation of how these giant robots came to be and why they're currently fighting each other. Rumours of a single-player campaign coming along as extra downloadable content are swirling, but that's something that should have been included from the start in a game with such promising fiction behind it.It's not just a single-player campaign that's missing, it's the ability to play the game alone or offline in any way. If something happens to your internet connection or to EA's servers, Titanfall is simply unplayable, which seems inexcusable for a game with so much functioning AI.And let's remember, there is a non-zero chance of server failure: Early purchasers of the game should be aware that EA has on several occasions experienced server issues with new titles at launch (SimCity and Battlefield 4 come to mind). I reviewed Titanfall through a downloadable Xbox One code provided by Electronic Arts. Servers for the game were not up and running until late Saturday evening, with intermittent connection problems occurring on Sunday.The total lack of single-player capability is at odds with most other FPS games. If the likes of Call of Duty or Halo can provide both single- and multiplayer modes for the same price tag, it doesn't seem right that Titanfall can't. While Respawn and EA are cutting down on the price of development by foregoing single-player, those savings aren't being passed on to gamers, which is the concerning part of the game. At the very least, including an offline AI bot mode would seem to be a no-brainer, but it's not here for whatever reason.So, while Titanfall delivers amazing next-generation action, its next-generation business plan isn't nearly as impressive.

91	"130.4m sharesIt’s the game that could make or break the Xbox One, but does this new FPS have what it takes to be the next gen’s biggest shooter?It’s not just the Xbox One that needs Titanfall to be a success. We’re now a good few months into the next generation of consoles and so far there have been very few games to justify spending hundreds on new hardware. Not only have there been few technical innovations but also very few new gameplay ideas. Titanfall is one of the first games to promise both and its success or failure will have a profound effect on the future of the new consoles…Of course the one element of Titanfall that has already been a success is its marketing campaign, which is the primarily reason the stakes have been raised to this level. Luckily Titanfall is an excellent game, but that praise does come with some qualifications – and it’s important you understand what they are before you go in expecting the game to be something it is not.As we’ve noted all along Titanfall is not a complicated sell. Although we use the term ‘Call Of Duty with robots’ partly in jest that does go a long way towards summing up its appeal. Especially if you add ‘and Mirror’s Edge parkour‘ to the description.Developer Respawn was founded by two of the co-creators of Call Of Duty (although one left almost immediately) and is staffed by many ex-Infinity Ward veterans. It’s therefore no surprise to find that as a close quarters first person shooter Titanfall doesn’t put a foot wrong. It’s also no surprise to find it handles very similarly to Call Of Duty, with the same silky smooth movement and as precise as aiming as the Xbox One controller will allow (in fact more so, given that Respawn got Microsoft to adjust the sensitivity just for them).But the on-foot combat is not limited to simply running around on the ground, as all the human characters (referred to as Pilots) are equipped with a short-range jetpack. It doesn’t exactly make you the Rocketeer though, and it’s really just an excuse to explain why you can double jump and wall run like Prince of Persia.Using these new parkour powers takes a lot of practise, and at first it seems all but impossible to do anything but jump onto and into buildings. But as you learn the layout of the maps you realise that what at first seemed to be randomly placed billboards or debris are actually carefully positioned to allow you to traverse the entire map almost without touching the ground.Your weaponry as a Pilot is relatively mundane by shooter standards, especially as this is meant to be a sci-fi game, with the much talked about smart pistol (which can automatically lock on to nearby targets) being one of the few deviations from the norm. There are some interesting gadgets to kit yourself out with though, including an upgradeable cloaking device and a very handy x-ray radar pulse.There are also single use ‘burn cards’, which confer one shot bonuses like extra speed, over-powered weapons, and score multipliers. You have to choose them before a match and then get to use one whenever you die – up to a total of three per match.The weapons for the robot exoskeletons (the eponymous titans) are a little more out there, including what is essentially a lightning gun, but the game goes to great lengths not to bombard players with any more sci-fi hardware than it has too. There are a few reasons for this, including the current dominance of modern day military shooters, but the main one is making sure that nobody starts to think that jumping in and out of 20 foot robots is silly. It is, if you stop to think about it, but you never will because being a 20 foot robot is made to feel just as awesome as it should.While the parkour antics take some getting used to controlling a titan is extremely easy. The controls are almost identical to being on foot, except you’re a little slower (more or less so depending on which of the three models you’re piloting) and you can only dash instead of jump. Otherwise though you’re almost as manoeuvrable as a Pilot, except you can now step on other people and you’re wielding guns the size of smart cars.But controlling a titan has the opposite learning curve to being a Pilot: while the controls are instantly accessible the tactical implications of being a big giant robot are less clear. At first of course you just march into battle assuming you’re invincible but although you can certainly survive several hits you still won’t last long under a concentrated attack – especially as every Pilot is armed with their own anti-titan weapon.We played the game over a period of two days (so roughly 14 hours of playtime) and it was fascinating to see the different tactics that evolved over that time. Some took to sniping from afar, while others largely gave up with the titan and just kept it in guard or follow mode as they continued on foot. Our preference though was for close quarters combat.In fact we can pinpoint the exact moment we fell in love with Titanfall: it was on the Lagoon map in a standard Attrition match (basically Team Deathmatch). We’d opted for the all-rounder Atlas chassis, with a tank-like 40mm cannon, a smoke generator, and heat-seeking missiles. We started by taking out one already damaged Stryder (the fast-but-weak chassis) but our victory seemed destined to be short-lived as a Pilot jumped on-board and started to ‘rodeo’ our titan.This is always the most humiliating way to go out, so we turned on the smoke generator (which is specifically designed to also damage Pilots), got outside to shotgun him off the titan’s back, jumped back in and then used the gas as cover to batter another titan that had strayed too close – ripping the Pilot out from inside of it. This then triggered a time-limited period of extra damage where we got to beat up on two more titans before ejecting and making use of a burn card that added extra damage to a death knell explosion that took out the two new interlopers.It’s probably a good job that that the mic on the headphones we were using didn’t work properly, because we’re pretty sure we roared (well, probably eeked) in triumph at that point. And if we’d had a can of engine oil to hand we would’ve have splashed it on our face as a sign of our robot virility.That was the best killing streak we had in a titan but the whole game is filled with unrepeatable moments like that, from taking a jetpack shortcut to chase down an opponent in Capture the Flag to the obsession everyone at the review event got with trying to destroy the opposing dropship with a titan drop (allegedly it can be done, but no one actually managed it).In terms of gameplay Titanfall absolutely lives up to the hype, but there are several problems with the package as a whole – many of them seemingly due to having to meet this month’s release date. Although there’s a generous 15 maps included, all of a very high quality, there’s only five game modes: Attrition (aka Team Deathmatch), Hardpoint (aka Conquest), Capture the Flag, Last Titan Standing (a multi-round knockout match), and Pilot Hunter (just what it sounds like). Not only is that not much but none of them are very imaginative considering the differences between this and other shooters.There’s a lack of customisation too, with no cosmetic options at all beyond choosing your gender. The graphics are also largely unimpressive and there are frequent, if minor, problems with object pop-in and frame rate judder. At the review event we were playing the game on what was alleged to be the real Microsoft-run servers, but with only around 50 people in the room that was no kind of test for what the game will be like at launch. But for the record we had four separate disconnection errors during the two days, with most of the people around us seeming to suffer a similar number.The problems with slowdown are only occasional but they are noticeable, and although the lack of destructible scenery has already been put down to a conscious choice there’s a real lack of interactivity in the maps. For example, the much talked about monsters that inhabit some levels are merely background details and only ever attack the computer-controlled characters – and only then rarely.Speaking of which the various grunts and Terminator-like robots that move around the maps really don’t do very much at all. You stand almost no danger of being killed by them and apart from offering up a few free experience points if you shoot them they serve no purpose other than to make the level look a little busier.Titanfall’s biggest misfire though is the campaign multiplayer, which is almost laughably awful. Before release Respawn kept talking about it as being the experience of a single-player story mode but with multiplayer gameplay. But there are no extra set pieces and only a few seconds of cut scene before a stage, which means that the entire storytelling effort relies on a bunch of clichéd characters jabbering on the radio.In fact you can very easily simulate Titanfall’s campaign multiplayer in any online shooter you like. Just get some family or friends to argue very loudly about something you have no interest in while you’re trying to play and bingo: instant campaign multiplayer. It’s not even as if winning or losing has any effect on the story, with the dialogue adapting slightly but the outcome never altering.It’s farcically poor and although the campaign multiplayer is only a minor part of the game it is a terrible bit of universe building. Together with the generic art design Titanfall has the least interesting backstory for any new game we can remember, with two sides fighting over vaguely implied goals (there’s a milita and an evil corporation that makes robots) that ends merely in a bit of sequel begging.But none of the problems with Titanfall are serious ones, and if a sequel is what Respawn want then we’d be more than happy to encourage it. Many will argue that this is still not a major step forward for the genre, and that Titanfall is still not a game that actually needs a next gen console. And even though the Xbox 360 version still hasn’t been seen in public they’re probably right.
But the only thing that really matters is whether Titanfall is a good game or not. It’s most definitely that, and the most fun we’ve had with online multiplayer in years.In Short: It could do with a few more ancillary options, and a more interesting backstory, but in terms of online gameplay Titanfall is now the game to beat this gen.Pros: Perfectly balanced gameplay, pin sharp controls, and a huge range of emergent tactics. 15 great maps and the titans themselves are excellent – as are the Pilots and their parkour skills.Cons: Campaign multiplayer is a farcical waste of time. Plenty of maps, but the lack of game modes and customisation points to a hurried development schedule. Some minor graphical issues.Score: 9/10Formats: Xbox One (reviewed), Xbox 360, and PC

							Final verdict from live servers.						
																			Respawn's slick multiplayer shooter is the shot in the arm the genre needs.									
																	
															By Dan Whitehead
									
							Published 17/03/2014

															Version tested Xbox One

Talk about pressure. The first game from a studio headed up by the co-creator of Call of Duty. The first big third-party exclusive of the new console generation. The game that arrives pre-anointed with 80 awards from journalists dazzled by trade show demonstrations. And all in a stifled genre crying out for a breath of fresh air. Yes, there's a lot riding on Titanfall's shoulders. Good thing those shoulders are made of reinforced steel.The twist, of course, is that you're playing as an unusually athletic pilot on the space frontier, able to double-jump up to two stories high thanks to your jet-boosted belt and run along walls, mocking gravity as you go. You also have access to a Titan, a hulking armoured robot that turns you from vulnerable foot soldier to towering battlefield menace.Peel apart Titanfall's suite of headline features and there's nothing technically new here. Mech suits and parkour are hardly unknown quantities in gaming, but what Respawn has done is to combine these elements - along with a generous spread of other intriguing concepts - with a simple, confident control scheme and a punchy style that not only revitalises these potentially tired ideas, but the first-person shooter genre itself.Pacific Rim and District 9 have both been on repeat play in the Respawn offices, if the game's aesthetic stylings are anything to go by.That freshness doesn't extend to the basic narrative set-up, sadly. Framed as a conflict between the ruthless military forces of the IMC and the ragged guerrilla upstarts of the Militia, the thin backdrop for Titanfall's action is as clichéd as it is shallow. There's a campaign mode of sorts, in which you play through nine matches as both factions, but it's an odd half-measure. The storyline is dull and obvious, with a turncoat defecting from the IMC to lead the Militia - and bolting audio cut-scenes onto otherwise normal multiplayer matches is a poor way of telling a story that's none too interesting to begin with.""We're just not used to first-person shooters that play like this."" Better to head for the Classic playlists, where you'll find the real Titanfall experience, and it's surprisingly good. Surprising not because anyone really expected it to be bad, but because we're just not used to first-person shooters that play like this. Where the genre-topping likes of COD and Battlefield have doubled-down on their hardcore player base, Titanfall is a much more welcoming affair. The pace is a little less manic, newcomers will be able to survive for more than 30 seconds without being killed, and the game constantly goes out of its way to make sure that, win or lose, everyone gets to have fun.This is most clearly illustrated in the Titans themselves. No matter how badly you play, you'll get to jump into a Titan eventually. It takes roughly three minutes for your Titan to be ready - summoned into battle with a satisfying thwump as it drops from the sky - but that build time can be sped up by good combat performance. Play well and you get the cool toys sooner, but even if you never even hit another player, you'll still get your time in the driver's seat.In a way it feels wrong: an egalitarian approach that flies in the face of the unforgiving elitism that drives most shooters. Respawn has cannily designed the game, though, so that things which should utterly unbalance the match and remove skill from the equation actually do the opposite. Getting into a Titan is fun - literally, since the various animations for mounting up from different angles all look incredibly cool - but it's no guarantee of domination.Titans are made to battle other Titans, and while they can crush players on foot (again, literally), the agility of the human characters makes that harder than it sounds. Add in a special inventory slot just for powerful Anti-Titan weapons, the ability to ""rodeo"" on Titans and demolish them with close-quarters fire and the verticality of maps which allow pilots to hop around like fleas to find better vantage points, and you've got a seemingly chaotic system that actually works like clockwork. Returning to existing shooters after time spent on Titanfall can be jarring - they feel leaden and limiting, and you'll yearn to be able to leap to rooftops and stomp down streets once more.Titanfall was originally played for review at a two-day event in London, hosted by EA. Eurogamer paid travel and accommodation expenses. We then played the game at home under normal conditions after both the North American and European launches.If you master the wall-running early on, you'll have a definite advantage - it opens up the maps to whole new areas of tactical play.You can even have the best of both worlds thanks to the Titan AI mode. Once it has dropped, you don't have to control the Titan yourself; set it to Guard or Follow mode and it'll act autonomously, gaining kills and XP on your behalf. You quickly learn that the secret to success is to swap between the two frequently, essentially operating as two distinct units at the same time.Related to this are the AI bots which round out the matches. With only 12 players per match, it's tempting to see this as a way of making up the numbers, but these drone fighters prove to be more than that. They're a third tier of combatant, mostly dim, unlikely to do any real damage and unable to swing the direction of a match, but they act as battlefield markers that skilled pilots can quickly read. Follow the drones and you'll find the heat of the action. That they also offer small scoring opportunities and reasonably useful back-up is just gravy. Crucially, they offer easy cannon fodder for new players, breaking that dispiriting cycle of respawn-death-respawn that comes from player-only deathmatches. Every player can feel like they're doing something useful, something fun, even if they're actually getting creamed.It's a sharp change of direction for developers who previously skewed the genre by introducing Modern Warfare's controversial Perk and Killstreak systems - and the equivalent here marks the difference neatly. Burn Cards aren't earned for just killing other players, but handed out generously for meeting all sorts of criteria in almost 1000 ongoing ambient stats challenges. You can equip up to three cards per match, and opt to use one before a round starts. You may get a more powerful weapon, a souped-up ability or a reduction in the countdown for your Titan. What matters is that each card is a single-use item and is lost at the end of the match or when you die, whichever comes first. In other words, they offer a useful advantage, but only for a short time. The days of the best players getting permanent boosts that keep them at the top are gone.After a week of playing Titanfall on populated retail servers, we can report that the game hasn't suffered any grievous problems or technical setbacks. That is, of course, excepting the hiccups that affected both Xbox Live and Origin at the game's US launch. While it's unfair to hold such admittedly brief outages against Respawn's game, they do illustrate the potential pitfalls of a game that relies so heavily on an internet connection. Since Titanfall uses cloud computing to run some of its game code, rather than just to connect players, if these gateway services go down then the whole game becomes locked off.As such, there's seemingly no way for the game to offer local offline play in the future and even the tutorial is unavailable if servers are unresponsive. That's not something we can quantify or predict in terms of Titanfall's score, but it's certainly something that bears consideration. At some point in the future, the cloud servers could be taken down or reassigned elsewhere and Titanfall will cease to be playable.That somewhat troubling horizon aside, Titanfall's online play is, based on a traffic-heavy first week, fine. The game still suffers from chunky frame rates when Titans battle up close, and you'll still get those rare moments of infuriating lag where the replay shows an enemy killing you with a shot that seemingly passed through the scenery to get you, but server hiccups are rare. Only twice in over 10 hours of play has the message ""Reconnecting to server"" appeared. At these points the entire screen blurs, even as the match continues, but the issue never took more than a few seconds to resolve.Even with the cloud doing support work for the Xbox One's processor, Titanfall plays as well as a steady and reliable last-gen title. Not really noticeable progress from a player's perspective, then, but a relatively painless launch and a game that hasn't suffered any of the grim problems that Battlefield and SimCity players faced last year.
Titanfall's action is as muscular and thrilling as you'd expect, given Respawn's pedigree, but it's this new attitude towards player balance that makes it stand out. Skill is still rewarded, but lack of skill isn't so harshly punished. Witness the adrenalin rush of ejecting from a doomed Titan and soaring into the air for a bird's eye view of the battlefield that allows you to drop back into action with a tactical advantage. Better still is the idea of evacuation, a stroke of match design genius that ends every round not with a hard cut to the leaderboard but with an extra-time, no-respawns scramble to an exit point.Those on the losing team have to reach a dropship before it escapes; the winners must stop them. It's a small and simple tweak, but one that offers just enough of a second chance, and a team-based narrative, to take the personal sting out of defeat. Many's the time you'll lose a match but emerge feeling victorious because you made it to the dropship unscathed. It's this willingness to make even losing fun that sets Titanfall apart, and suggests a more inclusive future for the FPS genre.You need to complete both the IMC and Militia campaigns in order to unlock all three Titan chassis for custom loadouts.Not all of the concessions to more inviting play are as well considered, however. The auto-targetting Smart Pistol is another fine example of how an apparently game-breaking idea can actually enhance the experience. It's powerful, but never too powerful, and as you unlock more weapons you'll naturally gravitate away from it. It's just a shame that the weapons that follow are never as interesting or imaginative. Assault rifles, SMGs, shotguns and sniper rifles - there are few surprises, and even the anti-Titan weapons are sensibly effective rather than memorable and exciting. It's all disappointingly vanilla-flavoured after the Smart Pistol, which stands alone in the arsenal as a weapon with unique gameplay intent behind it. It's as if the team behind Insomniac's inventively armed Resistance series popped in, designed one weapon, then left.Weaponry is one area where it feels like Respawn wasn't quite ready to let go of its Infinity Ward heritage; the other is the game modes themselves. Despite gameplay systems that shake up FPS tropes in enjoyable new ways, the fact that you're limited to five overly familiar play styles can't help but eat away at Titanfall's long-term appeal. Hardpoint Domination and Attrition are the main two, the only ones used in the so-called campaign matches, and they're predictable enough. Attrition is Team Deathmatch by any other name, while Hardpoint Domination is a base capture mode with three holding points per map. The latter shows Titanfall at its strongest, demanding solid offensive and defensive play across the whole of the map.There's also Pilot Hunter, in which points are only scored by killing pilots not demolishing Titans, and the flipside to that is Last Titan Standing, in which every player starts in a Titan but there are no respawns. As the name suggests, the first team to run out of Titans loses. Neither mode is particularly satisfying, though Last Titan Standing has a certain pugnacious charm as it often descends into short, brutal slugfests. The trouble is that Titanfall's appeal comes from the way its ideas are intertwined, so modes that force players to focus on one aspect over another are inevitably weakened. That only leaves Capture The Flag, a standard inclusion that isn't elevated enough by Titanfall's best ideas. CTF matches too often end in stalemate, and while the maps offer some interesting routes for parkour escapes, it's the least satisfying way to play.While these rather tired old modes are initially refreshed by Titanfall's reconstructed approach to FPS pacing and balance, it's not quite enough to sustain it. There's a plateau somewhere around level 25 where the rate of unlocks slows down, the matches start to fall into repetition, and the accumulation of XP, generous as it is, begins to feel the drag of the grind. What's missing is a mode that could only be done in this game - something that redefines the shooter on Titanfall's terms.Map design is solid, if short on memorable features. Mostly, it's the same balancing act that impresses: the way that a map takes on completely different aspects from a Titan cockpit than it does from the ground. It's a different style of map-making from that practised on the Modern Warfare series, where constant, restless and relentless motion is the driving force. Titanfall maps have more corners and dead ends, more strange angles, than the frictionless ice rinks of COD.One of the most useful Burn Cards disguises you as an AI grunt - it's amazing how many players will ignore you.The naming conventions, at least, hark back to Respawn's past with curt, even blunt, one-word titles such as Lagoon, Fracture and Corporate the norm. The latter is one of the best examples of how the game juggles tense, intimate, interior conflicts with larger-scale, Titan-fuelled bombast. Set in a robotics factory, the map has wide, sweeping exteriors, an enclosed courtyard, tangles of interior rooms offering multiple vantage points and - crucially - lots of rooftops and elevated walkways. The flow is different to COD's as you segue between slower-paced, pounding Titan encounters and fast and nasty quick-draw scenarios, before taking to the higher ground to survey the situation and maybe pull off some long-distance kills.Navigating these spaces is a constant pleasure, as you piggyback on enemy Titans and spring off again as they explode, using them as stepping stones to otherwise unreachable spots. It's not just that the game lets you do this sort of thing, but that it feels so effortless in execution. It's like playing first-person Crackdown - a game where you almost can't help but do cool stuff.""Respawn has shaken up the FPS just as surely as Infinity Ward did with Modern Warfare, and any one of Titanfall's ideas would be a fine starting point for a new era in shooter design."" Is Titanfall the next-gen showcase we've been waiting for? In pure gameplay terms, it's hard to argue otherwise. Respawn has shaken up the FPS just as surely as Infinity Ward did with the original Modern Warfare, and any one of Titanfall's ideas would be a fine starting point for a new era in shooter design. That it boasts several such ideas speaks highly of the studio's desire to break the repetition that has taken root in recent years.Structurally is where Titanfall shows its limitations, and the reliance on the same old standard match types feels like a concession to the restrictions the rest of the game kicks against. Technically, too, it's not quite the polished gem some may be expecting. Textures don't always impress when wall-running brings you close to them, and the frame rate can still chug when the action gets intense. There's noticeable screen tearing and load times can be a chore. Character models and animations don't always stand up to much scrutiny either. None of this is particularly harmful, but it does take the shine off what many will expect to be a pristine, console-justifying experience.It all comes back to the gameplay though, and it's here that Titanfall stamps its identity most firmly. It's no secret that first-person shooters are in a comfortable rut, and Titanfall shakes things up perfectly - not just in terms of design, but more crucially, in how these games relate to their audience. With almost no blood and only mild swearing, the game's accessible nature is a door thrown open to everyone who has steered clear of the bullish, hyper-macho military shooters that have come to dominate the scene.In fact, Titanfall gets so much right that it's easy to start taking it for granted, as game-changing ideas become second nature so quickly and so easily. Titanfall's moment-to-moment gameplay is fantastic, but it's the things that are missing that hold it back from being truly excellent. The technical rough edges are disappointing, but not distractingly so. Harder to ignore are the limited and repetitive game modes and a general lack of options for refining the matchmaking.There are no private lobbies, nor any opportunity to vote on the next map or mode. Getting into a game is slick and easy, but the downside is that you end up taking what you're given. Matchmaking, too, needs work: lobbies tend to go out of balance during prolonged sessions as players drop out and teams are repopulated in odd ways. It's not unusual to see one team with multiple high-level players pitted against a team whose highest ranked player is in the mid-teens. The good news is that Respawn is aware of, and reacting to, these issues. With the right updates and additions, Titanfall could easily become the shooter of choice for the new console generation. For now, it's muscular and entertaining, but limited in scope.In its current form, then, Titanfall is perhaps more of a step forward for shooters than a giant leap. But that still represents the most positive momentum seen in the genre for at least five years. Quite simply, if you feel like you're in danger of falling out of love with multiplayer shooters, Titanfall is the game to win you back.
This review was originally published as a launch review on 10th March, meaning we played the game in controlled conditions and withheld a score until we could test it on live servers. After playing during both the North American and European launches, we added live game impressions, tweaked the conclusion and added a score on 17th March.

93	Respawn's Xbox exclusive shooter unleashes the mechs and a campaign multiplayer mode - and we put it to the testEven in this era of high def hyperbole, Titanfall has an awful lot to live up to.Microsoft are hoping Respawn’s Xbox exclusive shooter will be the sort of dead cert system seller that'll bridge the sales gap that has emerged between the Xbox One and rival Sony's PlayStation 4. So much so, in fact, they're subsidising a new cut-price console bundle which comes with a copy of the game when it's released on Friday.We’ve been here before, of course: popular history has it that Halo, another sci-fi themed first person shooter, helped establish the original Xbox as a contender in a console landscape dominated by the PlayStation. The difference, though, is that Titanfall is a multiplayer only game.In many respects this shouldn’t matter. Anecdotal evidence has long pointed to Battlefield and Call of Duty players treating those titles’ story modes as optional extras: the underwhelming undercard to multiplayer’s main event; mere distractions to the demands of deathmatches.And yet clearly there are also many FPS fans for whom it does matter, and who view such content as a crucial purchasing decision.Titanfall’s concession to them is its ‘campaign multiplayer’ mode, a fundamentally flawed attempt to provide the best of both worlds by loosely linking matches with an overarching narrative that remains largely unaffected by anything either team does during them.Sure there are some scripted events and a ceaseless stream of NPC chatter that you’ll struggle even to hear mid-combat, let alone make sense of, but for the main campaign multiplayer feels much like regular multiplayer only with fewer gameplay options.To compound further the sheer futility of this back-of-the-box-ticking exercise, players have to complete both sides of the campaign to unlock a full compliment of Titans for use in other modes.It’s a rare - albeit surprisingly significant - misstep in what otherwise often resembles a masterclass in multiplayer shooter design.As many of the 2 million-plus players who took part in the recent Xbox One and PC open beta will surely testify, the impeccable balance struck between Titanfall’s central combat trinity of massive mechs, parkouring pilots and AI-controlled grunts makes for one of the most multi-faceted FPS experiences in recent memory .Respawn’s most admirable achievement, though, is that it’s also brilliant fun to play. Mindful of the fresh-faced FNGs the game is sure to attract, Titanfall is beautifully accessible - joyously so for anyone who’s been scarred by COD’s merciless killing fields - yet still boasts enough depth to cater for combat veterans.It’s an approach that can be felt everywhere from the one-use booster cards that can give you a temporary but tangible edge in encounters to the post-match Epilogue that allows losing players to save face (and XP) by escaping the battlefield.The apogee of this aesthetic is surely the auto-targeting Smart Pistol, a wonderfully empowering piece of tech that allows newcomers to feel like headshotting heroes without ever threatening the overall integrity of the game.Perversely for a game predicated on the presence of multi-story mechs, less is very much more. The small but perfectly tuned arsenal of weapons, upgrades and loadouts, for example, offers a smaller number of meaningful choices rather than overwhelming players with options.And even though Titanfall features only five gametypes - Attrition (deathmatch, essentially), Hardpoint Domination, Capture the Flag, Pilot Hunter (in which only player kills count), and the round-based Last Titan Standing - each feels fresh due to the redesigned battlefield dynamics.The 15 or so maps on offer impress more for their layouts rather than their looks, the best becoming colossal climbing frames that you clamber around and over with practiced ease.Verticality - so often clumsily handled by shooters, if at all - becomes an essential tactic, and it’s the sense of scale coupled with an unprecedented freedom of movement that marks out Titanfall as a truly next gen experience.Whether all that’s enough to convert single players to the cause or convince floating gamers to splash out on a new console remains to be seen.On the one hand, criticising Titanfall for ‘just’ being a multiplayer shooter feels as fatuous as writing off a Ferrari for ‘just’ being a car, and yet it remains the giant robot in the room.One thing’s for sure, though: Respawn have certainly gone above and beyond the Call of Duty to reinvent the genre for a new generation.Titanfall is released on Xbox One and PC on March 14th. An Xbox 360 version will follow on March 28th. 	Science

96	     Respawn Entertainment has confirmed that Titanfall will launch at a native resolution of 792p on Xbox One.  Lead Engineer Richard Baker confirmed the news that will probably lead to more “Xbox One is doomed” articles popping up because the game isn’t at 1080p.  However, Baker did note that Respawn is looking into upping the resolution in the future.“We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,” Baker revealed to Eurogamer. “One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we’re going to use, so we’re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don’t have to have this larger render target.“We’re going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimise… we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship.”Resolution has become an argument between Xbox One and PS4 fanboys.  Numerous Third-Party games on Xbox One have been observed running at a lower resolution than their PS4 counter-parts.  Still, the game’s look good on both platforms despite a different in native resolution.Titanfall is out tomorrow, March 11 on Xbox One and PC.  The Xbox 360 version is out March 25.

98	"Titanfall has been at the center of a seemingly endless string of controversies surrounding new games on both the Xbox One and PS4. Though both systems consistently miss the target of 1080p/60fps everyone thought would be ""standard"" with this new generation, 
 
Microsoft's
 Xbox One appears to be off that metric more than its competitor.It's been confirmed that Titanfall will launch in 792p, but it likely won't stay that way. Lead engineer Richard Baker spoke to Eurogamer about the probability of patching the game into a higher

We're likely to increase resolution after we ship.""
It's understandable that Respawn wouldn't want to either A) pump out the game at a high resolution that caused it to run poorly or B) delay the game to fix the resolution issues alone.For as much as critics love to use resolution as a point of contention when it comes to new games, it's not all that obvious when playing, particularly on consoles. While the difference between 720p and 1080p is quite apparent on a computer monitor, the same cannot be said from a TV sitting ten feet away from the player. This is especially the case with a game full of as much non-stop action and constant movement as Titanfall. In that case, FPS is the more of an important metric.Still, it's great to hear this is being worked on and would be able to be fixed in a later patch. This has already happened with the PS4, as games like Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty have had patches to increase their resolution to around 1080p.It goes to show that consoles are going to forever be a work in progress as developers learn how to get the most out of them. As is always the case, what graphical struggles may occur at the beginning of a console's lifespan will feel lightyears away by the end. I have no doubt that games will continue to look better and better as time goes on, with higher resolutions to match.Follow me on Twitter, subscribe to my Forbes feed, and pick up a copy of my sci-fi novel, The Last Exodus, and its sequel, The Exiled Earthborn.Also on Forbes:"	Science

100	By Matt Tran  - Mar 10, 2014Titanfall currently leads the games pre-order chart by some distance, before its release later this week.  The Xbox and PC exclusive has seen a huge surge in reservations in the last week, with the first person action shooter ready to storm on to the scene come March 14th.Last week in the US according to VGchartz, Titanfall for Xbox One saw a spike in pre-orders for 58,911 copies.  This now takes the total figure of Titanfall reservations to 378,466 across the country with Xbox One bundles also going up for sale on launch day.Titanfall also features twice again on its other platforms in the top 20 of the pre-order chart, with 7615 additional Xbox 360 copies being demanded last week.  This takes the Xbox 360 pre-order total to a reported 79,782, PC demand is slightly lower with 74,666 copies being set aside with 2682 of those coming in the previous 7 days.In total over half a million copies of Titanfall across its available platforms in the US have been pre-ordered, this figure will certainly pass 1 million once global release commences.  The game will also retail on launch day in stores and digitally.  Of the reported 532,914 copies demanded so far, roughly two thirds of them are for Microsoft’s Xbox One next gen console which will bode well for them.Which platform have you pre-ordered your copy of Titanfall on, are your expectations high after playing the beta?

101	"It will launch at 792p for now, but Titanfall’s resolution could be improved over time. 
Josiah Renaudin /
Updates /


Tomorrow, Titanfall will launch at the odd resolution of 792p. It’s not the ideal 1080p that so many developers are shooting for on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t get there through a bit of experimentation. Speaking to Eurogamer, Respawn lead engineer Richard Baker discussed the possibility of pushing the game’s resolution to either 900p or 1080p after launch depending on how the game runs.
""We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower,” Baker explained. “One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target.
""We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimize… we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 percent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it. For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship.""
Titanfall will hit the Xbox One and PC tomorrow. Expect reviews to hit later today. ↑"	Science

With the PlayStation 4 winning in next-gen console sales, Microsoft is hoping the ""Titanfall"" video game can jumpstart sales of the Xbox One.By no stretch is the Xbox One a flop, but the PS4 has sold six million units worldwide since its Nov. release, nearly twice what Microsoft's console has managed. According to the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft is banking not only on the sales of the Xbox One exclusive title, but that it will encourage gamers to buy the console.""'Titanfall' is an incredibly important game and it's coming at an important time,"" Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group, told the WSJ.Microsoft is selling ""Titanfall"" hard and spreading the news all around to gain interest in the title and also the console. With Sony's reputation for making a superior ""living room console,"" Microsoft is looking to do the same while also gaining an advantage in the games department. Yusuf also told Bloomberg News the new title will be a ""game changer.""""It's hard to overstate the importance of Titanfall to the Xbox One release this year,"" said Mehdi. ""For us, it's a game changer. It's a system seller.""The PS3 was Sony's first living room console, as it was also a Blu-Ray disc player, an online market for TV shows and movies and an Internet browser. Microsoft has followed suit, but the PS4's advancements have seemingly won users over again.Titanfall is so important to Microsoft because it has the potential to be the next great first-person shooter, the genre of the wildly popular ""Halo"" and ""Call of Duty"" series. Titanfall releases in North America on March 11, in Europe and Australia on March 13 and in the U.K. and New Zealand on March 14.The game is based on team-play warfare on a planet ravaged by war. On one side is the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation and on the other is the militia. User play as ""pilots"" who either run around on foot or operate giant humanoid machines called titans.Microsoft is expecting Titanfall to spur about 500,000 Xbox One sales in March and four million units of the title itself in the same timeframe, Bloomberg News reported.Join the ConversationNov 28, 2017 PM ESTBerkeley College  named as the Military Times Best 2018 listNov 28, 2017 PM ESTPeking University ranks 14th as university with the best employment ability for graduatesNov 28, 2017 PM ESTTop 10 Best Colleges in the World Included many colleges and universities in CaliforniaJun 28, 2017 AM EDTNASA official says no alien has been found until today.Jun 28, 2017 AM EDTOver 2,000 computers in about a dozen countries were affected.Jun 28, 2017 AM EDTDo celebrities really affect marketing?Jun 26, 2017 AM EDTFor most students, going into the Top 10 schools is a dream come true.

In the hopes of revitalizing Xbox One sales, Microsoft is offering a special deal on new video game title ""Titanfall,"" which will launch on Tuesday. The shooter adventure for Xbox will usually cost $60 but will be available for free with the purchase of a console for $499, The Wall Street Journal reported.Retailers at around 6,000 locations will launch the game with special events at midnight; Microsoft hopes the title will boost sales for the Xbox One, which has fallen behind Sony's new PlayStation 4.""'Titanfall' is an incredibly important game and it's coming at an important time,"" said Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group, as quoted by WSJ.Titanfall, which Microsoft has been marketing since last June, has a first-person perspective and takes users through an urban battlefield. Players in the game direct ""Titans,"" which are machines similar to robots that can be programmed to fight.Designed to be played with other users through the Internet, Titanfall has single- and multiple-player options. The title has had social media buzz on par with ""Call of Duty"" and has been the most pre-ordered video game in the country in the last month, according to the WSJ report.Perhaps Titanfall can bring up the Xbox One's lagging sales numbers. The console has fallen fairly far behind its main competitor, the PlayStation 4. In mid-February, Sony said its new console had sold twice as many as the Xbox One.Playstation announced at the time that the device was ""the #1 selling game console in the US in January, still #1 worldwide,"" GameSpot reported.Titanfall could become the new system-selling game, similar to the way ""Super Mario Bros."" defined Nintendo and ""Halo"" brought users to the original Xbox, WSJ reported. ""It has the potential,"" said Greg Blair, 31, of Appleton, Wis., who has played a beta version of the game.""It's a start,"" he told WSJ.2018 BMW 520i And 525d Specs Reveal Four-Cylinder Engine & 6.6-Second Acceleration Rate2018 Mercedes-Benz S Class To Offer A New Kind Of Mobile Yoga System?Dallara’s New Sports CarIs Coming Out Soon!

104	"Paul Thurrott | Mar 10, 2014Continuing its frenetic media blitz for a single game title that it hopes will reverse the fortunes of its Xbox One video game and entertainment console, Microsoft this week confirmed that it has a lot riding on the success of Titanfall. Should this game not succeed, and the Xbox One continue to fall further and further behind the PlayStation 4, it could face an awkward failure in devices at a crucial time.""Titanfall is an incredibly important game, and it's coming at an important time,"" Microsoft Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi told The Wall Street Journal. And just in case that wasn't clear, he similarly told The New York Times that ""it's hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox.""This is obvious to anyone who pays attention to the firm's strident marketing efforts, as I reported previously in ""With PlayStation 4 Sales Hitting 5 Million in Sales, Microsoft Pins Its Xbox One Hopes on Titanfall."" Microsoft has pushed Titanfall—which will ship only on its own platforms, including Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox 360—harder than it's ever pushed a single video game title. And yes, that includes such previous platform exclusives as Halo and Gears of War. Indeed, the firm's push for this one game rivals its marketing efforts for such products as Windows 8 and the Xbox One itself.And Microsoft doesn't even make Titanfall: the game is the creation of a video game studio called Respawn that was started by ex-Infinity Ward leads who were tossed out of Activision in a dispute over royalties. But this team, which created and then turned Call of Duty into one of the top entertainment franchises in history, is financially backed by Microsoft and supported both directly and indirectly by the firm's constant marketing of this one game. Can this team do it again?Related: ""Microsoft Sold More than 3 Million Xbox Ones in 2013""Microsoft's marketing of the game has been pretty effective so far, with private and then public beta tests of the game garnering much excitement and positive reviews from gamers and reviewers alike. And Microsoft could use a hit: Where the original Halo games legitimatized the first Xbox console in the eyes of hardcore gamers, the hope is that Titanfall will do the same for a console that many believe is too focused on non-gaming activities.Whatever the reason, the Xbox One is falling further behind the PlayStation 4 each month. At year's end, Sony had reported PlayStation 4 sales to customers of 4.2 million units, and Microsoft responded with a 3 million figure that obscured the gap since that included sales into the distribution and retail channels. Since then, Sony revealed that it has sold more than 6 million PlayStation 4s to customers, and NPD data for January shows that the PlayStation 4 beat the Xbox One in January sales by over 2-to-1 in the United States. The gap is growing.With the PlayStation 4 lacking a franchise title of its own, Microsoft would perhaps be better served by attacking some other weaknesses of the system. The Xbox One is still sold in far fewer markets than is the PlayStation 4, and it costs $100 more. So Sony's biggest advantages—distribution and pricing—are two areas where Microsoft should be able to make up lost ground pretty easily. I will say this: If Titanfall is anything less than a smash hit, you can expect Xbox One prices to start creeping downward.And in some ways they already have: Interested customers can purchase an Xbox One/Titanfall bundle that includes the console and the game for the same price ($500) as the console itself. If you were going to buy both anyway, that's a savings of $60. As with the bundle, Titanfall sales start tomorrow, on Tuesday.But the Xbox One's slow start is starting to stir unrest in Redmond. The Xbox brand is among Microsoft's strongest, and the Xbox 360, with over 80 million units sold, is considered a success despite a record $1 billion in warranty fixes due to endemic reliability issues. Until the Xbox One, it seemed that this one part of the company could do no wrong, and its users were considered the most loyal.With the Xbox One stumbling badly out of the gate—the firm badly mishandled the console launch last summer and has never really recovered—it's starting to appear that Xbox is suffering from the same disconnect with customers that is dogging the rest of Microsoft. Windows 8 got off to a terrible start as well, and has not resonated with customers despite recent improvements. Its Surface tablets, though well-made and expertly designed, have generated little to no interest or sales. And Windows Phone, though lauded by reviewers, has sold poorly, so poorly that Microsoft was forced to buy the part of Nokia that makes 90 percent of the Windows Phone handsets sold worldwide.Between the Windows 8-based Surface tablets, Windows Phone-powered Nokia handsets, and Xbox One, Microsoft could be on the cusp of device-related defeats on multiple fronts. For a firm that has pinned its future hopes on ""devices and services,"" that's an inauspicious start.More information about text formatsFollow us:"	Science

106	"We've played the beta, we've had system updates, and we've had controller tweaks. Now, Titanfall is almost here. Respawn Entertainment's online mech shooter drops on Xbox One tomorrow, and there's more at stake than just the broader FPS landscape in 2014. This is the first major release of the current console generation -- one that 
 
Microsoft
 has been touting for months as among the most important features of the Xbox One launch. Microsoft is all in on this one. It has to be big.Luckily, the beta/demo has already made its way throughout the gaming media and general public, serving not only to stress-test the servers but also give us all a taste of what does seem to be a genuinely excellent game. But for both the Xbox One and EA's sake, the technical end of the Titanfall launch needs to be flawless. EA has botched the launch of several high-profile online games recently, and one more could send shareholders and gamers alike into revolt. Microsoft has stressed the cloud and online capabilities of its Xbox ecosystem since day one, and this is the first game truly built to showcase that infrastructure. If it hiccups, it will be a major blemish on the company's reputation. Microsoft doesn't need another one of those.I'm bullish on this one. We've already played the game, so we know it is fun. The open beta should have ironed out server problems, and we can bet Microsoft is on hand to throw a whole lot of hardware at any problem that might arise. Without major problems, however, we then need to think about whether or not the best shooter of a young 2014 can galvanize Xbox One sales.
Xbox One is, from a historical perspective, selling very well. We should not only be concerned about the historical perspective, however. PS4 appears to be maintaining an impressive global lead, and we've yet to see how it will sell once supply starts to normalize. Momentum is hugely important in console sales. Developers and new players alike are naturally drawn to a more robust ecosystem, making these early days absolutely crucial. Yes, it will be a long generation. But PS4's early lead is going to be very tough beat.There are still a lot of consumers considering whether to buy a next-gen console, and there still isn't any compelling software to push anyone in either direction. Titanfall is likely the first game to start affecting such decisions, probably more so than PS4's upcoming Infamous: Second Son. Still, Microsoft is in for a fight, and I'm not sure how much of the gap Titanfall will be able to close. The game will sell well on day one, most definitely, but the real test will come in the NPD report for March, when we get to see if it moved the needle on console sales."	Science
107	"Titanfall is just few hours away from its official release worldwide and Respawn Entertainment has finally confirmed the long pending rumor, Titanfall ships at 792p on Xbox One i.e Titanfall Xbox One final build resolution is same as that of recently concluded Titanfall Open beta.The information was cofirmed by Titanfall's Lead Engineer Richard Baker in a recent interview to our friend at Eurogamer.Eurogamer asked Respawn lead engineer Richard Baker, whether fans can expect to see increase in resolution after launch? and to this he replied:""We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower.

The above response of Baker is pretty interesting because he emphasized ESRAM as an important factor and not the raw GPU power of Xbox One in an attempt to go for higher resolution i.e from 792p to 900p.Baker also added:

""A lot of the performance is on the GPU side. There's still room for optimisation and we're still working on it,"" Baker commented. ""Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 all the time when we shipped but obviously when there's big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects... we're still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.""

So there you have it folks, Titanfall on Xbox One will run at 792p, and fans should not expect to see a jump in resolution immediately after game's launch as Respawn is still working on it, and things will take time.Another resolution issue on Xbox One and again ESRAM term comes into picture.

108	The Xbox One version of Titanfall will launch at 792p, the same resolution as the beta.  According to Eurogamer, Respawn Entertainment has been trying to optimize the game to run at higher resolutions on the Xbox One, but haven’t been happy with the outcome.“We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship”“We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,” says Respawn Engineer Richard Baker. “We’re going to experiment.

This is despite rumours that the final resolution would be above 792p and closer to 900p when the game launches.“We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we’re going to use, so we’re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don’t have to have this larger render target.”Baker did reveal that the resolution is likely to increase going forward though whether it will be 1080p or 900p will depend. “We’re going to experiment.

110	There had been rumors about a Titanfall themed Xbox One console a couple of months ago, but the plan was apparently ditched due to its expensiveness. However, the same Titanfall themed consoles have now resurfaced. Only this time the source of the news is Respawn Entertainment itself and, sadly, they are not for sale.Recently, employees of the developer started sharing images of the Titanfall Xbox One console on different mediums and then an image of the same console was tweeted by the official Twitter profile of Respawn Entertainment. It was also confirmed in the same tweet that these consoles were not for sale – boo hoo.Almost hate to post this cause they aren't for sale but @Xbox brought our studio something amazing today: pic.twitter.com/tbmOyw51Um— Respawn (@Respawn) March 7, 2014Apart from the fact that the Titanfall Xbox One console will be out of the reach of the general public; there is another thing that caught my attention. The guy who leaked the information months ago had also leaked a couple of other things. If the leak about Titanfall themed consoles is true, it would make sense if the rest of his predictions are true as well.The same guy had also claimed that Halo 2 Anniversary Edition will be released this year. Other juicy claims that he had made over the time include Forza Horizon release in fall 2014, Quantum Break release in holidays 2014, a $299 Xbox One ‘maybe without an optical drive,’ Crackdown 3 to be a 2016 title, Fable Legends to come in summer 2015 and lastly, that the first Titanfall DLC would come 45 days from release.Check out how many of these are/or could be true.

With a digital version available for every platform the game is going to exist on at launch, there’s a good chance you could be stuck waiting for your game to download instead of playing when the servers go live. Unless of course, you preload your game.If you’re not planning to wait in line at your local game store at midnight to pick up the small person-sized Collector’s Edition box for PC, digital folks will be seated comfortably at home when Titanfall launches for the US. Whether you’ve purchased the game directly from the Origin store or are waiting for it to become available for purchase on Xbox Live, we’re only a few hours away from the launch.PC owners will have the ability to preload Titanfall, meaning if you purchase the game now you can have everything ready to go the second it goes live in your timezone. According to Respawn, the launch of Titanfall will be staggered like this:United States: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PDT
Canada: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PDT
Mexico: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PST
Brazil: 3/11/14 – 4:00 AM BRT
Austria: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET
France: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET
Germany: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET
Ireland: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM GMT
Italy: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET
Spain: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET
United Kingdom: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM GMT
Australia: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM AEDT
New Zealand: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM NZDTPreloading the game is easy. If you’ve already purchased Titanfall for your PC, you’ll see a preload option available to you in the Origin app on your computer. If you haven’t made the purchase yet, you’ll see the preload option appear as soon as the transaction is complete and Titanfall has been added to your Library. If you pre-ordered the game at a retail outlet, you’ll be provided with a code that will add the game to your Library, which means you can’t preload without that code.If you’re planning to purchase the game digitally on the Xbox One, you’ll need to wait until it is available on Xbox Live to do so. The game will then need to download and install, and neither Microsoft nor Respawn has announced a preload function for the console version yet.There will be no “Day One” update for Titanfall on the Xbox One to address the resolution of the game, which was suggested when the Beta rolled out last month. Just like the Beta, Titanfall on the Xbox One will run at 792p. There may be an update later on that addresses this (and gets it nearer to 900p), but at launch the game will likely look almost exactly like the Beta.

While you were busy running along walls and throwing missiles back at your opponents during the Titanfall beta, countless data centers across the world were making sure that each AI-controlled Titan bodyguard had your back. Much of the frenetic action in Respawn Entertainment's debut game rests on one thing: Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure.

Up until last November, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's baby was mostly used for business applications, like virtualization and acting as an enterprise-level email host. With the Xbox One, though, the company opened up its global server farms to game developers, giving them access to more computing power than could reasonably be stuffed into a $500 game console. Since the Xbox One's debut, Microsoft has been crowing about how Azure would let designers create gaming experiences players have never seen before. Now it's time for the product to speak for itself.
While you were busy running along walls and throwing missiles back at your opponents during the Titanfall beta, countless data centers across the world were making sure that each AI-controlled Titan bodyguard had your back. Much of the frenetic action in Respawn Entertainment's debut game rests on one thing: Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure.

Up until last November, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's baby was mostly used for business applications, like virtualization and acting as an enterprise-level email host. With the Xbox One, though, the company opened up its global server farms to game developers, giving them access to more computing power than could reasonably be stuffed into a $500 game console. Since the Xbox One's debut, Microsoft has been crowing about how Azure would let designers create gaming experiences players have never seen before. Now it's time for the product to speak for itself.With Tuesday's release of the online-multiplayer-only Titanfall, Redmond's gamble takes center stage. Players are no doubt concerned about the game's stability at launch. With one look at the problems that plagued Diablo III, SimCity and Battlefield 4, consumer skepticism is easy to understand. The folks behind Titanfall believe they've got a not-so-secret weapon to circumvent the foibles those games endured, or are still enduring, in Microsoft's server infrastructure. It's been in place and running pretty successfully since 2011.Respawn engineer Jon Shiring says that since the beta ended, some skeptical devs have already changed their minds about the feasibility of using Azure for the parts of a game traditionally handled by a user's console or PC. In Titanfall's case, that largely includes artificial-intelligence-powered teammates.""Back when we started talking to Microsoft about it, everyone thought it was kind of crazy and a lot of other publishers were terrified of even doing it,"" Shiring says. ""I've heard that since our beta ended, they've been pounding down the doors at Microsoft because they're realizing that it really is a real thing right now.""Shiring has touched on what Redmond's back-end would allow before, but even then, it wasn't clear just how intrinsic Azure was to the game's twitch-based multiplayer mayhem. Aside from providing dedicated servers for low-lag online matches, Azure's remote horsepower is part of what sets Titanfall apart from contemporary first-person shooters.To understand how Respawn ended up working with Microsoft, we have to travel back to 2007, back when Miley Cyrus was still Hannah Montana and Call of Duty wasn't a household name.In the span of five years, Call of Duty house Infinity Ward sold millions of plastic discs and, with 2007's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, it established the prototype for current multiplayer gaming. After a very public falling out with parent company Activision three years later, key creative staff left the studio to form Respawn. While the new team was in the early stages of deciding what its first game would look like, Shiring was already pushing hard for dedicated servers. The downside, however, is that those CPU stacks and the space to house them aren't cheap. Luckily, Respawn had friends in the right places.""Microsoft got really interested in the idea, and that was early on,"" says Shiring. ""I'd say I started to nudge them in 2010, but it really was 2011 when we were coming at them like 'What can you do? We can't afford this.'""This was around the time that Redmond was deciding what to do with the online service for the as-of-yet unnamed Xbox One.""We knew in the early stages of developing Xbox One that we wanted to tap into the power of the cloud in a way that hadn't been done before,"" says John Bruno, Xbox Live's lead program manager. ""We were convinced that enabling dedicated servers using cloud computing presented a great opportunity to realize our vision for Xbox One.""Microsoft is providing the garage and the tools for game developers to work with, and, perhaps most importantly, it's keeping the rent cheap. By eliminating the hassles of setting up a game's cloud infrastructure, Redmond is letting developers focus on what's important: making killer games. For a startup like Respawn, that was pretty attractive and would allow the studio to achieve its vision with minimal compromise.While a good number of PC games use dedicated servers, most console titles rely on a player hosting each multiplayer session. This introduced more than a few roadblocks to Respawn's vision. For starters, it wouldn't allow for the resource-intensive AI-controlled combatants and busy battlefields the team had in mind.""Having these servers with a significant amount of CPU power and bandwidth available is absolutely essential to our game: Having these machines that are regional and servers that have good ping -- that's huge,"" he says. ""That has completely changed the way we make games.""Many look at Titanfall as the first true next-gen game, offering an experience we haven't seen on last-generation hardware (think: the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). From what Shiring says, the fact that Respawn wasn't held back by a console's local processing power was key to letting the studio achieve what it has.""There are other games like Battlefield that have dedicated servers, but they haven't gone the same direction that we have with them. We have all of this AI and things flying around in the world; that has obviously let us build a different game than we would have if we'd have gone with player-hosted,"" Shiring says. ""Really, the biggest thing with that is that it has uncapped our designers and let them do things that were previously impossible to do.""Because Titanfall's advanced AI is handled by the Azure servers, your Xbox's or PC's innards can be used to achieve more detailed graphics and the game's silky-smooth frame rate. The Titan bodyguards, dropships and legions of AI-controlled combatants are essentially free from a processing-power standpoint. Without Redmond's cloud, it's highly likely that Titanfall's six-versus-six player limit would be painfully apparent. Since these features live on remote servers, though, making sure they seamlessly appear in-game is paramount.Ping -- the time it takes in milliseconds to transfer data between remote machines -- is the crux of multiplayer gaming. Simply put: If it's too high, the bullets you fire at an enemy won't hit their target because your network is running slower than the game is animating player movement.For details on why Titanfall doesn't feature cross-platform play, check out the full interview with Respawn's Jon Shiring.Azure's regional data centers address this by providing a clean, semi-local connection point between your console and the server where it connects. Naturally, the lower your ping is, the better; most PC gamers try to select servers that have a ping of 100ms or less. Shiring tells us that when Respawn's offices in Los Angeles connect to the Azure data center in San Francisco, the average ping is 19ms to 20ms. ""We're talking barely more than one rendering frame to get a message to the server and back again, which is outstanding,"" he says.""What I've found is that a lot of the latency in consumer broadband is at the edges: Getting to another user is slower than getting to a hub and back again,"" Shiring says. Because the Azure data centers are regional, he says that the latency is a lot lower than what you would get if the connection was to another player. That means that every non-player-controlled character should do what it's supposed to do, when it's supposed to, almost anywhere on the globe.With Azure taking care of Titanfall's external AI elements, the speed that they're delivered to a game session needs to be near-seamless for a good player-experience. It has to feel like you're fighting alongside scripted AI teammates in a single-player campaign -- not like a typical, stuttery multiplayer match -- for the computer-controlled characters to be valuable. After all, a robotic bodyguard is useless if it takes even a millisecond longer for your Titan to detect an enemy than it does for the enemy to kill you. If the technology hiccups because of a slow connection, the illusion breaks. At its core, Respawn's use of Azure promises a consistently fast connection where you don't see the stitches holding the game together.These regional data centers also allow Respawn to keep everyone playing even if their closest server farm is overloaded. During the beta, the studio ran Titanfall on an intentionally limited number of servers to discover where the infrastructure's weak points were when running at a full load. Some 2 million people participated in the game's test run (across both PC and Xbox One) and at one point, a portion of Europe's data centers were running at full player capacity and couldn't accept more users.Respawn had a contingency plan in place: moving the affected players over to the East Coast US data centers, behind the scenes. This meant higher ping of course, but not by a dramatic amount. ""We don't look forward to doing that at all, but if we have a bunch of people sitting unable to play the game, then we're going to make sure that the experience is good enough -– maybe not ideal -– to get them playing,"" Shiring says.In a way, this was a method of answering the biggest question the developer could face during launch: What will happen if everyone tries playing the game at the same time and can't?""We're trying to figure out how many people will be playing and trying to make sure the servers will be there for that,"" Shiring says. Essentially, that's where Respawn's responsibilities end. If player experience is suffering at launch, that's on Redmond to fix.""One of the really nice things about it is that it isn't my problem, right?"" Shiring says. ""We just say [to Microsoft], here are our estimates, aim for more than that, plan for problems and make sure there are more than enough servers available -- they'll know the whole time that they need to bring more servers online.""Titanfall benefits from dedicated servers, but it's dangerously dependent on them to function; there are parts of the world where Azure data centers don't exist. Like South Africa, for instance. Because Respawn couldn't guarantee the quality of the experience, its debut game won't be released there. An entire country will miss out on a console game because of the lack of Microsoft's servers in the region.Shiring is keenly aware of the pressures on him and his coworkers to not only launch well, but also to maintain a consistent level of quality throughout Titanfall's lifespan. It isn't just the first tentpole title of the current generation of gaming; it could also be the killer consumer app for Microsoft's Azure tech.He expects that once his team's game ships and is complete, the studio will have more confidence that the grunt work associated with brand-new code and technology will be done. From there, other developers can build on Respawn's foundation. Shiring believes that, eventually, centralized hosting will become the new normal. He also recognizes the risk in being first.""Working with Microsoft is great, but we're kind of taking a bullet with doing the pain of proving that the game will scale up, and we're finding bugs that every system has at launch,"" he says.The only other proof that Azure actually works for gaming is Xbox One launch title Forza Motorsport 5. The game's Drivatar system uses the cloud to catalog your racing behavior and create a virtual driver that competes in other people's online races, earning in-game money while you're away. Doing laps around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, however, doesn't have as wide an appeal as, say, operating a three-story robotic death machine. Should Titanfall and Azure live up to expectations, Shiring thinks that Redmond's infrastructure could change how studios approach developing games. If he's right, this could lead to much more Respawn-style experimentation from other studios and maybe create entirely new genres of games as a result.""Suddenly, the publisher solution becomes more risky than the cloud solution,"" he says. ""That will be a big shift in the industry for everybody.""​The company's maps and directions keep getting better.It helps you feel temperature and pressure, but it can also take damage.It's free, if you have a cable subscription.A new study shows much higher error rates for people who aren't white or male."

113	"The biggest game of this new console generation launches tomorrow, as Titanfall crashes down to earth for a rare spring blockbuster release. The game is available across PC and 
 
Microsoft's
 Xbox One, but is notable for where it is not, namely 
 
Sony's
 PS4.For Xbox One in particular, Titanfall represents a potentially huge draw for the system which so far, has lagged behind the PS4 in sales. While I disagree with the notion that Titanfall needs to ""save"" the Xbox One, as the situation isn't that dire, it is a big moment for Microsoft, not to mention EA and Respawn as well.Tomorrow's launch is interesting for another reason as well. While the Xbox One gave up its digital download-heavy ambitions (for the time being), Titanfall will represent the first major test of what happens when a massive swarm of people try to download a new release of a hot game to their Xbox One.
Sure, at launch people may have been downloading Dead Rising, Forza, Ryse, etc, but now with TItanfall, this is one day and one game, and a huge number of players that may be thinking they want to save themselves a trip to battle the lines at Gamestop, and simply download the game through their Xboxes directly. This is a new console with a big hard drive after all, and if players don't think they'll be say, reselling a used copy of Titanfall any time soon, it may be time to get on board with digital distribution on consoles.Now we get to see if one of the major fears about download-heavy consoles is accurate. What will happen when hundreds of thousands or even millions of gamers all try to download the game at once? While the file size is ""only"" 20 GB for Xbox One, and not the 40 or 48 GB that was reported earlier, that's still not an insignificant sum.We've already gotten a taste of the issues with downloading console games as attempts to ""preload"" Grand Theft Auto V a day or so early went rather terribly. There's no preload option for Titanfall, which means the game will have be downloaded in its entirety on day one.While Microsoft ultimately bent to the will of the gaming public to keep discs alive, there are many mechanisms in place to try and entice players to go digital. They try to combat another common problem with digital downloads, that they take a long damn time to finish, with the fact that you can play a game before it's done downloading.The problem is, will this system work if so many people are trying to download the same game at once?There are now two gates for Titanfall to jump through in this sense. The first relies on the ability of Microsoft's online store to deliver the game seamlessly to countless players all demanding it at once. The second is on EA's shoulders as they have to ensure once the game is in hand (or on hard drive, as it were), that the servers actually work. The latter hurdle is one that EA has notoriously struggled with, and frankly there are few online-based multiplayer games that launch these days without some manner of connection issues. The fact that many might be choosing to digitally download the game through Microsoft adds another level of ""things that can go wrong"" on day one.All this said, if Microsoft and EA manage to work in tandem here, and the Titanfall launch is a smooth one, it will be one of the greatest silent gaming successes of the year. While it's true a lot more people will complain if the game doesn't work than praise it if it does, a working launch would go a long way to prove that both a digital download-only console is at least workable in the future, and that EA has managed to overcome their allergy to successful online launches.While whether or not the game is good is certainly the most important factor in determining a triumphant release, whether the game is accessible and working is almost even more important at this point, given how much we already know about the game itself from the beta/demo. While exploring every nook and cranny of the new maps will be fun, the first in-game mission will be actually being able to play. If Microsoft and EA can achieve that objective, it seems like relatively smooth sailing from there.Follow me on Twitter, subscribe to my Forbes feed, and pick up a copy of my sci-fi novel, The Last Exodus, and its sequel, The Exiled Earthborn."

114	"Jon Shiring, Respawn engineer
When in the development cycle did the relationship between Microsoft and Respawn form?Early on, we were trying to figure out what game we were trying to make. We had a good relationship with people at Microsoft from working on Call of Duty, so we got in touch with them. I was pushing really hard on dedicated servers for all platforms. I talked to Microsoft about that, and I talked to Sony as well. Microsoft got really interested in that idea, and that was pretty early on. I'd say I started to nudge them in late 2010. It was really 2011 when we were coming at Microsoft like, ""What can you do? We can't afford this, but we want to have dedicated servers for everything because we're trying to do new and interesting things.""Did you get the feeling that this was something it already had in mind?The feeling I got from it is that we kind of brought it up and they came back with an idea of how to do it because they weren't originally planning to do it. At the time, I think they were looking for interesting things to do for the Xbox One; they were trying to get a bearing on what would be a new, interesting way for Live to go. We hit them at the right time.How intrinsic is Azure to Titanfall?Having these servers with a significant amount of CPU power and bandwidth available is absolutely essential to our game: Having these machines that are regional and servers that have good ping -- that's huge. That completely changes the way we make games. Really, the biggest thing with that is that it has uncapped our designers and let them do things that were previously impossible to do. That far back, we were letting the designers run and just do whatever was cool and it was really, really key to making Titanfall what it is right now.What will a player notice that's different between Titanfall and another game that's using dedicated servers?There are other games like Battlefield that have dedicated servers, but they haven't gone in the same direction that we have with them, though. We have all of this AI and things flying around in the world; that has obviously let us build a different game than we would have if we'd have gone in with the constraints of it having to be player-hosted. All of these things that make it a much more lively world are actually the really big win.With all the platforms that are using Azure (PC, Xbox 360 Xbox One), was cross-platform play ever considered?Not really. Mostly, the reason for that is with the 360 version -- we're not developing it. My expectation (and this is an engineering answer) is that we're going to be patching all of these but we're not going to be the ones doing the patching on 360. We could get ourselves into a very bad spot where if we patched all the servers, the 360 people couldn't play for a while until Bluepoint (the studio behind the Xbox 360 version) applies the patch and gets it through cert. Just on a purely practical level with three different methods of getting a patch out there, it's not going to work.Then there [are] a lot of other problems you get, like if you were playing against a PC guy and you were looking at his player info. He's not on Xbox; I can't bring up the Origin info for him; you can't add him as a friend and send an invite to him. It's not one huge technical thing stopping us; it's a lot of little ones.What does the connection flowchart look like from a user's network access point to the servers? With Azure coming in, it seems like a chance for more ping or latency. In a traditional player-hosted game, you're still connecting to the player acting as a host, but you have to punch through all these networks to get there. I'm kind of getting into the gears here, but what I've found is that a lot of the latency in consumer broadband is at the edges: Getting to another user is a lot slower than getting to a hub and back again.Since we're talking to these servers in big regional data centers, the latency is a lot lower than what you would get if [the connection] was exactly the same, except it was a consumer on the other end of that pipe. We have somewhere around a 19ms to 20ms ping to this data center and it's up in San Francisco [from LA]. We're talking barely more than one rendering frame to get a message to the server and back again, which is outstanding. It has a lot of wins.Longterm, what kind of benefits do you think consumers will reap with the groundwork that Respawn has laid?Back when we started talking to Microsoft about it, everyone thought it was kind of crazy and a lot of publishers were terrified of even doing it. I've heard that since our beta, they've been pounding down the doors at Microsoft because they're realizing that it really is a real thing right now. We can scale high, and, if you do it right, the experience can be awesome. Working with Microsoft is great, but we're kind of taking a bullet with doing the pain of proving that it'll scale up, and finding bugs that every system has at launch.After Titanfall comes out, we're just going to have a lot more confidence that the early system-type problems are solved. From then on, it's probably a simpler solution than building something yourself. My expectation is that within a few years, this will be the new normal. Not necessarily Azure specifically, but a centralization of the hosting so it'll be big systems that are being used rather than all of these homegrown things that people have done in the past.At the Xbox One's reveal, Microsoft said the new Xbox Live has 300,000 dedicated servers, how many does Respawn have access to?We're trying to figure out how many people will be playing and trying to make sure the servers will be there for that. One of the really nice things about it is that isn't my problem, right? We just say [to Microsoft] here are our estimates, aim for more than that, plan for problems and make sure there are more than enough servers available.To go back to your development experience, how has Respawn's approach to multiplayer changed since Call of Duty?We're still client/server, but we re-approached every problem and solved it in a new way. Some of the high-level stuff matches up, like the client/server and the service that connects the clients, but everything else is very different from a network architecture standpoint. I've been making multiplayer games (Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 2) for a long time. A lot of it is just people here and even people at EA having faith in us that we know what we're doing. That has led us to things that were new, different and crazy.What's the contingency plan in case the servers start melting?This is one of the things we made ourselves deal with during the beta. The way it ends up working is that peak time in Europe is going to be much ahead of the US. We moved some Europeans over to East Coast US data centers, which is not ideal, but it at least let them play. We don't look forward to doing that at all, but if we have a bunch of people sitting unable to play the game, then we're going to make sure that the experience is good enough -- maybe not ideal -- to get them playing.We do have capacity at these other data centers that are a little bit farther away. If we have a situation like that, that's going to be my fault. If we fill up every data center out there, then we'll be there at Microsoft -- they'll know the whole time that they need to bring more servers online.When Forza Motorsport 5 launched, it used Azure for the Drivatar system. By all accounts it shouldn't have worked: It was a brand-new feature running on new software using then-unproven Azure tech. If Titanfall launches successfully too, it could galvanize Azure's reputation.What I actually think will happen, is if we come out and it works great and people play the game and see that it's a really good experience, [developers] will have a lot of serious discussions about ""my publisher has their own system for hosting, but I don't know if it will work. We have a lot of confidence in Azure because Titanfall did."" Suddenly, the publisher solution becomes more risky than the cloud solution.The company's maps and directions keep getting better.It helps you feel temperature and pressure, but it can also take damage.It's free, if you have a cable subscription.A new study shows much higher error rates for people who aren't white or male."

Being that gamers want to game, many of them were worried that if they started playing the game early they might get banned by Origin. Titanfall developer Respawn announced that it would not be banning people for playing early, but bans might be handed out if they stream content or put up videos.Later a thread turned up at reddit that gave PC gamers a work around that would allow them to play the game early. Apparently, that workaround didn’t sit well with Respawn and Origin. Respawn’s Vince Zampella has now said that people using that workaround might be banned after all.The tread that was on reddit showing the steps needed to get the game going on the PC has now been deleted. It’s unclear now if anyone was actually banned for using the workaround. Clearly gamers though it best to not tempt fate since the thread was deleted at reddit.

							Respawn: ""We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res.""						
															By Richard Leadbetter
									
							Published 10/03/2014
Titanfall launches at the same ""792p"" resolution as the beta code released last month, according to reports that surfaced over the weekend, and officially confirmed by Respawn lead engineer Richard Baker during a recent interview with Digital Foundry.We asked Baker whether we can expect to see any post-beta resolution shifts, bearing in mind comments attributed to Respawn community manager Abbie Heppe, who indicated that final resolution may be in the region of 900p.""We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target,"" Baker told us. ""We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it. For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship.""What's curious about this response is that ESRAM utilisation appears to be key for Respawn as opposed to raw GPU power, as the jump from 792p to 900p, and again to 1080p are highly significant resolution bumps unlikely to be resolved by switching away from multi-sampling anti-aliasing (MSAA) alone. However, theoretically, dropping MSAA from a 1408x792 framebuffer could free up enough ESRAM to accommodate a 1080p image. In our recent tech analysis of the beta, we were curious about how Respawn could increase resolution so dramatically when the 792p code we played had issues sustaining a locked 60fps. Preliminary performance analysis from the Xbox One version of Titanfall, captured here in its beta incarnation. Respawn tells us to expect average performance in line with the code you may have already played, but with the worst-case scenarios improved.""A lot of the performance is on the GPU side. There's still room for optimisation and we're still working on it,"" Baker commented. ""Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 all the time when we shipped but obviously when there's big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects... we're still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.""Baker did reveal that we can expect to see some performance increases in the shipping game, based on optimisations carried out after the beta concluded. ""There was an issue with decals taking a lot more time than they should which we fixed for launch,"" he said. ""The worst-case scenarios are better, I think. The average is probably about the same as the beta.""Buy Titanfall from Amazon [?]Xbox One

120	"Microsoft Corp. was hoping to boost the sales of its Xbox One with it shooter video game Titanfall.The game console, Xbox One, just occupies a small portion of Microsoft's business, but plays a vital role to the software giant's future as its hardware success greatly influence the future of entertainment.In order to draw a large market for its Xbox One, the company is depending on Titanfall, which can only be exclusively played on the company's products -- the Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Windows PC. The company chose the game among others because it has already received significant positive recognitions and commendations, plus the fact that it is developed by Vince Zampella, a well-known game designer and creative chief of Respawn Entertainment.Zampella is part of the team that created the very famous game series, Call of Duty, which took home a whopping $9 billion-worth of profit.Titanfall, which is meant to be played online, is designed with eye-popping effects and a monopoly over the widest screens to reclaim itself and its genre. It is believed to push the idea of high-definition gaming. It is due in stores this week.""It's hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox,"" sad Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's chief marketing and strategy officer for devices and studios, in an interview with New York Times.To show its reliance on the game in boosting sales of its Xbox One, Microsoft will be bundling it with the game console at the same price. It is safe to think that the software giant is giving Titanfall for free to those who will buy Xbox One.Though the strategy looks promising, Microsoft still has to work hard in convincing gamers that Xbox One is worth it and better than its rival, Sony PlayStation 4, which has reportedly sold more than six million units worldwide."

123	Players who have been playing Titanfall on Xbox One ahead of its official launch have probably received a day-1 update by now.Sizing a massive 840 MB, the day-1 update increases the install size of the game to 16.3 GB. As for the digital version of the game, it’s believed to include the update and size around 16.39 GB.Previously, while speaking to GameSpot, CEO of Respawn Entertainment, Vince Zampella stated that they were working on a day-1 patch.I mean the game’s obviously not done yet. (Bluepoint Games is) doing a port of our game (Xbox 360 version). We just started our day on patch, so they now have to take that and integrate it into their game. So, they’re naturally lagging behind us. The goal is to get it as close as possible. Obviously it won’t be exact. It’s on a less powerful system.Although the patch has gone live today, there are no official patch notes to be found. Furthermore, if you recently bought the game for Xbox One, note that you’ll also have to download a 20 GB mandatory install before you could play the game.In other Titanfall news, Vince Zampella has confirmed that people who have managed to nab a physical copy of Titanfall (Xbox One version) can play it early Without Worrying About a Ban-Hammer from Microsoft or Repsawn Entertainment. He did, however, forewarn about some server and other minor issues.About playing early; we won’t stop or ban legit copies, it is prelaunch. So there may be interruptions in service as we prep servers.Titanfall officially launches tomorrow (March 11, 2014) in North America and on March 14 in UK for Xbox One and PC.	Science

2014-03-10T12:26:24.68ZIt's a lot of work to transport electronic data. To get Titanfall to the UK, Respawn will presumably have to manually print every line of code, pack it into a secure, waterproof crate, and then sail it over the Atlantic. Once it arrives, all that data must then be typed into the UK's internet, probably by Johnny Lee Miller's fictional character from the movie Hackers.At least, that's the only sensible scenario for having staggered international release dates. And yet,  Titanfall pre-loading is now available  for pre-ordered digital copies. It suggests that, rather than some tricky infrastructural hurdle, the reason many countries won't be able to play the game until later this week is down to the usual prioritisation of physical media, and the unwillingness of brick and mortar stores to deviate from their traditional release window.
Release dates and times have now been clarified by EA in a blog post accompanying their pre-load announcement. If you live somewhere in the world, this is when you'll be able to play the game:            Of course, such a staggered launch isn't unusual. For big games that still have a physical presence, it's only the very biggest that can pull off a day-and-date international launch. Still, it's a constant irritation, as - thanks to the connectedness of the internet - many countries will get to spend tomorrow hearing from people enjoying the game, while unable to play their own copies.Subscribe to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

126	Respawn Entertainment’s new game for Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Windows operating systems, Titanfall, is set to have a midnight release event in Sydney, Australia. Titanfall is a first-person, multiplayer shooter in which players can fight each other in mechs and as puny infantry with jetpacks… which I guess isn’t so puny. The game is slated to become the new flagship franchise for the Xbox One console and has had previous coverage by us, here. Fans are invited to attend the event at the headquarters of the fictional ‘Hammond Robotics Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation’ and hosted by the not-fictional: EA, EB Games, and Xbox Australia. Guests will be able to play the full game in 6v6 online matches prior to the game’s national release and opportunities to purchase the full game will be provided during the event by EB games as well as other merchandise. Inquiries about the possibility of purchasing a real titan for personal use were only answered with bemused laughter, so one assumes that they must be provided complimentary to guests.With every purchase (of a non-titan item), guests will go into the draw to win various prizes ranging from Xbox One consoles, Collector’s Editions of Titanfall, and much more (possibly more titans… for your friends). Also during the event, every purchase of the game will come with a free shirt but only while they’re in stock (I assume that every guest will be guaranteed their own titan however). In between games and (I assume) riding around in your own titan, guests will be treated to food, drink, and other entertainment. The luxury taxi service, Uber, will be providing guests with a $50 voucher for the evening if they wish to be ferried home with their service. Invitations are only being extended to fans 18 years of age and over as I assume children will not be able to reach the piloting controls of the life-sized titans.If you would like to be put on the guest list for the event, which will be held at Luxe Studios, 279-283 Liverpool Street, East Sydney on Wednesday 12th of March, register your interest at hammondrobotics@ea.com with your full name and contact details. The full game will be available on PC and Xbox One in Australia on the 13th of March and the 14th of March for gamers in New Zealand.Edit: Much to my disappointment, there won’t be real-life titans at the release event… I’ll have to console myself by playing Titanfall until real world technology catches up with my ambitions.

Several Playfight team members also said on Twitter that they are heading to Austin for SXSW, teasing a Titanfall announcement.Respawn and Electronic Arts have yet to confirm if the website is officially tied to Titanfall, and it’s also suspicious that it’s registered in Panama, so you should take all of this with a grain of salt.GameSpotGaikai had already put out concept images for their upcoming game-streaming service PlayStation Now but now the site has updated to reveal potential prices for some of the games on offer.Far Cry 3 would cost $5.99 and Uncharted 3 would retail for $4.99 while The Last of Us will cost $49.99. This shouldn’t be taken as official confirmation of prices – it’s more than likely that these are placeholder prices.PlayStation Now is currently in the beta stage and will release this Summer.GamingBoltHighstreet entertainment retailer HMV is to exit the pre-owned video games market, it has been confirmed to VideoGamer.com after first being reported by Frugal Gaming.All pre-owned video games will be marked for clearance beginning today with a discount of 70 per cent on all stock.The discounts should see used PS4 and Xbox One titles being sold for under £15 – if you can find stock.Videogamer.com Build your own custom daily newsletter with updates on your favorite teams, sent directly to your inbox.Your privacy is safe with us.

130	"Modern ReadersBreaking World, Tech, Sports, Business  NewsJudging by all the advance hype it’s received, Titanfall definitely isn’t worthy anymore of being called “Titanfail”, despite its launch having been delayed last year.  In fact, it could be an essential product for Microsoft, as it hopes the game will drive more Xbox One sales and makes it more competitive against Sony and the PlayStation 4.  But it would be better, of course, if gamers can pick up a copy of the game ahead of its March 11 release date, or on the release week itself, for less.  Here’s a look at some of the Titanfall deals available, though as you’ll see here, there isn’t much to choose from.To set gamers’ expectations, we might as well admit that all these deals are “deals with a twist” – in this case, they don’t offer any actual discount, but try to sweeten things in preparation for the Titanfall release date by bundling in a nominal goodie or two.  For example, Walmart is selling Titanfall at the full retail price of $59.99, but is offering pre-order customers with a $4.99 voucher from the Walmart VUDU movie streaming service, and a mission patch.  That’s not much, but VUDU members can make good use of that voucher, if it’s any consolation.Amazon’s deal wherein Titanfall pre-order customers get a mini Prima Guide free of charge has just expired as of March 7, and that would’ve been a sweet “deal with a twist” compared to the others.  And that’s left pickings extremely slim, with GameStop offering a free game poster and nothing else and, like all the other retailers covered here, selling the game at full retail.  And strangely enough, Microsoft has one of the best deals out there so far, selling Titanfall at its regular price, but bundling a $10 gift card for Xbox Store customers, or selling the game for only $39.99, provided buyers are willing to commit to and pay for one year of Xbox Live Gold.

132	"Gamers never welcome rule changes, unless those rule changes are for the better. If a company says that it won’t ban accounts for playing a game early and then changes its mind, gamers will get angry. That is exactly what may happen with Titanfall.
Some people that ordered Titanfall have already been able to get their hands on the game early. Titanfall developer Respawn had said that it didn’t want any streaming of the game to happen before the March 11 launch date of the game, but it would not ban accounts for gamers that sign on and play early.Playing might be allowed, but any video showing up online would likely result in a ban. Reports are now indicating that Origin might be banning early Titanfall players on PC after all. At least that may be the case for PC Titanfall players that are using some sort of work around to enable early access to the game.The workaround for PC gamers was originally posted on Reddit and the thread has been deleted since then. The PC workaround involved using a VPN to change your IP location and the downloading of a modified .exe file for the game. Reports indicate this work around allowed the PC gamers to boot into the game, but servers to play on were hard to find according to reports. The rub here is that gamers were told they could play the game early, and then when a work around making it easy to play early surfaced the ban hammer was threatened. There is no word at this time if anyone has actually been banned for using the workaround.SOURCE: Escapist Magazine"	Science

134	"Standby for The Art Of Titanfall drop commander. We may not be getting the Titanfall game anytime soon, but one thing that SA fans will have access to, is a behind the scenes tomb of Titanfall knowledge. So throw those older, tinier art books that came with your various collector’s edition out of the way, because the daddy of concept art has just dropped in.Right from the start, the massive book just slaps you in the face with a glossy mechanised penis of art. It’s chunky, big and will most likely inflict all manner of blunt force trauma should you find yourself stuck in zombie apocalypse.So what do you get inside the book? Well, it’s just shy of 200 pages, but it covers a ton of development, from the early days of Respawn Entertainment, through to the final design phase. It’s filled with all manner of art. Paper and pencil, Maya, 3D sculpting and various other digital paintings adorn the pages of mechs, beasts and environments. Hell, there’s even a section dedicated to that ridiculously massive full scale Titan that appeared at E3.The real bonus here however, is the insight into the design process. It’s one thing to gawk at a pretty picture, but if you fancy yourself an artist, it’s even more fascinating to read what went on in the heads of the Respawn art team when they were designing the look of the game.Make no mistake though, the Titans steal this book. They’re the key driving force behind the hype for the game, and the book spends plenty of time and pages on them, with fewer sections dedicated to the humans, and far fewer to the beasts of the game.Still, as a gigantic fan of our eventual robot overlords and future masters, I’m not complaining. There’s also plenty of attention lavished on the underrated and criminally underlooked aspect of art design in games, scenery. At least half of the book is focused on this, and the majority of that art is beautiful enough to warrant being framed and displayed in an art museum.Bugger the Monets and Jackson Pollock art enemas, this is the kind of visuals that artists live to create. If you’re a fan of art books, the The ARt of Titanfall has it all. Much like it’s source material, it’s massive, shiny and the sheer weight will crack your coffee table.A new generation of gaming is at first, all about the visuals. And that’s something that The Art of Titanfall accomplishes in an old school medium. Whether you’re in love with the game, or you want to show off just how much effort goes into making a video game, it’s a book that gives you plenty of value for the price it asks.Last Updated: March 10, 2014

You’ll have to reload your rockets before that fellow Titan rounds the corner, not afterwards.The improvement program starts here. Pre-load your copy of Titanfall before it unlocks on Origin later this week, and that’s 50GB you won’t have to install while everybody else is hopping off roofs and stabbing strangers with data knives.

It’s officially released on March 14 - but as is now the norm on Steam and Origin, players with pre-ordered copies are already able to download the game in preparation. In an age of digital distribution where bandwidth is still a bottleneck, that’s fast becoming the only compelling reason to buy PC games before you know how many bugs they’re bundled with.
For what it’s worth, this one felt extraordinarily focused and polished during our brief time in the Titanfall beta. Not one of our four pilots reported bugs or texture pop-in. Only occasional stutter at the highest graphic settings threatened to spoil our mech-augmented fun.

					Titanfall launches this Tuesday in the States, and one gamer who claims to have his paws on the Xbox One edition ahead of launch has come forward to say it runs at 792p. Meanwhile, Respawn boss Vince Zampella has said his team is striving to get the PC version up to 60FPS.It follows this round of live-action Titanfall content. Hit the link to see it.Over on Reddit; user revimack has compared some 792p beta screenshots with those taken from the final Xbox One build. He’s determined that they are the same resolution.“Respawn indicated that the retail version of Titanfall would ship at an increased resolution,” they began. “Based on some careful pixel counting (measuring the amount of aliasing artifacts on flat edges), I’ve concluded that the Xbox One version of Titanfall is not rendering at an enhanced resolution relative to the beta. The One version of Titanfall still renders at 792p.”They posed two beta screens here and here, then two shots from the final build here and here.Meanwhile; Zampella told one fan that Respawn is working on getting the PC build up to 60FPS:@AjayLikesGaming no, but working on it— Vince Zampella (@VinceZampella) March 8, 2014Gamers presently must use V-Sync to view Titanfall at 60FPS, which can result in lag and screen-tearing.

139	"One of the most awaited video games of this year is set to launch in a few hours, and yet we’re still receiving an interesting piece of news. Apparently, some still unknown live-action original content will be coming our way from game creators Respawn Entertainment and VFX studio Playfight.
Playfight might not be a name familiar to many, but the studio has had a following, particularly over the Internet. Its demo reel over at its website demonstrates a knack for high-octane action scenes and lavish, though sometimes over the top, visual effects. Perhaps just the right formula for a live-action tie-in to Titanfall.Set in a futuristic, war-torn world, Titanfall is, itself, fast-paced, first person, online multiplayer deathmatch that puts players in control of pilots who themselves control giant mechas called Titans. The game is one of the most anticipated titles this quarter for its graphics quality, unique gameplay concept, and, of course, being the poster child for the Xbox One.This collaboration between Respawn and Playfight is still shrouded in mystery, apart from saying that the two have teamed up to bring original content within the Titanfall universe. It is likely that this content will take the form of a short video tie-in that will be launched at the same time as the game. The teaser trailer on the supposed collaboration site simply contains a countdown timer to the game’s launch itself.That, thankfully, shouldn’t be long now. Based on that time, it wil  just be a matter of 9 hours before Titanfall, or at least this trailer, gets released. Be sure to keep an eye on our Titanfall tag portal to be updated on the latest news about this upcoming game.SOURCE: Your Titan Is Ready

140	Vince Zampella says he assumes Origin will ban players who modify game files to get access to the game early.Well, this is a bit of a tizzy. Earlier, Respawn Entertainment head Vince Zampella Tweeted that players lucky enough to score an early copy of Titanfall would not be banned, though he stressed that the servers would probably go up and down. Now, in response to a fans question about whether using a work-around to enable early access to the PC version of the game would get an Origin ban, he admitted that, yes, Origin probably would ban you for that.@SamSteele__ I assume Origin will, that isn't a legit way to play the game— Vince Zampella (@VinceZampella) March 8, 2014The work-around, which was posted in this reddit thread, has since been deleted, but it did involve using a VPN to change your IP location, and downloading a modified .exe file. Apparently, those who did the exploit were able to boot into the game, though some had trouble finding servers to play on.Any way you look at it, it is kind of sketch, so on the one hand, you can't really blame Origin for banning people who exploit it.On the other hand though, when you tell PC gamers that they can do something, well, don't be surprised when they figure out a way to do it.For now, even if you do find yourself with early access to the game, it might be best to simply err on the side of caution and wait until the official release date.Source: TwitterServed from: 192.168.10.92 | Version: com	Science
141	"A whopping 840MB download Titanfall releases on Tuesday, but as it is these days… copies have already hit the streets and many have gotten the game early. Word is from Respawn co-founder Vince Zampella that players are not going to be banned for playing the game early, but those playing the game early should not be surprised if servers go down for updates and such as the team makes final preparations for the game’s release. Respawn has no intention of banning users for playing the game early.We still have no idea what all is contained the day one patch for Titanfall, but we suspect that Respawn might give us an idea of what is included in the day one patch at some point in the future. Early buzz on Titanfall still remains strong, despite the negativity coming out of the PlayStation factions complaining that they are not getting a release of the game as well.There is a lot riding on the release of Titanfall for both Microsoft and publisher Electronic Arts. It will be interesting to see if this is the push that the Xbox One needs to finally get things moving in the right direction. Despite the two week delay in the release of the Xbox 360 version of the game, we suspect that it will sell very well and exceed the sales estimates that have been projected for the Xbox 360 version. We also expect that Titanfall will become the best-selling game in the history of the Xbox One within a couple of weeks post release.

If you like playing video games and root for the Seattle Seahawks, a visit to a Microsoft Store on Monday evening might be in order.Starting at 9 p.m., Microsoft is hosting parties for customers at its retail stores across the country on Monday to celebrate the March 11 launch of Titanfall, a highly-anticipated science fiction shooting game that Microsoft is counting on to help increase Xbox One sales.Gamers will have the opportunity to win prizes and play Titanfall before it is released to the masses on Tuesday. Those who head to the University Village and Bellevue Square stores in the Seattle region will also be able to meet Seattle Seahawks star cornerback Richard Sherman, who will be taking photos with fans and playing a little Xbox himself at each location.Sherman, who dominated headlines in January with his stellar defensive play and entertaining interviews, did something similar back in November 2012 for a Halo 4 launch party at the U Village Microsoft Store.“This is amazing,” Sherman told us in 2012. “I wish I knew about events like this when I was younger. They should have these kind of things all the time to bring people together. A lot of gamerheads would love this kind of stuff.”Sherman’s appearance at these midnight launch events are part of Microsoft’s partnership with the Seahawks, who won their first Super Bowl last month. Most recently we noted how Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has become the company’s unofficial athlete spokesperson for the Surface tablet.As for Titanfall itself, the game is launching exclusively on the Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. Microsoft hopes that the game convinces more people to purchase the Xbox One, which retails at $499 and has taken a backseat to the $399 PlayStation 4 in terms of sales. Sony announced last week that it had sold more than 6 million PS4 systems worldwide — compared to 3.9 million Xbox Ones sold — and outpaced Microsoft nearly 2-to-1 for PS4 sales in the U.S. during January.Microsoft last week announced an Xbox One Titanfall Bundle, which includes an Xbox One console, an Xbox One chat headset, one month of Xbox Live Gold and a copy of Titanfall all for $499 — currently the same price as the Xbox One by itself. Purchased separately, Titanfall costs $59.99, so Microsoft is offering a pretty substantial discount with the package.Titanfall, an online-only multiplayer game, was produced by Electronic Arts and developed by Respawn Entertainment, the folks who created the uber-popular Call of Duty series. For those that can’t attend the Monday launch parties, Microsoft is live-streaming the action from its store in Austin starting at 8 p.m. PT.Update, 3:30 p.m.If you were wondering about specific timing for Sherman’s appearances, it looks like the Stanford grad will be in Bellevue around 9:45 p.m. before heading back into the city for a 10:45 p.m. stop at the U Village store.Heading to the @MicrosoftStore in Bellevue tonight at 9:30 pm to check out some @Xbox #Titanfall.

143	We’re sure many PC gamers out there can’t wait to get their hands on Titanfall. The game looks fantastic and hopefully it will live up to all the hype and excitement surrounding it as well. Now the good news is that the game is currently available for preloading so if you’d rather not wait around during launch day for the download, why not start preloading the game now?As expected based on reports, it looks like the download weighs a hefty 20GB in size (give or take) which will soon expand to about 50GB after it has been fully installed, so gamers should probably make sure they have enough space on their hard drives before proceeding!Given its size, gamers should probably start preloading ahead of its 11th of March release, especially since we’re sure the game’s servers will be clogged during that period of time. It is unclear if PC gamers will face the same 840MB day one patch that Xbox gamers are required to download, but hopefully not.Now it seems that there have been some gamers who have managed to actually get the game up and running and connecting to the servers. According to reports from Reddit, this involves introducing a file called “TitanfallEarly.exe” which allows them to start playing the game ahead of the 11th of March release. Naturally this is a practice that would typically be frowned upon but Titanfall’s developers don’t appear too fussed.The game’s producer, Drew McCoy wrote, “Manage to score a copy of the game before 11TH? Cool! Try and play it – servers (or other players!) may or may not be available when you try. Be patient!” This was later confirmed by Respawn Entertainment’s Vince Zampella himself, who in a tweet wrote, “About playing early: We won’t stop or ban legit copies. It is prelaunch, so there may be interruptions in service as we prep servers.”So, who’s already downloaded the game and are getting their Titanfall on? Let us know how it goes!Filed in Gaming.

					Titanfall may be getting local server support in Australia after all, according to a not-very-mysterious comment from Respawn Entertainment boss Vince Zampella.Responding to a fan query on Twitter, Zampella all but confirmed Australians can expect local server support.“We’ll have good news soon for Aussies,” Zampella said.As a multiplayer-only title, Titanfall naturally requires reliable network performance to function. Although geographically distant servers aren’t the end of the world, for isolated nations like Australia and New Zealand, having servers on the same continental shelf can make a huge difference.EA has reportedly cancelled Titanfall in South Africa as local Internet infrastructure isn’t up to snuff.Titanfall arrives on PC and Xbox One on March 11 in North America, on March 13 in Europe and Australia, and on March 14 in the UK. The Xbox 360 version will follow at the end of the month.Thanks, Ausgamers.Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

A normal match of Titanfall is going to include at least two ""Did you see that?!"" moments. Like, two separate times where you literally say, ""Did you see that?"" Out loud. It might be when you dash through a ruined building, jump kicking half a dozen AI-controlled grunts to death. It might be when you pounce from rooftop to rooftop and barely make the leap to the evac ship as enemies try desperately to take you down. Or it might be when you eject from your doomed titan in the heat of a battle and watch from the sky as its nuclear core explodes, taking out every foe within a block. But no matter your skill level, and no matter how badly you're winning or losing, you're still going to feel the urge to scream, ""Did you see that!?"" because Titanfall--despite a few shortcomings--is a game that demands to be seen.You'll be amazed by how much is going on at any given time on the screen, even on the Xbox 360 version, which looks and plays almost exactly like its next-gen counterpart. The online-only FPS takes mechanics from popular modern shooters and mixes in new ideas to make for something that looks absolutely astounding. You're not battling in the streets of empty cities, you're fighting alongside AI soldiers, piloting massive mechs, and shooting at enemy players that can tumble through windows and run up walls. You kill fast, die fast, and move faster than you do in most other shooters, making for short, brutal matches that you'll want to keep playing again and again. When you get into the groove of things, playing matches of Titanfall feels like munching on potato chips; good luck having just one.If you were to strip away the unique elements you'd be left with a core that feels pretty familiar (which makes sense, considering the developer's history of making Call of Duty games), but that's easier said than done. The parkour? Those giant mechs? The AI minions? They're the bread and butter of the Titanfall experience. Minions might seem to be the least important cog in the machine because they're not as sexy as wall-running or mechs, but they serve the vital role of making every match feel bigger than it otherwise would. Though there are only 12 players in a session, there are at least twice that many AI-controlled allies and enemies running around at any given time. They skip around the battlefield and fight side-by-side with you, though they sometimes blow themselves up in absolutely remarkable displays of stupidity. AI units are downright dim-witted, which often leads to them staring at you like deer in headlights while you wave a shotgun in their faces. Their function is to die rather than kill, to fill the streets with corpses and serve as a morale booster.The Xbox 360 version of Titanfall was actually handled by separate developer, and it did a fantastic job of bringing the larger-than-life battles of Titanfall to the last-gen hardware. The gameplay is virtually identical, and it doesn't look a huge deal worse. There's some screen tearing and the lower resolution means it's harder to see enemies far away, but those are really the biggest issues. Basically, it feels like the Xbox One version is on a PC running at High settings, and the Xbox 360 version is on a PC running Medium. That's it. The battles are just as fast, the AI is equally as stupid, you can still run on walls and drop massive mechs on enemies.Minions also deliver short bits of story as you encounter them, be it by chatting about the battle or fighting enemies in well-animated hand-to-hand combat. Honestly, you'll likely get more enjoyment out of those bits of narrative than you will from the story elements of the game's lackluster campaign. Though wholly inoffensive, the multiplayer-online campaign is basically a one and a half hour playlist of multiplayer matches sandwiched between 20-second audio clips where characters gab about a war and talk about their history. They keep chatting as you play, discussing their plans as you compete in fairly standard games of Team Deathmatch and Capture Point (augmented with the occasional in-game cutscene). Win or lose, the story still moves forward, making your battles feel meaningless, and you feel like an NPC in someone else's story. Once the uninteresting tale ends you'll do it again as the other faction, playing the same matches in the same maps except with different characters talking to you, because it's the only way to unlock all of the titans.Playing through the campaign gives you time to learn how to take advantage of the parkour in a slightly less-competitive setting, an addition that raises Titanfall's skill ceiling tremendously. Being able to travel anywhere, on any wall, is incredibly freeing, and you might have trouble playing a first-person shooter without it afterwards. And in the rare instance it doesn't work perfectly, and you either clip through a wall or simply fail to grab a ledge for no discernable reason, you're still going to love the simple act of running and jumping more than you have in almost any FPS. It also means that the game's maps--all 15 of them--are constructed with verticality and multiple levels of explorable playspace, making for impressive level design (even if many of the locations look and feel overly similar).Besides being able to facilitate a dozen pilots jumping between buildings and running on walls, the maps are also capable of comfortably housing a bunch of huge robots engaging in massive battles. Titans are awe-inspiring--even the act of calling one down from the sky is awesome. There's a rumbling, you hear the crackling of a giant metal monster tearing through the atmosphere, and then they smash into the ground in a deafening thud. If you manage to have one land on an enemy titan, it'll destroy it outright; talk about a ""Xbox! Record that!"" moment.While titans are basically walking tanks, their maneuverability and customizability makes them much more fun. You're able to outfit your titan with different types of weapons and abilities, leading to hundreds of ways to approach going into battle. Want one that can make quick work of large groups of soldiers? Cool, slap a lightning gun on that sucker, give it the Tactical Ability that lets it shoot out Pilot-killing Electric Smoke, and watch as the sparks fly. Want to make a lean, mean titan-killing machine? Give that son of a bitch some big cannons, choose the shield that lets you catch projectiles and throw them back, and blast enemies into scrap. You can even treat them like giant, metal bodyguards by stepping out and letting the AI take over. They're much less proficient without a pilot inside, but the ability to have them guard a location or follow you around adds a multitude of strategic depth.And though titans feel so powerful you'll want to run when one rounds a corner (one cash in your direction and they can literally just step on you) they never feel unbalanced. Every pilot can carry one of five anti-titan weapons, capable of doing massive damage to the armored mechs if you're able to get a good angle. Plus, you're also able to jump on their back, tear off a chunk of armor, and shoot directly into the titan while riding it like a bull in a rodeo, which A) is really useful and fun, and B) is cool as shit, yo.When you mix together all of these unique elements, you're left with gameplay that's relentlessly cool. You'll run along a wall like a boss, hitch a ride on the back of an allied titan, and then shoot at stupid minions as the metal monster runs around the map; or you'll call down a titan of your own and get it to follow you as you sneak through buildings, picking off enemy pilots that are jumping along rooftops. Some of the most memorable moments happen during the Epilogue, where the losing team can escape on a dropship to earn a little experience boost. It might seem minor, but the mad dash for the ship--and the knowledge that you'll piss off the team that just beat you if you make it--is a much more fulfilling conclusion than simply seeing the word ""Defeat"" pop up on the screen after a loss.Titanfall's character development system follows a progression you're likely familiar with, including 50 levels of advancement in which you can unlock weapons, perks, and Burn Cards--short, one-time-use buffs that expire upon death. Compared to other shooters, the list of unlockables is somewhat paltry. On the one hand, this means that the focus is more on skill rather than weapon grinding, but it also means there's a lack of Pilot customization that might make you feel as though your choices are limited.But it's not all sunshine and robot battles. Whereas the gameplay is an artful evolution of the standard FPS formula, the innovation stops when it gets to the game modes, which are downright stale in comparison. There's Capture the Flag, Capture Point (called Hardpoint Domination), two kinds of Team Deathmatch (Attrition and Pilot Hunter), and Last Titan Standing, which is a round-based mode where everyone starts with a titan and you don't respawn after death. They're all augmented and improved with parkour, minions, and titans, but with exception of Last Titan Standing, these are all game types you've played before (and, honestly, even LTS isn't fundamentally different). Though you're doing cool stuff all the time, you're doing it in the same context as you are in just about every other shooter out there, and it's a bit disappointing.Titanfall's moving parts complement each other well, and take a familiar FPS formula and make it feel fresh--it's just a shame that it relies so heavily on the familiar. You'll eventually hit a point--like you do in nearly every game--where you feel as though you've done everything there is to do, and because you're still just playing Team Deathmatch or Capture the Flag, that time comes quicker than you might think. But while that holds Titanfall back from being a true revolution, you'll still have a damn good time dropping titans from space and kicking enemies in the head, all the while screaming ""did you see that?!"" at your TV.Titanfall blends familiar concepts with innovative ideas in remarkable ways, leading to a nearly nonstop supply of awesome moments. But for as fun as it is, you'll likely find yourself wishing Respawn was more ambitious when it comes to game modes, since there's a good chance you've captured enough flags for one lifetime.This game was reviewed on Xbox One.Get the best gaming deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable gaming news and more!GamesRadar+ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

					Titanfall is getting some sort of live-action promotional material thanks to a collaboration between developer Respawn Entertainment and special effects group Playfight.Very little is known about the project so far; it was announced via a teaser website called Your Titan is Ready.We don’t know when the project itself will be unveiled, about a countdown to a teaser trailer suggests we’ll know more in about 13 hours form time of writing.Playfight is the team behind Video Game High School and Call of Duty: Operation Kingfish, and has apparently “begun laying the foundation for the creation of original content within the vast expanse of the Titanfall universe”, whatever that means.“We wanted to partner with Playfight, who has a history of delivering movies that meld gameplay, live action and stellar CG into truly entertaining media, for Titanfall. What this collaboration brings is yet to unfold,” Respawn’s Dusty Welch said.Titanfall arrives on PC and Xbox One on March 11 in North America, on March 13 in Europe and Australia, and on March 14 in the UK.

Using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), astronomers have now confirmed Orion death stars destroy planets before they even get the chance to form, according to a study published in the Astrophysical Journal.Astronomers from the U.S. and Canada analyzed and documented the violent relationship between O-type stars and protostars in the Orion Nebula.""O-type stars, which are really monsters compared to our Sun, emit tremendous amounts of ultraviolet radiation and this can play havoc during the development of young planetary systems,"" said National Research Council of Canada astronomer Rita Mann, according to National Radio Astronomy Observatory press release. ""Using ALMA, we looked at dozens of embryonic stars with planet-forming potential and, for the first time, found clear indications where protoplanetary disks simply vanished under the intense glow of a neighboring massive star.""The Orion Nebula is home to hundreds of protostars called proplyds. Many of these will eventually develop planets, but others will have their planet forming dust and gas clouds stripped away by violent radiation from O-Type stars.The study revealed that protostars within 0.1 light-years, or 600 billion miles, of a 0-type star are in danger of having their cocoons of dust and gas stripped away in ""only"" a few million years, which is a lot faster than planets are able to form, according to the study.""Massive stars are hot and hundreds of times more luminous than our Sun. Their energetic photons can quickly deplete a nearby protoplanetary disk by heating up its gas, breaking it up, and sweeping it away,"" said the National Research Council of Canada's James Di Francesco, according to the release.Astronomers have previously accessed the Hubble Space Telescope to capture images of proplyds in Orion.By combining images from Hubble and ALMA with images from the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii, researchers determined that any protostar inside the extreme-UV envelope of a massive star would have most of its material destroyed. ""Taken together, our investigations with ALMA suggest that extreme UV regions are not just inhospitable, but they're downright hazardous for planet formation,"" said Mann. ""With enough distance, however, it's possible to find a much more congenial environment.

151	"Alderaan isn’t the only planet to fall victim to the “Death Star”, astronomers claim, though the vast O-type stars actually across the galaxy destroying young planets before they’ve had time to form don’t have convenient exhaust ports to stop them. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), a team of US and Canadian researchers discovered that huge quantities of ultraviolet radiation from stars at least 16-times the mass of our own sun can blast away the raw materials for new planetary systems.
Tracking stars and protostars in the Orion Nebula, researchers found that any protostars – that is, young stars the dust and matter around which often goes on to coalesce into planets – within 0.1 light years (around 600bn miles) of an O-type star would have their raw material cleared out by the radiation before it had a chance to cluster.“Using ALMA, we looked at dozens of embryonic stars with planet-forming potential and, for the first time, found clear indications where protoplanetary disks simply vanished under the intense glow of a neighboring massive star” astronomer Rita Mann explained. Usually, it takes a few million years for stellar dust and gas to begin to combine into something denser, and then over time form into planets. The raw material is believed to come from the explosion of huge stars going supernova, but ironically anything forming too close can end up being undermined by the radiation pumped out. “Massive stars are hot and hundreds of times more luminous than our Sun. Their energetic photons can quickly deplete a nearby protoplanetary disk by heating up its gas, breaking it up, and sweeping it away” James Di Francesco, National Research Council of CanadaAlthough telescopes like Hubble had previously allowed astronomers to see very young protostars, known as proplyds, in Orion, they lacked the ability to identify how much mass each had. However, using ALMA meant researchers could look inside the teardrop-shaped forms, to reveal what dust was contained.The differences proved striking. Within the extreme-UV read of a massive star, proplyds had less than half the dust mass required to form a planet roughly the size of Jupiter; beyond that, they could have anywhere up to 80x the mass of Jupiter in reserve. Future investigation, the team says, will hopefully indicate how common solar systems like our own are, and perhaps help in hunting down areas of space habitable for life.

153	"New ALMA observations show that massive stars blow away the gas and dust surrounding nearby protostars, preventing them from forming planets.This artist's concept shows two proplyds, or protostars, around a massive O-type star. The nearer proplyd is having its planet-forming dust and gas blasted away by the radiation from the star. The farther proplyd is able to retain its planet-making potential.The Orion Nebula (M42) is home to hundreds of young stars and even younger protostars known as proplyds. Many of these nascent systems will go on to develop planets, while others will have their planet-forming dust and gas blasted away by the fierce ultraviolet radiation emitted by massive O-type stars that lurk nearby.A team of astronomers from Canada and the United States has used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study the often deadly relationship between highly luminous O-type stars and nearby protostars in the Orion Nebula. Their data reveal that protostars within 0.1 light-year (about 600 billion miles) of an O-type star are doomed to have their cocoons of dust and gas stripped away in just a few millions years, much faster than planets are able to form.“O-type stars, which are really monsters compared to our Sun, emit tremendous amounts of ultraviolet radiation and this can play havoc during the development of young planetary systems,” remarked Rita Mann, an astronomer with the National Research Council of Canada in Victoria, and lead author on a paper in the Astrophysical Journal. “Using ALMA, we looked at dozens of embryonic stars with planet-forming potential and, for the first time, found clear indications where protoplanetary disks simply vanished under the intense glow of a neighboring massive star.”Many, if not all, Sun-like stars are born in crowded stellar nurseries similar to the Orion Nebula. Over the course of just a few million years, grains of dust and reservoirs of gas combine into larger, denser bodies. Left relatively undisturbed, these systems will eventually evolve into fully fledged star systems, with planets -- large and small -- and ultimately drift away to become part of the galactic stellar population.Astronomers believe that massive yet short-lived stars in and around large interstellar clouds are essential for this ongoing process of star formation. At the end of their lives, massive stars explode as supernovae, seeding the surrounding area with dust and heavy elements that will get taken up in the next generation of stars. These explosions also provide the kick necessary to initiate a new round of star and planet formation. But while they still shine bright, these larger stars can be downright deadly to planets if an embryonic solar system strays too close.“Massive stars are hot and hundreds of times more luminous than our Sun,” said James Di Francesco, also of the National Research Council of Canada. “Their energetic photons can quickly deplete a nearby protoplanetary disk by heating up its gas, breaking it up, and sweeping it away.”Earlier observations with the Hubble Space Telescope revealed striking images of proplyds in Orion. Many had taken on tear-drop shapes, with their dust and gas trailing away from a nearby massive star. These optical images, however, couldn’t reveal anything about the amount of dust that was present or how the dust and gas concentrations changed in relation to massive stars.The new ALMA observations detected these and other never-before-imaged proplyds, essentially doubling the number of protoplanetary disks discovered in that region. ALMA also could see past their surface appearance, peering deep inside to actually measure how much mass was in the proplyds.Combining these studies with previous observations from the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawai’i, the researchers found that any protostar within the extreme-UV envelope of a massive star would have much of its disk of material destroyed in very short order. Proplyds in these close-in regions retained only a fraction (one half or less) of the mass necessary to create one Jupiter-size planet. Beyond the 0.1 light-year radius, in the far-UV dominated region, the researchers observed a wide range of disk masses containing anywhere from one to 80 times the mass of Jupiter. This is similar to the amount of dust found in low-mass star forming regions.“Taken together, our investigations with ALMA suggest that extreme UV regions are not just inhospitable, but they’re downright hazardous for planet formation. With enough distance, however, it’s possible to find a much more congenial environment,” said Mann. “This work is really the tip of the iceberg of what will come out of ALMA; we hope to eventually learn how common solar systems like our own are.”

Orion death stars destroy planets before they even have a chance to form according new research by astronomers.Orion Death Stars Kill Off Planets Before They Can Form – photo from WikipediaUsing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, known as ALMA, astronomers from the United States and Canada studied the volatile relationship between O-type stars and protostars in the Orion Nebula. According to National Research Council of Canada astronomer Rita Mann:“O-type stars, which are really monsters compared to our Sun, emit tremendous amounts of ultraviolet radiation and this can play havoc during the development of young planetary systems,. Using ALMA, we looked at dozens of embryonic stars with planet-forming potential and, for the first time, found clear indications where protoplanetary disks simply vanished under the intense glow of a neighboring massive star.Taken together, our investigations with ALMA suggest that extreme UV regions are not just inhospitable, but they’re downright hazardous for planet formation. With enough distance, however, it’s possible to find a much more congenial environment. This work is really the tip of the iceberg of what will come out of ALMA; we hope to eventually learn how common solar systems like our own are.”The new research indicates that the massive and short-lived stars in the interstellar clouds which need dust and heavy elements that come from supernova explosions risk killing off planets in an embryonic solar system.Orion Death Stars Kill Off Planets Before They Can Form."

Does the author know the difference between ""Wreck"" and ""Wreak""?Well, I guess not so: 
Wreck: Your understanding of the English Language.Wreak: To inflict (vengeance or punishment) upon a person. 2. To express or gratify (anger, malevolence, or resentment); vent. 3. To bring about; cause: wreak havoc.Ah though, your parent's tuition fees were not entirely wasted I am sure. You can spell your name.

As a man born into this life, consciously aware of the spirit realm, past lives etc... I was led to make a unique discovery in this area of space. Yet, I struggle to share it with others, for so many are doubtful, closed minded, and foolishly critical, due to their struggling with their own sense of identity and position. This was not my discovery, but one that was simply pointed out to me, for everyone’s sake and  enlightenment.

162	"  How did small bands of nomadic Mongol horsemen unite to conquer much of the world within a span of decades? A whole book could be written on that, and it probably will be, if a new ""Indiana Jones"" movie gets made using Genghis Khan.The reasons are numerous and involve many different things but climate change is a less-considered one. Yet researchers studying the rings of ancient trees in mountainous central Mongolia say his conquest was likely due to nice weather. The rings show that exactly when the empire rose, the normally cold, arid steppes of central Asia saw their mildest, wettest weather in more than 1,000 years - maybe we can call it a Mongal Warming Period (MWP). Grass production likely boomed which meant the ability to feed greater numbers of war horses and other livestock. The tree rings spanning from 900 to 2011 also exhibit an ominous modern trend: Since the mid-20th century, the region has warmed rapidly, and the rings show that recent drought years were the most extreme in the record—possibly a side effect of global warming. In a region already pressed for water, the droughts have already helped spark a new migration in a vast region where people until now have lived the same way for centuries, moving herds from place to place and living in tents.Annual tree rings vary in relation to moisture and temperature, and can be read like a book. Study co-leader Neil Pederson of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory takes a cross section from a dead tree that may be well over 1,000 years old. Credit: Kevin Krajick/Earth Institute, Columbia University ""Before fossil fuels, grass and ingenuity were the fuels for the Mongols and the cultures around them,"" said lead author Neil Pederson, a tree-ring scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ""Energy flows from the bottom of an ecosystem, up the ladder to human society. Even today, many people in Mongolia live just like their ancestors did. But in the future, they may face serious conditions.""  In the late 1100s, the Mongol tribes were racked by disarray and internal warfare, but this ended with the sudden ascendance of Genghis (also known as Chinggis) Khan in the early 1200s. In just a matter of years, he united the tribes into an efficient horse-borne military state that rapidly invaded its neighbors and expanded outward in all directions. Genghis Khan died in 1227, but his sons and grandsons continued conquering and soon ruled most of what became modern Korea, China, Russia, eastern Europe, southeast Asia, Persia, India and the Mideast. The empire eventually fragmented, but the Mongols' vast geographic reach and their ideas—an international postal system, organized agriculture research and meritocracy-based civil service among other things--shaped national borders, languages, cultures and human gene pools in ways that resound today. Genghis Khan's last ruling descendants ran parts of central Asia into the 1920s.  Some researchers have postulated that the Mongols expanded because they were fleeing harsh weather at home--but Pederson and colleagues found the opposite. In 2010, Pederson and coauthor Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University, were studying wildfires in Mongolia when they came across a stand of gnarled, stunted Siberian pines growing out of cracks in an old solid-rock lava flow in the Khangai Mountains. They knew that on such dry, nearly soil-less surfaces, trees grow very slowly, are exquisitely sensitive to yearly weather shifts, and may live to fantastic ages.   In a series of expeditions, Pederson, Hessl and colleagues sampled the pines' rings, sawing cross-sections from dead specimens, and removing harmless straw-like cores from living ones. They found that some trees had lived for more than 1,100 years, and likely could survive another millennium; even dead trunks stayed largely intact for another 1,000 years before rotting. One piece of wood they found had rings going back to about 650 B.C. These yearly rings change with temperature and rainfall, so they could read past weather by calibrating ring widths of living trees with instrumental data from 1959-2009, then comparing these with the innards of much older trees. The trees had a clear and startling story to tell. The turbulent years preceding Genghis Khan's rule were stoked by intense drought from 1180 to 1190. Then, from 1211 to 1225—exactly coinciding with the empire's meteoric rise--Mongolia saw sustained rainfall and mild warmth never seen before or since.   ""The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,"" said Hessl. ""It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. Where it's arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower. Genghis was literally able to ride that wave."" (Each Mongol warrior had five or more horses, and ever-moving herds of livestock provided nearly all food and other resources. The rest probably depended on the Mongols' brilliant cavalry skills, smart political maneuvering and savvy adaptions of urbanized peoples' technologies.)  The tree rings show that after the empire's initial expansion, Mongolia's weather turned back to its more normal dryness and cold, though with many ups and downs over the hundreds of years since. The 20th and early 21st centuries are the exception. In the last 40 years, temperatures in parts of the country have gone up by as much 4.5 degrees F—well over the global mean rise of 1 degree. And, since the 1990s, the country has suffered a series of devastating summer droughts, often followed by a dzud—an unusually long, cold winter. The tree rings show that the most recent drought, from 2002-2009, compares in length and paucity of rainfall only to those of the pre-empire 1120s and 1180s. Perhaps more important: the drought of the 2000s was the hottest in the entire record. The heat evaporated water stored in soil, lakes and vegetation, and, in combination with repeated dzuds, devastated livestock. The last dzud alone, in 2009-10, killed at least 8 million animals and destroyed the livelihoods of countless herders. Now, displaced Mongol herders have formed a new invasion force—this time all headed to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, which has swollen to hold nearly half the country's population of 3 million.   Climate models predict that as the world warms, heat in inner Asia will continue to rise substantially faster than the global mean. Pederson says this means that droughts and other extreme weather will probably worsen and become more frequent. This could further reduce livestock and hurt the few crops the region grows (only 1 percent of Mongolia is arable land). New mining ventures and other industrial activities may employ some of the many people fleeing the countryside—but these also consume water, and it is not clear where that will come from.  ""This last big drought is an example of what may happen in the future, not just in Mongolia but in a lot of inner Asia,"" said Pederson. ""The heat is a double whammy—even if rainfall doesn't change, the landscape is going to get drier.""  Previous studies by others have advanced the idea that climate swings can change history. These include events such as the disappearance of the Maya, the expansion and fall of Roman imperial power, and, in a separate Lamont-led study, the 13th-century collapse of southeast Asia's Angkor civilization. Most focus on droughts, floods or other disasters that arguably have cut off empires; the new study is one of the few to explore the more complex question how climate might have invigorated one.
  The researchers ""make a compelling argument that climate played a role in facilitating the Mongol migration,"" said David Stahle, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arkansas who has studied the mysterious disappearance of the English Roanoke colony off North Carolina, coinciding with what tree rings show was a disastrous drought. ""But,"" said Stahle, ""we live in a sea of coincidence—something like that is hard to prove. There could be a lot of other factors. They've provided an incredibly important climate record, and put the idea out there, so it will stimulate a lot of historical and archeological research.""   The tree-ring study is the first in a related series by a larger interdisciplinary team working with Pederson and Hessl. Hanqin Tian, an ecologist at Auburn University in Alabama who studies modern grasslands, is working on models to correlate ancient grass production with the tree-ring records of weather. In coming months, team member Avery Cook Shinneman, a biologist at the University of Washington, plans to analyze sediments taken from the bottoms of Mongolian lakes. These can be read somewhat like tree rings to estimate the abundance of livestock over time, via layers of fungal spores that live in the dung of animals; this would confirm whether animal populations did indeed boom. The conquering Mongols left very few written records of their own, but Nicola Di Cosmo, a historian at the Institute for Advanced Study in New Jersey and coauthor of the current paper, will study accounts of the time left in China, Persia and Europe that might provide further clues.

163	"In the rings of ancient and gnarled trees, a team of scientists has found evidence of a period of consistent warmth and wetness in Mongolia between the years 1211 and 1225 -- the exact time that Genghis Khan first rose to power.Coincidence? They think not.This unusual stretch of mild temperatures and unprecedented rain in an area traditionally known for its cold and arid climate would have increased the productivity of grasslands in the Mongolian steppe, the researchers say. The abundant grass would in turn increase the number of grazing animals that could live off it.Members of Khan's army reportedly had five horses apiece, which allowed them to swiftly conquer an enormous area that stretched from eastern Asia to eastern Europe, as well as parts of northern India and the Mideast. They also traveled with a herd of livestock that provided them with food.""I think of it as nature set the table, and Genghis Khan came to eat,"" said Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University, in a video describing the research. ""He didn't have to come eat, and he didn't have to eat the way he did, but the table was set and it was a matter of whether or not the culture and the people capitalized on that.""Her colleague Neil Pederson of Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory put it this way: ""Grass was the power of the day.""The story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in scores of ancient Siberian pine trees that Pederson and Hessl first sampled on a whim during a research trip in 2010. The trees were growing on a nearly soil-less lava field in central Mongolia, dotted with horse skeletons. The researchers said that because the trees are severely water stressed, they are especially sensitive to changes in the weather.On that first trip, the two scientists took core samples from about a dozen trees. When they got them back to the lab, they discovered that some of those samples dated back more than 1,000 years. They also found evidence of a climate narrative that they couldn't ignore. For a small stretch of time, some of the rings were visibly thicker.""I was just excited that we had wood from the time of Chinggis Khan,"" said Pederson, using an Asian name for the ruler. ""And it was really the trees saying 'look how wide our rings are right here.'""Pederson and Hessl returned to the site two years later to sample more trees. Those samples confirmed the initial findings: The expansion of the Mongolian empire coincided with what the trees recorded as a warmer and wetter climate than usual.In interviews, both Pederson and Hessl said there was still more work to be done to definitively link the trees' narrative with human events. They are working with experts from disciplines including ecology, biology, and history to find more evidence of how the fortuitous change in climate may have contributed to the making of the largest empire in history.""There are still a lot of unknowns out there,"" said Pederson. ""The climate information in the trees is just one little piece of the puzzle.""If you agree that science is fascinating, follow me on Twitter for more like this."	Science

165	"Some 800 years ago, ancestors of modern Mongolians conquered the world on horseback. A period of unusually mild weather may have helped propel them by making them rich in livestock. PHOTOGRAPH BY KEVIN KRAJICK/THE EARTH INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITYPUBLISHED March 12, 2014For unsuspecting herdsmen in the 13th century, April showers didn't bring May flowers—they brought Mongol hordes.Related ContentNew research by tree-ring scientists from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and West Virginia University may have uncovered the reason why an obscure band of nomadic Mongol horsemen were able to sweep through much of Asia in a few meteoric decades 800 years ago, conquering everything in their path: They enjoyed an unprecedented, and yet-to-be-repeated, 15-year run of bountiful rains and mild weather on the normally cold and arid steppes.By sampling tree rings in the gnarled and twisted Siberian pines in the Hangay Mountains in central Mongolia, the team pieced together a remarkably precise chronology of local climatic conditions stretching from the year 900 A.D. to the present. The study, published in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offers a new interpretation of why the Mongols suddenly went on the move.To create the climatic chronology, the researchers sampled tree rings in ancient Siberian pines (like the one above) in the Hangay Mountains in central Mongolia.PHOTOGRAPH BY KEVIN KRAJICK/THE EARTH INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITYThe traditional view has been that the Mongols were desperately fleeing harsh conditions in their craggy, mountainous homeland. The Lamont-Doherty team, however, found just the opposite: Between 1211 and 1225—a period that neatly coincides with the rise of Genghis Khan and the Mongol empire—central Mongolia enjoyed a spell of sustained benign weather unlike anything the region has experienced during at least the past 1,100 years and probably much longer.""What makes our new record distinctive is that we can see 15 straight years of above-average moisture,"" says the study's lead author, Neil Pedersen, a tree-ring scientist with the Lamond-Doherty Earth Observatory. ""It falls during an important period in Mongol history and is singular in terms of persistently wet conditions.""More Grass, More Horses, More PowerThe long run of unusually good conditions meant abundant grasses and a huge increase in herds of livestock and war horses that became the basis of Mongol power—a marked contrast to the long and exceptionally severe droughts that gripped the region during the 1180s and 1190s, causing unrest and division.The Mongols saw their opportunity and seized it—and were fortunate enough that this great tide in their affairs happened to coincide with the rise to power of a vigorous chieftain who would go on to unite them: Genghis Khan.""The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,"" said tree-ring scientist Amy Hessl of West Virginia University in Morgantown, a co-author of the study, whose research was funded in part by the National Geographic Society's Committee for Research and Exploration. ""It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army, and concentrate power. Where it's arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower—literally. Genghis was able ride that wave.""Tree rings, which can be dated year by year, are clearly visible in well-preserved specimens.PHOTOGRAPH BY KEVIN KRAJICK/THE EARTH INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITYAnd ride it he did. By the time he died in 1227, he and his followers had founded an empire that would ultimately cover Korea, China, Russia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Persia, India, and Southeast Asia. Although the Mongol empire would break up over the centuries, some of Genghis Khan's direct descendants were still ruling pockets of central Asia into the 1920s.The timely change in climatic conditions that helped to launch the Mongol empire ""doesn't appear to have been associated with any change in volcanic eruptions or solar irradiance,"" says Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleo-climatologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. The task that lies ahead: determining if weather influencers like El Niño and the North Atlantic Oscillation might have brought the beneficial rains in Central Asia.High on a landlocked plateau, Mongolia is generally cold and arid, with tenuous supplies of grass and water. This huge lake is salty and shrunken from drought.PHOTOGRAPH BY KEVIN KRAJICK/EARTH INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITYMongol Invasion: Modern VersionThe climate chronology compiled by the Lamont-Doherty team reveals that the dawn of the 21st century has seen some of the hottest weather and most severe droughts in centuries—hotter and drier than even the severe drought years of the 1180s and 1190s. It also suggests that climate may play a role in a modern Mongol invasion—from the arid steppes to the crowded cities.The recent drought years have followed a string of fairly wet years toward the end of the 20th century. That's a double whammy, says Pedersen, since the relative abundance of rainfall in the 1990s could have made herdsmen less prepared for the harsh conditions of a severe drought.The hard years, coupled with sweeping changes in Mongolia's post-communist society, have sparked a mass exodus from the steppes into the country's capital, Ulaanbataar, where roughly half of Mongolia's three-million-strong population now lives.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified West Virginia University as the University of West Virginia. It also stated that the population of Mongolia was ""six-million-strong."" The population of Mongolia in 2013 was 3.2 milion people.© 1996-2018 National Geographic Society."	Science

167	"Genghis Khan had a key ally you might not have expected: a stretch of nice weather. That, at least, is what a group of scientists is saying is written in the trees of Mongolia.Human records of climate conditions only go back so far, but thankfully, the history of weather can inscribe itself in other deeply rooted sources like tree rings. A tree lays down a new layer of wood twice a year, creating recognizable rings. These rings tend to be narrower in times of drought and wider in good growing conditions. The science of scrutinizing tree rings is called “dendrochronology”; with it, researchers can read temperature and moisture trends stretching back hundreds or even thousands of years.Based on a study of 107 living and dead Siberian pines, with a tree ring history stretching over the past 1,100 years, a team of scientists from the U.S. and Mongolia found that the climate during Genghis Khan’s conquests of 1211 to 1225 was unusually warm and wet.“These climate conditions promoted high grassland productivity and favored the formation of Mongol political and military power,” the authors wrote in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.Some researchers had thought the Mongol conquests were driven in part by drought in Mongolia – the invaders might have been looking to grab more resources. And, indeed, the researchers found that Mongolia was experiencing intense drought conditions before Genghis Khan ascended to his leadership, between 1180 and 1190. That time also coincided with a lot of internal strife among the Mongol tribes. But as the weather turned, a new leader managed to unite the clans and expand outward toward all points of the compass.""The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,"" study author and West Virginia University researcher Amy Hessl said in a statement. ""It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power.

The rise and fall of the ancient Maya civilization appears to track the ups and downs of rainfall trends, another team of researchers hypothesized in a 2012 paper published in Science.The researchers also looked at recent drought conditions in Mongolia. Current climate models have pointed to a troubling scenario in Central Asia, which is expected to warm faster than the average temperature rise across the globe. In landlocked Mongolia, which is largely desert already, the strain could be particularly hard felt.""Energy flows from the bottom of an ecosystem, up the ladder to human society,” Pederson says. “Even today, many people in Mongolia live just like their ancestors did.

168	"The Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous empire in human history. But its meteoric rise and remarkable run might not have happened if it weren't for an uncharacteristic change in weather that brought sustained rainfall and mild warmth for a short period of time.At its peak, the Mongol Empire claimed an area that's now comprised of modern Korea, China, Russia, eastern Europe, southeast Asia, Persia, India and the Mideast. But prior to its ascension, during the late 1100s, the Mongol tribes were racked by disarray and internal warfare. This all came to an end with the rise of Genghis Kahn in the early 1200s. In a short amount of time, he united the tribes into an efficient horse-powered military state that rapidly conquered its neighbors and expanded outward in all directions.There are a number of theories to explain why it happened at this particular point in history, including the suggestion that the Mongols expanded because they were fleeing harsh weather at home. But a new study of ancient tree rings in mountainous central Mongolia suggests the opposite — that a temporary run of nice weather allowed the Mongols to take their show on the road. Indeed, as a band of nomadic warriors, the ability to sustain such a large fleet of horses was no small task. In fact, every Mongol warrior had five or more horses, while ever-moving herds of livestock provided nearly all the food and other resources.

    Tree-ring data sheds light on climate change's historic and modern impact.  
Monday, March 10, 2014 - 19:00 
    Marcus Woo, Contributor  (ISNS) -- The drought that devastated Mongolia in the early part of the last decade killed tens of millions of livestock, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee the countryside and seek new lives in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar — a shift that has been transforming the country ever since.Researchers now know that the drought was the hottest of the last 1,000 years and was likely exacerbated by global warming.As global temperatures continue to rise this type of severe drought could become more frequent, with potentially drastic consequences to central Asia, according to researchers.The new analysis is part of a larger study, which found that unprecedented rainfall in the 13th century gave Genghis Khan the resources to turn the Mongolian Empire into the largest land empire in history, spanning vast stretches of Asia and Eurasia.Together, the studies of wet and dry periods in 13th-century and modern Mongolia point to the way abrupt, decade-scale climate shifts can alter the fates of societies — for better or for worse.""They'll precipitate or catalyze rapid social change,"" said Amy Hessl of West Virginia University in Morgantown and one of the lead authors of the new study, published in the March 10 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Although this study of the Mongolian Empire has been reported previously, the newly published work represents the researchers' completed analysis.Mongolia is a traditionally nomadic society, in which 40 percent of the work force depends on livestock, according to the World Bank. The shift to a capitalist economy in the 1990s led to even more investment in livestock, Hessl said.But, between 1998 and 2002, three consecutive dzuds — severe winters made worse by a preceding drought — killed 20 million livestock. The especially harsh dzud in 2010 killed 20 percent of the nation's livestock population, or 8.5 million animals.The unrelenting dzuds sent the rural population flooding into the cities, primarily Ulaanbaatar. In 2010, 68 percent of Mongolians lived in urban areas, compared to 57 percent in 2000. The population of Ulaanbaatar ballooned by 300,000 since 2000, and now sits at 1.2 million. About 60 percent of the city's population has settled in traditional Mongolian tents called gers, forming massive ger districts —without paved roads, electricity, sanitation, or running water.The researchers analyzed tree rings of Siberian pines, which can live up to a thousand years, to reconstruct a 1,112-year history of soil moisture and climate in Mongolia — one of the longest tree-ring histories on record. More rain means moister soil, which causes trees to grow faster and produce thicker tree rings.Combining their data with previously published tree-ring records, they found that the severity of the recent drought was matched only by dry periods in the late 12th century, which may have contributed to the political instability from which a strong, charismatic leader like Genghis Khan could emerge. The fact that the 21st century has been much warmer than it was in the past means that recent temperature increases likely worsened the drought's impact.The researchers' tree-ring record also revealed a time of unprecedented rainfall between 1211 and 1225, coinciding with the expansion of the Mongolian Empire. While some scholars suggest that droughts pushed the Mongols to invade other lands, this is the first evidence to suggest that rain fueled their conquests.""Contrary to conventional wisdom, the Mongol Empire expanded under a very warm and particularly wet period,"" Hessl said. ""This climate would have benefitted the Mongols by providing them with ample grassland productivity."" This productivity was crucial for providing a consistent energy source for horses and livestock to support armies. To determine that tree-ring data was an accurate representation of grassland productivity, the researchers compared their tree-rings to satellite data of vegetation covering Mongolia between 1980 and 2010. Making this link is important, showing that the evidence isn't simply coincidental, said Valerie Trouet of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who was not part of the research.""This work opens up new trains of thought in terms of what drives human migration and the extension of past empires,"" said Trouet, whose research showed that abrupt climate shifts played a role in the fall of the Roman Empire. For example, she said, one hypothesis is that grassland productivity in central Asia also fueled the Huns, who invaded the Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D. Although modern societies tend to be more resilient against rapid climate shifts, today's Mongolia shows that's not always the case. ""The changes that are ongoing in climate now are very often very abrupt,"" Trouet said. ""And that makes it harder to adapt."" Authorized news sources may reproduce our content.

171	"Monday, February 12, 2018 | Updated at  2:24 PM ETElephants will probably never displace dogs as peoples' best friends, but they apparently can know humans quite well.So say researchers from the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom, who've discovered elephants in Africa are able to identify people who pose a threat by distinguishing between the languages and voices of differing ethnic groups.As described in the March 10 edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers ventured to Amboseli National Park in Kenya, where family groups of elephants were played audio recordings of the Maasai people, who periodically confront elephants over access to water and grazing areas for their cattle, and the Kamba, whose largely agricultural lifestyle causes fewer conflicts with elephants.Elephants involved in the study were more likely to demonstrate defensive behaviors -- such as grouping together and investigative smelling -- when they heard male Maasai voices, as opposed to male Kamba voices.As well, the elephants showed less defensiveness when listening to the voices of Maasai women and boys, indicating an ability to assess the sex and age of voices when figuring out the most threatening situations.""Recognizing predators and judging the level of threat they pose is a crucial skill for many wild animals,"" Karen McComb, lead author of the study and a mammal communication expert, said in a news release. ""Human predators present a particularly interesting challenge, as different groups of humans can represent dramatically different levels of danger to animals living around them.""Previous studies showed elephant family groups exhibiting greater fear to the scent of garments worn by Maasai men than Kamba men and show heightened states of aggression when shown red clothes that the Maasai typically wear.Graeme Shannon, the study's co-author, noted being able to run threat assessments on sounds, from which an elephant family can can determine the ethnicity, gender and age of a potential predator, has the distinct advantage of serving as an early warning system, particularly if a predator can't be seen.""The human language is rich in acoustic cues. The ability to distinguish between Maasai and Kamba men delivering the same phrase in their own language suggests that elephants can discriminate between different languages,"" Shannon said.

172	"News in Science Tuesday, 11 March 2014 Bianca NogradyABCElephants use human voice cues to determine not only ethnicity of humans, but also finer-scaled differences in gender and age(Source: hardholdt/iStockphoto)Pinpointing predators Elephants are able to distinguish between friendly humans and those more likely to pose a threat, based solely on vocal cues, new research shows.The study, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examines the extent to which African elephants use human voice cues to determine not only ethnicity, but also finer-scaled differences in gender and age.The team of researchers from the UK and Kenya studied 47 different elephant family groups living in the Amboseli National Park.Humans pose the most significant threat, other than lions, to elephants living in this area, but different ethnic groups pose different levels of danger. ""Maasai pastoralists periodically come into contact with elephants over access to water and grazing for their cattle, and this sometimes results in elephants being speared, particularly in retaliation when Maasai lives have been lost,"" write the authors.""In contrast, Kamba men, with more agricultural lifestyles, do not typically pose a significant threat to elephants within the National Park, and where conflict occurs outside over crop raiding, this largely involves male rather than female elephants.""Past research has shown that elephants showed a greater fear reaction to garments worn by Maasai men, and their typically red-coloured fabric, than those worn by the Kamba.In this study, the researchers were able to demonstrate that the elephants could reliably discriminate between ethnic and age groups based on their response to voice recordings from Maasai and Kamba men, women and boys.When the elephants heard the playback of Maasai adult males, they behaved much more defensively, with more investigative smelling, bunching and retreating, than when they heard Kamba voices. They also reacted more strongly to adult males than to adult females or to young male voices. The elephants were even able to distinguish the original sex of the speaker when the voices were digitally altered to resemble the acoustics of the opposite gender.McComb says this kind of resynthesising was sophisticated enough to fool the human ear, but the fact that the elephants could still pick and respond to the original gender of the voice suggested they were using different acoustic cues to characterise the speaker. ""They're very good at making these distinctions, which are very important to them when it comes to ultimately to survival and reproductive success,"" says McComb, professor of animal behaviour and cognition University of Sussex.Another finding from the study is that older matriarch elephants are better at distinguishing the true level of threat and so reacted less to the voices of young Maasai boys than did younger matriarchs.""In our previous work, we had found both in the social domain and when we did experiments with lion playbacks, families with older matriarchs were actually better at pin-pointing the most threatening situations,"" says McComb. The researchers also noted quite different defensive behaviour in this study compared to previous studies involving playbacks of lion roars.""Elephants very rarely attempted to approach when faced with human stimuli; instead, reactions involving defensive bunching, retreats and investigative smelling were much more common,"" the authors wrote.""Whereas an aggressive mobbing response can prove very effective in driving off lions, it is unlikely to success against humans armed with spears and would instead put the family group in great danger.""The authors say the findings should prompt similar studies in other animals that have a long history of co-existence with humans.Tags: endangered-and-protected-species, animals, animal-behaviour, mammalsEmail the editorUse these social-bookmarking links to share Elephants tell human friend from foe by voice.Use this form to email 'Elephants tell human friend from foe by voice' to someone you know:

WASHINGTON -- Dr. Seuss had it right: Horton really does hear a Who. Wild elephants can distinguish between human languages, and they can tell whether a voice comes from a man, woman or boy, a new study says.That's what researchers found when they played recordings of people for elephants in Kenya. Scientists say this is an advanced thinking skill that other animals haven't shown. It lets elephants figure out who is a threat and who isn't.The result shows that while humans are studying elephants, the clever animals are also studying people and drawing on their famed powers of memory, said study author Karen McComb.""Basically they have developed this very rich knowledge of the humans that they share their habitat with,"" said McComb , a professor of animal behavior and cognition at the University of Sussex in England.""Memory is key. They must build up that knowledge somehow.""The study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.It's close but not quite like the Dr. Seuss book, where the empathetic elephant Horton hears something that others can't hear.McComb and colleagues went to Amboseli National Park in Kenya, where hundreds of wild elephants live among humans, sometimes coming in conflict over scarce water. The scientists used voice recordings of Maasai men, who on occasion kill elephants in confrontations over grazing for cattle, and Kamba men, who are less of a threat to the elephants. The recordings contained the same phrase in two different languages: ""Look over there. A group of elephants is coming.""By about a two-to-one margin, the elephants reacted defensively -- retreating and gathering in a bunch -- more to the Maasai language recording because it was associated with the more threatening human tribe, said study co-author Graeme Shannon of Colorado State University.""They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,"" Shannon said. ""They're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge. The only way of doing this is with an exceptionally large brain.""They repeated the experiment with recordings of Maasai men and women. Since women almost never spear elephants, the animals reacted less to the women's voices. The same thing happened when they substituted young boys' voices.""Making this kind of fine distinctions in human voice patterns is quite remarkable,"" said Emory University animal cognition expert Frans de Waal, who was not part of the study.While it shows quite a bit about elephant intelligence and adaptability, it also indicates a problem, said biologist Josh Plotnik, founder of Think Elephants International, a research and advocacy group.""This is both fascinating in that it supports evidence we already have that these animals are behaviorally quite flexible, but also sad because it suggests that the conflict between humans and elephants is growing,"" Plotnik, who was not part of the study, wrote in an email.In yet another experiment McComb and Shannon altered female and male voices, making female voices sound male by lowering their tone and resonance, and males sound female by raising their pitches. Those kinds of changes fool most humans, but the clever elephants weren't tricked, McComb said. They still moved away from the altered male voices and not the altered female voices.

The animals showed more fear when they heard the voices of adult Masai men.   Livestock-herding Masai people do come into conflict with elephants, and this suggests that animals have adapted to specifically listen for and avoid them. The study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Source: BBC NatureWatch how elephants use mud as a sunblockProf Karen McComb and Dr Graeme Shannon from the University of Sussex, who led the study, explained that in previous research they had used similar playback experiments to reveal that elephants could tell - from the sound of a lion's roar - whether the animal was a female or a more dangerous male. Other studies have shown that elephants respond with fear to the scent and even to the red colour of the Masai clothing. ""I've experienced that,"" explained Prof McComb. ""If you give a Masai man a lift in your car, you can see the elephants behave in a different way around you. ""They're much more wary of the car and you see a lot of smelling and listening."" Prof McComb wanted to find out if the animals used their very acute sense of hearing to identify a potential threat from humans. The scientists recorded Masai men, women and children saying, in their own language, ""look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming"". They also recorded Kamba men saying this phrase. While cattle-herding Maasai people often encounter free-ranging elephants, which can result in violent conflict, the Kamba people's more agricultural lifestyle does not generally bring them into aggressive contact with the animals. When the team played recordings of these different voices through a camouflaged loudspeaker, they found that elephant family groups reacted more fearfully in response to the voice of a Masai man, than to a Kamba man's voice - retreating and bunching together defensively.And the adult male Masai voices triggered far more of these defensive reactions than the voices of women or boys.An additional and unexpected finding was that when the researchers changed the pitch and frequency of the voices - making a male Masai voice sound more female - the elephants would still react in the same way as they did to the original recording. ""That suggests they're using completely different cues [to us] in order to attribute gender,"" said Prof McComb. Frans van der Waal from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University, a researcher and the author of several books on animal behaviour, wrote in an accompanying article in PNAS that this finding suggested we had ""much to learn about how elephants make decisions"".He added in an interview with BBC News: ""Making these kinds of fine distinctions in human voice patterns is quite remarkable.""Prof McComb said the research showed that elephants were ""trying to adapt"" to human threats.  ""Humans are undoubtedly the most dangerous and versatile predators the elephants are faced with these days,"" she said.  Prof de Waal added: ""The more we understand about how elephants navigate their physical and social worlds, and how their behaviour continues to adapt to ever-changing threats, the better able we will be to effectively work to protect them in the wild.""

179	"HEALTH AND SCIENCEThese intelligent creatures are even more sophisticated than previously believed when it comes to recognising threats to their survival.African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are the largest land animals on Earth and are considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and illegal hunting for their ivory tusks.Researchers played recordings of human voices for elephants at Amboseli National Park in Kenya to see how they would respond, according to a report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Some of the voices were from local Maasai men, who herd cattle and sometimes come into conflict with elephants over access to water and grazing space. Occasionally, elephants are killed in clashes with Maasai men, and vice-versa.Other recorded voices were from Kamba men, who tend to be farmers or employees of the national park, and rarely represent a danger to elephants.Further voices tested on the elephants included female Maasai speakers and young boys.All were saying the same phrase: “Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming.” The recorded voices were played to hundreds of elephants across 47 family groups during daylight hours.When elephants heard the adult male Maasai voices, they tended to gather together, start investigative smelling with their trunks, and move cautiously away.But when elephants heard adult male Kamba speakers, women or boys, they did not show concern.“The ability to distinguish between Maasai and Kamba men delivering the same phrase in their own language suggests that elephants can discriminate between different languages,” said co-author Graeme Shannon, a visiting fellow in psychology at the University of Sussex.Although that is not the same as understanding what the words mean, it shows that elephants can decipher the more sing-song Maasai language from the Kamba tongue, perhaps based on inflections, use of vowels, and other cues.“It is very sophisticated what the elephants are doing,” said Keith Lindsay, a conservation biologist and member of the scientific advisory committee of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project.“A lot of animals will take flight at just the general threat posed by people, but a smart animal doesn&apos;t do that,” he said, suggesting that the elephants were even capable of recognising intention through human behaviour.“Their response to hearing Maasai men talking was to be alert, to move away, but not to run away in total fear.“It is suggesting that elephants are capable of thinking, [of] recognising that if Maasai men are talking, they are not likely to be hunting, because if they were hunting, they would be quiet.” Elephant groups with older matriarchs in their midst did best at assessing the threat from different speakers, bolstering evidence for the presumed role of learning in the animals&apos; behaviour.The elephants also did not act the same way as they did when recordings of lions were played, as was shown in a previous study. In those scenarios, they bunched together so that juveniles - those most at risk from a lion attack - were in the centre, and moved toward the sounds as if to scare the lion away.AFPHear Caroline Overington and Janet Albrechtsen share their views on everything from feminism and foreign affairs to freedom of speech at a member only panel discussion moderated by Michelle Gunn.6 March, 6pm | 7 March, 6pm | 14 March, 6pmSYD | MEL | BRIS

180	Reuters Staff2 Min ReadBOSTON (Reuters) - The big ears are not just for show. Elephants can tell whether a human poses a threat by listening to his voice and sussing out subtle clues about his age, gender and ethnicity, according to a study released on Monday. Researchers from the University of Sussex and the Amboseli Trust for Elephants played recordings of human voices to wild elephants in Kenya and watched how they reacted. “Our results demonstrate that elephants can reliably discriminate between two different ethnic groups that differ in the level of threat they represent,” the authors said in an article published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study said an elephant herd was more likely to bunch up in a defensive position following playbacks of voices of Maasai people, an East African ethnic group that has hunted elephants for centuries, than other groups. “Moreover, these responses were specific to the sex and age of Maasai presented, with the voices of Maasai women and boys, subcategories that would generally pose little threat, significantly less likely to produce these behavioural responses,” according to the study. The researchers said the findings provided the first proof elephants can distinguish between human voices, and suggested that other animals seeking to avoid hunters may also have developed this skill. “Considering the long history and often pervasive predatory threat associated with humans across the globe, it is likely (this ability) could have been selected for in other cognitively advanced animal species,” it said.

181	"A fascinating new study reveals that African elephants can distinguish people of different ethnic groups after hearing them utter a few sentences. They can also tell the difference between a male, female, adult and a child, in addition to a threatening human voice and a friendly one.""They're using vocal information from another species - us - and they're using that to discern threat,"" says study co-author Graeme Shannon, a behavioral ecologist at Britain's University of Sussex, according to USA Today. ""That takes really advanced cognitive abilities. ... These are subtle differences these elephants are attending to.""The wild elephants can also distinguish between the roar of a single lion and a trio of lions, while older elephants can tell the roar of a male lion from the roar of a female, stated Shannon and co-author Karen McComb of the University of Sussex in England.Researchers conducted the study by playing recordings of people for around 1500 African elephants in Kenya. As a result, scientists found that they have an advanced thinking skill that allows them to figure out who is a threat.""Basically they have developed this very rich knowledge of the humans that they share their habitat with,"" said McComb, a professor of animal behavior and cognition, reports NBC News. ""Memory is key. They must build up that knowledge somehow.""Shannon added that, ""They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills.

Elephants may be listening closer than you think. A new study released Monday from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences says that not only can wild elephants distinguish between different human languages, but they can also differentiate between sex and age.In the study, researchers played recordings of different human voices to elephants in Kenya, where the animals live among humans. They played the phrase: “Look over there. A group of elephants is coming,” in two different languages — one spoken by Maasai men and the other by Kamba men. A majority of the time, the elephants reacted more defensively to the recording of the Maasai men — who more often kill elephants in conflict over water — than the recording of Kamba men.Scientists also played recordings of Maasai men and women, in addition to the voices of children. Voices of the women and children, who rarely attack elephants, elicited fewer reactions from the animals than the men. Even after modulating the voices of each sex to sound like the opposite, the elephants reacted more strongly to the changed voices of men“They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,” Graeme Shannon, co-author of the study, told the AP. “They’re able to acquire quite detailed knowledge. The only way of doing this is with an exceptionally large brain.”

184	Elephants may be known for their memory, but it turns out they’re incredible listeners, too. African elephants who hear human voices can tell people of different sexes, ages and even ethnic groups apart, according to a new study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Such keen ears are necessary when trying to survive in territory marked by human-elephant conflict.African elephants who live in Amboseli National Park in Kenya share land with  the Maasai people, who raise and herd cattle. The two groups sporadically come into conflict over such resources as grazing land and water. Occasionally an elephant will attack cattle or even a human, and Maasai hunters will go spear an elephant in response.But these attacks are random, from an elephant’s perspective — and thus, knowing which human is most likely to attack you is a handy skill.“The elephants can’t predict where the people are going to be because  they range over these large areas, grazing their cattle,” said Graeme Shannon, a behavioral ecologist at Colorado State University who co-led the study. “So the threat is both spatially and temporally very variable -- and so they have to respond appropriately.”Voices offer a rich range of auditory cues, and hearing someone from a distance can also give you a key advantage in the survival game if you know what to listen for. Previous research had already shown that elephants can tell the number and sex of lions based on their roaring, and the scientists wondered if the same were true for the elephants' other major predator, humans.The researchers took a speaker, camouflaged it with a screen woven of palm fronds and placed it about 50 meters away from where they expected wandering elephants to end up. They pre-recorded calls from local villagers, including Maasai men, women, and young boys, saying, “Look, look over there: a group of elephants is coming.”To compare to the Maasai, they also included calls from people known as the Kamba. Since the Kamba are farmers, not cattle herders, and their clearly defined cropland is easy for the elephants to avoid, they generally come into far less conflict with elephants.The scientists sat in a Land Rover about 150 meters way from the speaker, waited for elephant families to wander within earshot, and videotaped their responses to the recorded voices.The experiment took two years to complete, partly because the scientists had to space out the sessions so the elephants wouldn’t become used to the experiment. Sometimes the researchers ran into problems: Occasionally a lion came too close and set off the group’s alarms before the experiment ran.  Once, in the midst of an experiment, Shannon said he accidentally hit “shuffle” on his iPod instead of playing the recorded voices -- and the speaker began blasting the Dire Straits’ 1980s classic “Money for Nothing.” The elephants were not impressed.“They didn’t care at all,” he said. “They took a look at the speaker and wandered off.”Elephants did, however, react with alarm to the voices of Maasai men -- they quickly huddled, protecting the calves, and raised their trunks to sniff the air for any human scent. Recordings from Maasai women or boys didn’t earn anywhere close to that kind of reaction. Neither did the voices of Kamba men.That’s because Maasai men are the ones most likely to hunt an elephant down, the scientists said. Women don’t get involved in hunting, the boys are too young, and the Kamba farmers generally don’t need to compete with elephants for resources.The Kamba men spoke a different language than the Maasai, so it’s likely the elephants were picking up on linguistic cues rather than some underlying, inherited differences in their voices. But the scientists aren’t sure exactly how the elephants could tell the adult male Maasai voices from the women and boys’ voices. When they remixed the men’s voices to sound more like the women’s and vice versa, the animals weren’t fooled. Figuring out that mystery will be the job of future research, Shannon said.African elephants can live well into their 60s, and they’re known to have long memories. And the older matriarchs of these elephant clans seemed to be much better at quickly identifying an adult male Maasai’s voice, Shannon said. Younger female leaders tended to be a little more trigger happy, more likely to sniff the air if they heard a Maasai boy instead of an adult man.So for the elderly females, their pitch-perfect ability to identify dangerous humans was probably a skill learned over long years of survival. When it comes to doing a job well, with elephants as with humans, there’s no replacement for experience.ALSO:Watch: Sharks with cameras record their underwater worldDrowning ants use their own babies to make life raftsReal glass that bends without breaking?

	WASHINGTON -- Dr. Seuss had it right: Horton really does hear a Who. Wild elephants can distinguish between human languages, and they can tell whether a voice comes from a man, woman or boy, a new study says.
	That's what researchers found when they played recordings of people for elephants in Kenya. Scientists say this is an advanced thinking skill that other animals haven't shown. It lets elephants figure out who is a threat and who isn't.
	The result shows that while humans are studying elephants, the clever animals are also studying people and drawing on their famed powers of memory, said study author Karen McComb.
	""Basically they have developed this very rich knowledge of the humans that they share their habitat with,"" said McComb , a professor of animal behaviour and cognition at the University of Sussex in England.
	""Memory is key. They must build up that knowledge somehow.""
	The study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
	It's close but not quite like the Dr. Seuss book, where the empathetic elephant Horton hears something that others can't hear.
	McComb and colleagues went to Amboseli National Park in Kenya, where hundreds of wild elephants live among humans, sometimes coming in conflict over scarce water. The scientists used voice recordings of Maasai men, who on occasion kill elephants in confrontations over grazing for cattle, and Kamba men, who are less of a threat to the elephants. The recordings contained the same phrase in two different languages: ""Look over there. A group of elephants is coming.""
	By about a two-to-one margin, the elephants reacted defensively -- retreating and gathering in a bunch -- more to the Maasai language recording because it was associated with the more threatening human tribe, said study co-author Graeme Shannon of Colorado State University.
	""They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,"" Shannon said. ""They're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge. The only way of doing this is with an exceptionally large brain.""
	They repeated the experiment with recordings of Maasai men and women. Since women almost never spear elephants, the animals reacted less to the women's voices. The same thing happened when they substituted young boys' voices.
	""Making this kind of fine distinctions in human voice patterns is quite remarkable,"" said Emory University animal cognition expert Frans de Waal, who was not part of the study.
	While it shows quite a bit about elephant intelligence and adaptability, it also indicates a problem, said biologist Josh Plotnik, founder of Think Elephants International, a research and advocacy group.
	""This is both fascinating in that it supports evidence we already have that these animals are behaviourally quite flexible, but also sad because it suggests that the conflict between humans and elephants is growing,"" Plotnik, who was not part of the study, wrote in an email.
	In yet another experiment McComb and Shannon altered female and male voices, making female voices sound male by lowering their tone and resonance, and males sound female by raising their pitches. Those kinds of changes fool most humans, but the clever elephants weren't tricked, McComb said. They still moved away from the altered male voices and not the altered female voices.AdvertisementDid you capture some amazing images or video?

Occasionally, elephants are killed in clashes with Maasai men, and vice-versa.Other recorded voices were from Kamba men, who tend to be farmers or employees of the national park, and who rarely represent a danger to elephants.Still other voices tested on the elephants included female Maasai speakers and young boys. All were saying the same phrase: ""Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming.""The recorded voices were played for hundreds of elephants across 47 family groups during daylight hours.When elephants heard the adult male Maasai voices, they tended to gather together, start investigative smelling with their trunks, and move cautiously away.But when elephants heard females, boys, or adult male Kamba speakers, they did not show concern.                         ""The ability to distinguish between Maasai and Kamba men delivering the same phrase in their own language suggests that elephants can discriminate between different languages,"" said co-author Graeme Shannon, a visiting fellow in psychology at the University of Sussex.That is not the same as understanding what the words mean, but still shows that elephants can decipher the more sing-songy Maasai language from the Kamba tongue, perhaps based on inflections, use of vowels, and other cues.""It is very sophisticated what the elephants are doing,"" said Keith Lindsay, a conservation biologist and member of the scientific advisory committee of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project.""A lot of animals will take flight at just the general threat posed by people, but a smart animal doesn't do that,"" he told AFP.""Their response to hearing Maasai men talking was to be alert, to move away, but not to run away in total fear,"" added Lindsay, who was not involved in the study.""It is suggesting that elephants are capable of thinking, (of) recognising that if Maasai men are talking, they are not likely to be hunting because if they were hunting, they would be quiet.""                          Elephant groups with older matriarchs in their midst did best at assessing the threat from different speakers, further bolstering the presumed role of learning in the animals' behaviour. The elephants also did not act the same way as they did when recordings of lions were played, as was shown in a previous study. In those scenarios, they bunched together so that juveniles - those most at risk from a lion attack - were in the centre, and moved toward the sounds as if to scare the lion away. When it comes to recognising people, elephants may not be alone in this ability. Other research has suggested that wild bottlenose dolphins in Brazil have become so familiar with humans that they engage in cooperative hunting with artisanal fisherman.Great apes, crows and even prairie dogs have also been shown to differentiate between humans on some level.A separate study published last month in the journal PLoS ONE showed elephants even have specific alarm calls for when humans are near, suggesting the relationship between people and elephants has reached a troubling point and that conservation efforts are more important than ever.""We have become a formal enemy of the elephants,"" said Lori Marino, an expert on animal intelligence at Emory University.""They can not only make some distinctions between us, but we are now on their list of species to watch out for."" AFP01 March 2014South African officials are battling to protect rhinos from poachers, but it seems they're not the only species in the firing line. 02 December 2013Africa could lose 20 percent of its elephant population in a decade if current poaching levels are not slowed.23 October 2013A veteran game ranger was killed after elephants attacked him when he stepped out of his patrol base in Zimbabwe's largest game reserve.Data delayed by at least 15 minutes.Data delayed by at least 15 minutes.Data delayed by at least 15 minutes."

Not only could the African elephants (stock image) tell the two languages apart, they could also work out if the speaker was a man or a woman and an adult or a child This is despite the recordings being just a few seconds long.The researchers, including conservationist Cynthia Moss, believe the creatures use voice and language to help them work out which humans pose a threat to them.They can then choose whether to defend themselves against attack or continue going about life as usual.The researchers began my making recordings of members of two Kenyan tribes repeating the phrase ‘Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming’.One tribe was the Massai, who historically killed elephants as a rite of passage on entering adulthood. They also take revenge when elephants kill their cattle.The researchers began my making recordings of members of two Kenyan tribes repeating the phrase 'Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming'. One tribe was the Massai, (pictured) who historically killed elephants as a rite of passage on entering adulthood The second was the Kamba, who farm crops and have a more amicable relationship with the elephants.The tapes were then played through loudspeakers to groups of elephants in the Amboseli National Park in Kenya and their reactions noted.The animals were clearly more scared of the Massai and bunched together defensively on hearing them speak.They also used their trunks to sniff at the air on hearing a Massai voice, likely in an attempt to pick up smells that would provide more information about the intruder.As the same phrase was used in all the recordings and it was spoken in the same way each time, it is believed the animals were able to tell the two languages apart.Their skill didn’t end there. The elephants were also more likely to act defensively on hearing a male Massai than female. They were also more likely to retreat on hearing a grown man than a boy. Elephants grieve like humans and are believed to suffer from post traumatic stress Grieving: Elephants grieve like humans, shedding tears and taking part in rituals to 'bury' bodies. And the damaging effects of grief from death - especially of a parent - stay with them for decades, according to recent research at the University of Sussex. The study has found that African elephants who were orphaned by a cull in Kruger National Park in the 1970s and 1980s are still suffering post-traumatic stress.Singing: The large creatures use an ultrasound rumble - often too low for humans to hear - to keep a herd together and for males to find mates. By doing this, they can communicate six miles awaySneaking: Elephants carry out raids on crops when the nights are the darkest and scientists have found that their foraging expeditions in Africa tend to vary with the lunar cycle.Fewer raids take place during a full moon when farmers are more likely to spot the animals plundering their crops. It is thought that elephants deliberately alter their behaviour to reduce the risks of encountering humans.Remembering: Older elephants remember dangerous situations and are able to best make crucial decisions about predators, based on their previous perilous experiences. When scientists played families lion roars from a loudspeaker, those with older matriarchs correctly focused their defensive reactions on male lions that are the most adept killers.Pointing: A study published last year found that jungle elephants instinctively known what pointing means - and are the only animal capable of this feat. Professor Richard Byrne from St Andrews University said: ‘What elephants share with humans is that they live in an elaborate and complex network in which support, empathy, and help for others are critical for survival.’

193	" In the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro in Kenya’s Amboseli National Park, encounters between humans and elephants are occurring more frequently as civilization encroaches on the few remaining wildlife habitats. Sometimes, these encounters have violent consequences.But elephants are savvy creatures, and they’ve learned to differentiate human threats by simply listening. Elephants are such good listeners, researchers recently discovered, that they can distinguish ethnicity, age and sex from subtle clues in human voices. The study was the first to test whether elephants can detect danger from clues in human voices.The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrate the advanced intelligence of these large-brained mammals.Elephants roaming the Amboseli will generally encounter people from either the Maasai or Kamba ethnic groups. The Kamba live a predominantly agricultural lifestyle and rarely clash with elephants. Maasai, on the other hand, raise livestock and often battle elephants for access to grazing land and water.Knowing that bad blood exists between elephants and the Maasai, researchers recorded voices of Maasai and Kamba males saying “Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming” in their own languages. They also recorded the voices of Maasai women and children saying the same thing. Then, they followed approximately 58 elephant families and played the voices to test elephants’ responses.When researchers played a Maasai male voice, elephants immediately started sniffing the air for danger and retreated into a bunched, defensive formation. By contrast, the elephants were unfazed by the Kamba male voice. Further, elephants didn’t seem to mind the voices of Maasai women and children.Even when researchers re-synthesized the Maasai male voice so it resembled a female’s, the elephants still recognized it was male and acted defensively. The results indicate that elephants can pick up even the subtlest vocal cues to assess the level of a threat.Quickly determining the threat level of an approaching animal or human is very important for survival. Unnecessarily retreating from harmless people and animals is detrimental to the health of an elephant family group. Constantly running from things that are harmless consumes a lot of energy and it’s just plain stressful. Therefore, elephants need to intelligently decide when to run and when to stay put.This study is the first to show detailed human voice discrimination in a wild population of large-brained, long-lived mammals. The findings suggest that mammals with the mental power of elephants can distinguish between subsets of human predators. Researchers hope future studies will examine whether the same abilities are present in other intelligent animals.In this video, elephants retreat to a defensive position after hearing the recorded voice of a Maasai male.Photo credit:  E.

Researchers have discovered that African elephants can distinguish different people groups and gauge whether or not the humans are dangerous just from hearing them talk.Working with around 1,500 elephants roaming Kenya's Amboseli National Park, the researchers found that elephants can tell if a human voice is male or female and if it belongs to a child or an adult, USA TODAY reported.""They're using vocal information from another species--us--and they're using that to discern a threat,"" said study co-author Graeme Shannon, a behavioral ecologist at Britain's University of Sussex, as quoted by USA TODAY. ""That takes really advanced cognitive abilities. ... These are subtle differences these elephants are attending to.""The elephants used in the study live near two groups of people: the Maasi, who used to spear elephants frequently and now attack the animals on occasion, and the Kamba, peaceful farmers who aren't a threat.To test whether the elephants could tell the different ethnic groups apart, the scientists disguised loudspeakers with palm leaves and put them near a herd. The speakers played a human voice saying, ""Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming,"" and the elephants reacted in different ways depending on the voice.The recording of a Masaai man put the elephants on alert; they bunched together and smelled the air, waiting for a possible attack. But they had little reaction to a Kamba man or women and children from either people group, who didn't historically pose a threat.The scientists then further tested the animals' ability to distinguish voices by toying with the recording of a Masaai man's voice to sound higher and more like a woman's. The elephants still reacted as if the voice hadn't been altered, which implies that ""they are picking up gender signals more accurate than those used by humans,"" USA TODAY reported. 2018 BMW 520i And 525d Specs Reveal Four-Cylinder Engine & 6.6-Second Acceleration Rate2018 Mercedes-Benz S Class To Offer A New Kind Of Mobile Yoga System?Dallara’s New Sports CarIs Coming Out Soon!

197	"Friend or foe? Elephants run from the voices of Maasai men, such as this herder (top).(Top) Graeme Shannon; (Bottom) Karen McComb
  By Virginia MorellMar. 10, 2014 , 3:15 PMWhether we realize it, African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are listening to us. The pachyderms can tell certain human languages apart and even determine our gender, relative age, and whether we’re a threat, according to a new study. The work illustrates how elephants can sometimes protect themselves from human actions.“It is a most remarkable finding,” says Frans de Waal, a primatologist at Emory University in Atlanta. “Animals associating sounds with danger is nothing new—but making these fine distinctions in human voices is quite remarkable.”Elephants in Kenya’s Amboseli National Park, where the study took place, are killed periodically by Maasai pastoralists. Maasai men sometimes spear the animals to protest park policies   governing grazing and water rights, and sometimes in retaliation for tusking and trampling people or cattle. “Most of the time, the Maasai and elephants co-exist quite well,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom. “But spearings do occur, and it’s clear that the elephants are tuned into the Maasai in lots of ways.”It’s long been known that elephants flee when they encounter Maasai men wearing their distinctive red robes—yet they are far less bothered by other people on foot. Indeed, other studies have shown that the animals even distinguish between the color and scent of clothing worn by Maasai pastoralists and Kamba men, farmers who live in the same area but don’t threaten the animals.McComb and her colleagues wondered if the Amboseli elephants could make similar distinctions between the voices of the Maasai and Kamba people. The scientists recorded men from the two ethnic groups, as well as Maasai women and boys, saying “Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming” in their respective languages. (A Maasai man speaks the phrase in the audio file above.) From a concealed loudspeaker, the team then played back the voice recordings to 47 elephant family groups (which are composed of related adult females and their dependent young) while observing and videotaping the animals’ reactions.Right “from the get-go, the elephants responded differently to the Maasai and Kamba male voices,” says study co-author Graeme Shannon, a behavioral ecologist at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. They were more likely to retreat and bunch together, forming a defensive fortress around their young, and to smell the air (raising their trunks skyward) if they heard an adult Maasai man speak. But their reaction was not nearly as defensive when the voice was that of a male Kamba. The animals were also much less fearful when presented with the voices of Maasai women or boys. The scientists also altered the recordings, making the adult male voices sound more female and vice versa. But the elephants weren’t fooled and remained vigilant, the scientists report online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.“Cognitively, they know what they’re doing, and they adjust their reaction to exactly what they’re hearing,” McComb says. In a previous playback experiment, she and her colleagues showed that elephants will often come aggressively toward the loudspeaker when they hear lions (their other predator) roaring, apparently to drive them off. But when the elephants heard the adult Maasai male voices, they never showed this mobbing behavior, and instead formed a defensive bunch and retreated stealthily.And apparently because the Maasai men present such a serious threat, all the elephant matriarchs, including the youngest, knew how best to respond, the researchers say. “It’s a key skill,” Shannon says, “and is learned by watching; it’s likely not hardwired.” McComb adds that “older matriarchs appeared better at some voice discriminations—in particular, telling the difference between Maasai men and boys so that they only retreated when faced with men’s voices.”“This study is one more confirmation of just how intelligent and flexible elephants are,” says Joyce Poole, an elephant expert with ElephantVoices in the Maasai Mara in Kenya. “I routinely tell the Maasai I work with that the elephants are studying us more carefully than we are studying them.” The work may be helpful in preventing “human-elephant conflicts where the species co-exist,” adds Joshua Plotnik, a behavioral ecologist at Mahidol University, Kanchanaburi, in Thailand. For instance, elephants might be deterred from entering farmland or encouraged to stick to the corridors designed for their use, Poole says. “The trouble is elephants are too smart to be fooled by us for long.”Conservationists are also unlikely to be able to use the elephants’ language discerning abilities to stop the poachers armed with machine guns. “The elephants have learned what to do about Maasai men,” Shannon says. “But the Maasai spear only one elephant. Poachers gun down entire families. There’s little elephants can do about that.”

199	"To most people, elephants sound the same. Unless, you’re very experienced, it would be hard to tell the difference between two elephants based solely on their voices. They, however, have no such problems with us.Karen McComb and Graeme Shannon from the University of Sussex have now shown that wild African elephants can tell the difference between the voices of humans from two ethnic groups, and react accordingly. They can even discriminate between the sounds of men and women, and adults and boys.This ability matters because, to an elephant, not all humans are equal. They have no quarrel with the agriculturalist Kamba. But they often come into conflict with the cattle-herding Maasai over access to water or land, and they sometimes leave these clashes with a flank full of spears.Back in 2009, Lucy Bates and Richard Byrne from the University of St Andrews showed that elephants at Kenya’s Amboseli National Park can distinguish between the smell of Maasai and Kamba clothes. If they sniffed eau de Maasai, they were more likely to flee into long grass. They behaved in the same way if they saw the distinctive red colour of Maasai clothes. McComb and Shannon’s study is a sequel of sorts. They showed that elephants can rely on sounds as well as smells to assess the threats they face.The team recorded 20 Maasai and 15 Kamba saying “Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming” in their respective languages. They then played these recordings to 48 family groups of Amboseli elephants. The herds obviously couldn’t understand the meaning of the words, but they could tell the difference between the two languages. When they heard the Massai voices, they were much more likely to bunch up into defensive clusters and sniff the air with their trunks. They knew which group was more dangerous.They also seemed to know which people within the groups pose the greatest threat: they behaved defensively when they heard Maasai men rather than women, and adults rather than boys. “I don’t find this at all surprising, since voice pitch alone enables that distinction,” says Byrne. “But the details that differ between Maasai and Kamba languages are presumably more subtle.”But when McComb and Shannon altered the Maasai recordings so that the male and female voices had the same pitch, the elephants could still tell them apart. They must have been picking up on some features that are subtler than mere frequency.Still, that’s not surprising. Elephants are big-brained and extremely intelligent. They communicate with a wide range of sounds. They are long-lived, so they can build up a substantial lifetime of experience, and they live in tightly knit social groups, so youngsters can benefit from the knowledge of their elders. “The surprising thing was just how clued up they were,” says McComb. “They were really able to make these distinctions very well and they rarely got it wrong.”They can also tailor their responses to different predators. Their main threats are humans and lions. In an earlier study, McComb and Shannon found that elephants can tell the difference between the roars of male and female lions. They react to these roars by forming defensive circles and then noisily mobbing the source of the sound. (Watch them react below.)But when they heard the Maasai voices, they were much less aggressive. “Coming towards humans with spears would be very detrimental,” McComb deadpans. “They behaved as if they were expecting to see Maasai.” They also went into stealth mode; they only made audible noises 10 percent of the time after hearing Maasai speech, compared to 67 percent after hearing lion roars.In a related study, Joseph Soltis, who works at Disney’s Animal Kingdom, found that elephants react differently to two distinct threats: talking humans and buzzing bees. Bees can sting elephants in vulnerable places like their eyes or inside their trunks, and elephants are so scared of this that they’ll flee if they hear buzzing.Soltis’ team showed that Kenyan herds make distinct alarm calls when they hear either humans or bees, and they can modify the tempo and pitch of the calls to show how urgent the threats are. They also react accordingly. When the researchers played the calls back to the elephants, they found that both alarms would prompt the herds to keep watch and run away. But the bee alarm specifically makes them shake their heads, presumably to knock away any nearby stings.These studies are testament to the keen intelligence, rich social lives, and sophisticated communications of these largest of land animals. As Ferris Jabr beautifully writes, “To look an elephant in the face is to gaze upon genius.”But the results also speak to the sad history of conflicts between humans and elephants. These conflicts must have played out many times over for the animals to build up enough experience about which humans are the most dangerous.“The level of spearing has gone down quite considerably in recent years,” says McComb. The Maasai are now partners in Amboseli National Park. They also get compensated if elephants accidentally kill their livestock, which stops them from spearing the animals in retaliation. Still, the sound of Maasai still sets them on edge. This suggests that once at least some members of the family have a bad run-in with humans, the others learn from her and the fear stays in the group.Still, McComb adds that “elephants are very good at living alongside humans by avoiding dangerous situations. But when we start doing something dramatically different, like a huge increase in poaching or using automatic weapons, they can’t adapt fast enough. That’s when we need to step in and protect them.”Fritz Vollrath from Oxford University, who was involved in the bee study, adds, “Knowing how elephants perceive their social and physical environments and how the communicate their perceptions between one another will allow us to not only better understand them but also to better protect them in the wild.”References: McComb, Shannon, Sayialel & Moss. 2014.

201	"Enid Burns for redOrbit.com - Your Universe OnlineBitcoin exchange Mt. Gox continues to suffer damages, but the most recent accusations after the company claimed $400 million worth of the currency was lost last month may this time be self-inflicted. Hackers claim to have accessed the company's records and say Mt. Gox may have actually pocketed the cash and show other evidence of fraud.""On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. 'It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,' wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be 'goxed'–to suffer from Mt. Gox’s technical glitches,"" Forbes' Andy Greenberg wrote.Hackers supplied some evidence with their accusations. The post on Karpeles' personal website contained a 716 megabyte file that the hackers claimed comprised stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers. The file includes an Excel spreadsheet that details over a million trades, ""a file that purports to show the company’s balances in eighteen difference currencies, the backoffice application for some sort of administrative access to the databases of Mt. Gox’s parent company Tibanne Limited, a screenshot of the hackers’ access to those databases, a list of Mark Karpeles’ home addresses and Karpeles’ personal CV,"" Forbes reports.It is not advisable to actually access the files posted by the hackers. Forbes updated its report to say that users on Reddit warn that the files ""may contain malware designed to steal bitcoins."" Other users on Reddit confirmed that the data are not fake as they found details of their own account history in the files.The hackers claim that a balance of 951,116 bitcoins in Mt. Gox's balance is a portion of what Karpeles claims was lost to hackers from user accounts.The hacking and posting of Mt. Gox information apparently occurred after frustration of Mt. Gox's silence after bitcoin currency in user accounts was stolen last month when a vulnerability was exploited. One company, AU10TIX, found that the crash occurred due to inadequate ID authentication practices.One vocal victim of the theft last month was the black market site Silk Road, which claims to have lost 4,400 bitcoins worth roughly $2.6 million."

205	MyBroadband – Trusted in TechMt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.“This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.”Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.“We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners.The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.The case is Mt.

208	The collapse of Japan's Mt Gox bitcoin exchange is spilling into US bankruptcy court as the company scrambles for legal cover after losing digital currency valued at $US473 million ($A526.02 million).Mt Gox's bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday supplements a similar petition made in Japan late last month following the exchange's abrupt closure. The US case is being brought under Chapter 15 of the country's bankruptcy code, which provides a haven for foreign companies seeking to re-organise their finances.Mt Gox's downfall provided fresh ammunition for bitcoin sceptics who have questioned the security and staying power of a digital currency created six years ago as an alternative to government-controlled monetary systems that rely on banks to process most transactions.Once the world's largest exchange specialising in bitcoins, Mt Gox is now mired in a financial mess. The exchange froze its users' accounts last month and then shut down after acknowledging it couldn't account for 850,000 bitcoins. Mt Gox chief executive Robert Karpeles blamed most of the losses on computer hackers who took advantage of the exchange's flawed software.The missing currency, valued at $US473 million at the time of Mt Gox's February 28 bankruptcy filing in Japan, represents about seven per cent of all bitcoins in worldwide circulation, according to court documents.Although it's based in Tokyo, Mt Gox is opening a US bankruptcy case in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in the state of Illinois on behalf of all US residents burned by the exchange's demise.The civil complaint brought against Mt Gox by Illinois resident Gregory Greene alleges the exchange engaged in fraud and other misconduct. The suit is seeking to be certified as a class action that would represent all US residents who had paid fees to Mt Gox as part of a bitcoin trade or had their accounts frozen.Steven Woodrow, a Denver lawyer representing Greene, estimates hundreds of thousands of people could be represented in the case.In a Monday interview, Woodrow said he still intends to seek a federal court order that would freeze Mt Gox's computers and other assets in the US.If the Illinois case proceeds, Mt Gox lawyers contend that it will drain the company's finances and divert management's attention during a critical time.Mt Gox's bankruptcy papers list liabilities of about $US64 million and assets of $US38 million.Mt Gox also hopes to use US bankruptcy laws to ward off another lawsuit filed last year in a Seattle federal court by a former US partner, CoinLab Action.Under an agreement signed in November 2012, CoinLab was supposed to use Mt Gox's technology to run a bitcoin exchange in the US and Canada. The alliance unravelled within a few months, prompting CoinLab to sue Mt Gox for alleged breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking $US75 million in damages, according to court documents.	Science

GOLDMINE: Mark Karpeles, chief executive of Mt Gox, attends a news conference at the Tokyo District Court.Mt Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, has received US bankruptcy protection to temporarily halt US legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt Gox's US-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt Gox's assets. Mt Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.""This case involves a massive fraud,"" said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. ""They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr Karpeles. Respectfully, your honour, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.""Mt Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.An attorney for Coinlab, which sued Mt Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behaviour by Karpeles in the days leading up the US bankruptcy filing.""We don't have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr Karpeles,"" said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.Mt Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt Gox to ask the US Bankruptcy Court to recognise its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its US-based assets.Hale's order protects Mt Gox's US assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt Gox will seek a permanent stay of US litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all US residents who paid a trading fee to Mt Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.Mt Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of US$75 million from Mt Gox.Mt Gox's tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue US law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies' owners.The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company's true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies' activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a US bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means ""worthless little symbol"" in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sentor Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver's license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

Embattled Bitcoin exchange site MtGox has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States under Chapter 15 of the American bankruptcy code, which is designed to aid cases where there are “debtors, assets, claimants, and other parties of interest involving more than one country.”Further ReadingAnonymous hackers uncover alleged proof of MtGox fraud from site’s CEOThe site previously filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, where its corporate offices are, at the end of February 2014. According to court documents filed in federal court in Dallas late Sunday, CEO Mark Karpeles told the court that the company has approximately $63.9 million in liabilities and approximately $37.7 million in assets.In the filing, Karpeles also mentioned that the company “lost” 744,408 bitcoins (around $463 million at present) due to a “defect or ‘bug’ in the Bitcoin software algorithm being exploited by one or more persons who ‘hacked’ the Bitcoin network.” He also said that the loss, combined with an additional loss of around 100,000 of the company’s own bitcoins, constituted “around seven percent of all bitcoins in the world.”Karpeles did not respond to Ars’ request for comment.The CEO’s declaration asks the American court to “allow MtGox a necessary breathing period for it to focus on its restructuring efforts without the distraction that would result if certain litigation currently pending in the United States were allowed to proceed.”Further ReadingIllinois man files class-action lawsuit against Bitcoin exchange MtGoxThe French-born executive added that “when the Tokyo Court issues its final order approving MtGox’s reorganization plan, I will seek this Court’s assistance in enforcing such final order.”Another court document filed by California attorney Tod Gamlen, who is representing MtGox in a suit filed against it by CoinLab from 2013, asks for a stay in that case. The Gamlen Declaration notes that Karpeles is set to be deposed later this month in Taiwan. Gamlen also asked that the class-action suit filed against MtGox last month be temporarily put on hold. The attorney did not respond to Ars' request for comment.On Saturday, a new document posted to the MtGox website warned (PDF) of phishing e-mails that ask for usernames, passwords, and banking details.You must login or create an account to comment."

213	"Former Macquarie banker Joe Lee and Wall Street investment adviser George Samman suspected something was wrong with Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox in the closing months of 2013.The founders behind Singapore-based derivatives trader BTC.sx had begun withdrawing money as early as December, fearing the premium Mt.Gox users paid for Bitcoins was a sign of liquidity issues at the Tokyo-based exchange.'The money was essentially frozen"": Karl Kloppenborg, 22,  lost $47,000 in the Mt.Gox collapse.But it didn't stop Lee and Samman from sustaining a six-figure loss when Mt.Gox finally went under last month.""We were one of Mt.Gox's biggest customers but we got no inside ­information from them at all,"" says ­Samman, chief operating officer at the trader. ""They couldn't answer any questions so it was useless. We were lucky to get off what we needed to get off before the whole thing went down.""In Melbourne, 22-year-old Bitcoin trader Karl Kloppenborg was also burned by the fall of Mt.Gox.An IT entrepreneur who is building his own Bitcoin exchange, Kloppenborg lost $47,000 in the collapse.""I realised something was wrong much earlier on – I threatened legal action, and said I'd call the banks,"" he says. ""It became a waiting game when I realised that the money was essentially frozen.""Series of Bitcoin problemsThe failure of Bitcoin's most public face is just one in a series of hiccups for the fast-rising virtual currency, after raids on online black market SilkRoad, which dealt solely in Bitcoins, and the purported unmasking of Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto (later denied by Nakamoto).For a mathematical code which has seen its value rise from several US ­dollars to the thousands in just five years – to be worth $US10 billion ($11.1 billion) at its height – the loss of 744,000 Bitcoins (worth $527 million at Monday's average exchange rate) was no doubt a shock to Bitcoin users, many of whom dedicated their trust to the service.And the community is no doubt outraged. Despite statements from Mt.Gox that the loss was a theft, resulting from flaws in the system's code, those demanding vigilante justice have attacked the online accounts of Mt.Gox's former chief Mark Karpeles, publishing his personal information and the purported bank balance of the company in 18 different currencies, including nearly $A1 million.The information has fuelled speculation that Mt.Gox's collapse is more fraud than theft, but provides ­little hope that users will have their Bitcoins returned.In an email trail seen by The Australian Financial Review between ­Kloppenborg and Mt.Gox staff, the exchange admitted it was unable to process ­Bitcoin withdrawals quickly due to difficulty dealing with major banks.It's a problem that Bitcoin trader David Parrish says needs to be fixed.""It's still quite difficult to buy ­Bitcoins,"" says Parrish, a software en­gineer at Google Australia. Instead of transferring money through online exchanges, Parrish buys and sells ­Bitcoins by physically meeting with like-minded traders.Average price steadyHowever, despite a seemingly catastrophic blow to a burgeoning system, Mt.Gox's failure appeared to expose just how little an effect one exchange could have on the global system. Though Mt.Gox's own price collapsed from $US1209 to $US122 shortly before bankruptcy, the average price in the wider market has managed to sustain a $500 average since its collapse, and even risen slightly in recent weeks. Its price remains volatile but it seems those committed to Bitcoin are sticking with it. ""People have been looking for reasons to not trust Bitcoin,"" says ­Samman. ""But I think it's a short-term negative and long-term positive.""You get rid of a bad player which was actually becoming detrimental to the liquidity of Bitcoin itself. It will cause people to want to have more regulation than they have in the past.""Governments globally have salivated over the prospect of regulating the currency. Russia has banned ­Bitcoin while China has restricted how banks play with the currency. Japan is contemplating rules as regulators in New York float the idea of a ­Bitcoin licence.No plans for Australian regulationsIn Australia, however, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens told a parliamentary committee on Friday that he was ""not inclined to feel that we have to rush in as a regulator"".""We have seen some pretty substantial losses incurred by Bitcoin holders in a couple of jurisdictions just in recent weeks,"" he said. ""It is a potential alternative currency so how it will hold its value is the first question. There have been countless currencies through history and the ones that survive are the ones that hold value.""Samman says BTC.sx will join the list of 127,000 creditors seeking retribution from Mt.Gox but is unsure how regulators will even tackle a corporation that deals in assets that countries do not yet recognise.""They probably will have to tread on very careful water, the judges or whoever is involved in this bankruptcy because if they frame it in a certain way they may get a legal precedent for the legitimacy of Bitcoin,"" he says.Delivered Mon–Fri.By signing up you accept our privacy policy and conditions of useCopyright © 2018"	Science

Gox’s bankruptcy papers list liabilities of about $64 million and assets of $38 million.Meanwhile, those who are still enthusiasts of the digital currency have donated about $28,000 to Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old physicist who denied a report last week by Newsweek magazine that identified him as bitcoin’s creator.A wallet address set up by Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for Blockchain.info, received more than 1,800 payments, amounting to about 44 bitcoins, according to data on his company’s website. That compares with about 1 million coins that the founder of the system owns, worth over $1 billion when the price peaked in December, according to Jered Kenna, a San Francisco-based Bitcoin investor.The naming of Dorian Nakamoto drew media attention that resulted in the former defence industry and government employee being chased by reporters through Los Angeles. Bitcoin supporters expressed outrage at what they saw as a violation of his privacy and further evidence of news media bias against the nascent digital currency that last month suffered the collapse of one of its largest exchanges.“If this person is not Satoshi, then these funds will serve as a ‘sorry for what happened to you’,” Antonopoulos wrote in a post on the Reddit social media website on Saturday. Bitcoin’s cryptographic origins resulted in anonymity being built into the payment protocol and a community that prizes privacy. These same features prompted regulators worldwide to express concern the digital currency may be used for money-laundering and illicit sales, such as the online Silk Road website where customers used coins to buy and sell drugs.Satoshi Nakamoto has been thought to be a pseudonym for a programmer or group of programmers who wrote the paper and the initial source code for Bitcoin. The code has since been handed off to a loose group of experts affiliated with the Bitcoin Foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group.Do you want to help shapethe Toronto Star's future?Join our team of readers who are passionate about journalism and share your views.         Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

218	Reuters Staff7 Min Read* Objectors allege Mt. Gox’s U.S. bankruptcy part of a fraud * Opponents said Karpeles recently moved millions of dollars of bitcoins * Case may revive criticisms of U.S. shell corporations By Tom Hals March 10 (Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud. Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers. The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets. Mt. Gox’s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit. The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse. “This case involves a massive fraud,” said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. “They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.” Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency. An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing. “We don’t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,” said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper. Mt. Gox’s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding. The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. Hale’s order protects Mt. Gox’s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles. Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7. Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted. Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mt Gox’s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies’ owners. The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company’s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies’ activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company. Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means “worthless little symbol” in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States. It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations. Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French. When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking. He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing. Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight. The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup. The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver’s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary. The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

219	If you consider emoji a language, then it is the fastest-growing language in the world bit.ly/2o1p0cmThe Mt. Gox death spiral continues. The big-name bitcoin exchange has now filed for bankruptcy protection here in the U.S., as well as Japan, and hackers are saying they’ve uncovered evidence of fraud at the Tokyo-based company, after allegedly breaking into a website controlled by its CEO.Mt. Gox was once the most popular site for buying and selling the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin. But The Wall Street Journal. Mt. Gox is facing a class-action lawsuit filed in Illinois, and it has long been involved in a $75 million lawsuit with another bitcoin company, called CoinLab.The ongoing travails of Mt. Gox act as a metaphor for the bitcoin world as a whole. Though the digital currency is beginning to remake the way the world moves and stores money, many of the companies and individuals that first pushed the technology into the mainstream are now struggling to come to terms with government regulations and the realities of doing business.At a press conference last month, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles admitted that the company lost around 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins — worth around half a billion dollars. He blamed a known issue in the bitcoin protocol that enabled hackers to trick the company’s software into thinking transactions failed. Apparently, Gox’s accounting software didn’t deal with this flaw and could be tricked to send repeated bitcoin payouts to the same customers.How Mt. Gox could have lost so many bitcoins without noticing remains a matter of speculation, and many suspect foul play on the company’s part, not just mere incompetence. Among them are the hackers that hijacked Karpeles’ personal website and published a file they claim contains data acquired from the company’s servers. Included in the file was an Excel spreadsheet showing a balance of 951,116 bitcoins.The hackers, who also hijacked Karpeles’ Reddit account, claim the document proves that Mt. Gox is still in control of those bitcoins. But given Mt. Gox’s claim that the bitcoins were stolen without anyone at the company noticing, it would make sense that the company’s official balance sheets still show a much larger number of bitcoins. Ultimately, even if the document is authentic, it proves nothing one way or the other.Many Reddit users claim to have found their own transaction data in the spreadsheet, suggesting that the materials are authentic. But Forbes reporter Andy Greenberg warns that the zip file may contain malware designed to steal bitcoins — and cautions people not to download the file. Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox responded to a request for comment about the spreadsheet’s origins or authenticity.The alleged hack follows a number of other leaks and hacks from the company, including a leaked internal document about the missing bitcoins and supposed copies of the code used to run the exchange. Meanwhile, Bitcoin users are dealing with the bankruptcy in their own way: by creating a new currency to buy and sell rights to the lost bitcoins, should they ever be recovered.If you consider emoji a language, then it is the fastest-growing language in the world bit.ly/2o1p0cmIf you consider emoji a language, then it is the fastest-growing language in the world bit.ly/2o1p0cmWe get it: Ads aren’t what you’re here for.

The drama surrounding Mt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, has intensified.The company on Sunday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States -- less than two weeks after taking a similar action in Tokyo, where it's headquartered.It apparently made this move to freeze a lawsuit initiated in a federal court in Chicago by a customer seeking US$25,000-worth of bitcoins and class action status.Also on Sunday, hackers broke into the blog and Reddit account of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and published data 
purporting to show that Mt. Gox then had access to nearly 1 million bitcoins, and that there was a difference of about 500,000 Bitcoins between the firm's deposits and withdrawals.A PDF posted last week on the 
Mt. Gox website warns that cybercriminals are emailing btcoin owners asking for their personal details and bank account numbers, purportedly to notify creditors of their claims.

The hackers who published Mt. Gox's files online are in effect accusing the company or CEO Karpeles of having stolen the bitcoins in its coffers.Another 
possibility was proposed by Adam Levine and other researchers late last month, just two days before Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo.They raised the possibility that the Bitcoins were lost because of incompetence, and pointed out that Mt. Gox had, in effect, played a shell game in 2011, moving more than 400,000 Bitcoins from one account to another to assuage concerns about its solvency at the time.Either Karpeles or Mt. Gox controls 90,000 Bitcoins unspent since 2011, the researchers contended,  noting that ""either the numbers on the Mt. Gox crisis 
strategy draft are wrong ... or something else is afoot.""That doesn't rule out the possibility of 
transaction malleability, the researchers said.


 
""Either possibility could be true, and only an in-depth audit will showcase the truth,"" Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, told the E-Commerce Times.Although Bitcoin was set up to provide anonymity, a number of algorithms have been created that can trace transactions back to the people who made them, Enderle pointed out. However, it isn't so easy to track the person who actually holds the bitcoins.""There have been a number of bitcoin thefts, and I'm not aware of any major arrests, so there's a chance [Karpeles] could get away with this, even with scrutiny,"" Enderle remarked. ""The thieves are getting more creative as well, in order to conceal their thefts.""


 
""I saw this train wreck coming from the start,"" Jim McGregor, founder and principal analyst at Tirias Research, told the E-Commerce Times. ""For anyone who thinks this is a cool thing with no government involvement, I've got news for you -- somebody was looking to make money off this thing.""Still, Bitcoin exchanges have rallied around the virtual currency, and interest in it appears to be growing.There apparently was a Bitcoin ATM at the South by Southwest Interactive trade show in Austin, Texas, and at least three companies make ATMs for bitcoins. There reportedly are four Bitcoin ATMs in Austin, and four in the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Edmonton.Coindesk, which carries news about Bitcoin and the exchange rates for the currency, reports that a new patent shows Bitcoin has been part of eBay's planning since 2011.Still, economist Nouriel Roubini, better known as ""Dr. Doom,"" 
has tweeted that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.Consumers ""can't trust a currency that goes through valuation swings like this,"" Enderle said, ""and given that the U.S. is moving aggressively against the use of these currencies, it's doubtful that the current generation will survive.""

	The collapse of Japan's Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange is spilling into U.S. bankruptcy court as the company scrambles for legal cover after losing digital currency valued at $473 million.
	Mt. Gox's bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday supplements a similar petition made in Japan late last month following the exchange's abrupt closure. The U.S. case is being brought under Chapter 15 of the country's bankruptcy code, which provides a haven for foreign companies seeking to reorganize their finances.
	Mt. Gox's downfall provided fresh ammunition for bitcoin skeptics who have questioned the security and staying power of a digital currency created six years ago as an alternative to government-controlled monetary systems that rely on banks to process most transactions.
	Once the world's largest exchange specializing in bitcoins, Mt. Gox is now mired in a financial mess. The exchange froze its users' accounts last month and then shut down after acknowledging it couldn't account for 850,000 bitcoins. Mt. Gox CEO Robert Karpeles blamed most of the losses on computer hackers who took advantage of the exchange's flawed software.
	The missing currency, valued at $473 million at the time of Mt. Gox's Feb. 28 bankruptcy filing in Japan, represents about 7 per cent of all bitcoins in worldwide circulation, according to court documents.
	Although it's based in Tokyo, Mt. Gox is opening a U.S. bankruptcy case in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in Illinois on behalf of all U.S. residents burned by the exchange's demise.
	The civil complaint brought against Mt. Gox by Illinois resident Gregory Greene alleges the exchange engaged in fraud and other misconduct. The suit is seeking to be certified as a class action that would represent all U.S. residents who had paid fees to Mt. Gox as part of a bitcoin trade or had their accounts frozen.
	Steven Woodrow, a Denver attorney representing Greene, estimates hundreds of thousands of people could be represented in the case. In a Monday interview, Woodrow said he still intends to seek a federal court order that would freeze Mt. Gox's computers and other assets in the U.S. A hearing on Woodrow's request for the court order is scheduled for Tuesday in Chicago.
	If the Illinois case proceeds, Mt. Gox attorneys contend that it will drain the company's finances and divert management's attention during a critical time.
	Mt. Gox's bankruptcy papers list liabilities of about $64 million and assets of $38 million.
	Mt. Gox also is hoping to use U.S. bankruptcy laws to ward off another lawsuit filed last year in a Seattle federal court by a former U.S. partner, CoinLab Action.
	Under an agreement signed in November 2012, CoinLab was supposed to use Mt. Gox's technology to run a bitcoin exchange in the U.S. and Canada. The alliance unraveled within a few months, prompting CoinLab to sue Mt. Gox for alleged breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking $75 million in damages, according to court documents.AdvertisementDid you capture some amazing images or video?

222	"Via Flickr/antanacoinsAs you might remember, last month the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox completely imploded and filed for bankruptcy. Since that happened, the people who lost $350 million are understandably a wee bit upset and would like to know how, exactly, millions of dollars evaporated. Turns out, it might have been an inside job.
Hackers broke into both the personal blog and the Reddit account of Mark Karpeles, the CEO of Mt. Gox, to decry Mt. Gox’s complete silence on the issue, right about the time a whole bunch of data dropped about what’s on Mt. Gox’s servers. Turns out, something hinky may be in the works, according to CNET:The data dump claims that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The embattled exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, saying that Mt. Gox lost nearly 750,000 customer bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of the exchange’s own bitcoins.CNET could not independently confirm the veracity of the claims, but some Reddit users said they were able to confirm that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, which was posted in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.If true, that means there are 100,000 Bitcoins, currently valued at more than $600 million, that are unaccounted for and that Mt. Gox might be covering something up. This has to be tempered with the acknowledgement that this is an anonymous data dump, and the Bitcoin community is no more immune to trolling than any other subculture on the Internet. Also, Karpeles is not the most popular of people right now, for obvious reasons.That said, it certainly raises a few questions. Hopefully these questions will be addressed, especially as Mt. Gox tries to shut down; it just filed for bankruptcy in the US as well.Via CNETBitcoins are not worth over $6000 each. Your 100,000 BTC = $600 million is way, way off.An almost totally unregulated bank that exists only in cyberspace had money go missing. That’s weird.This seems like a drug dealer got paid in counterfeit money and reported it to the police."	Science

              A disgruntled bitcoin trader protests outside Mt. Gox offices in Tokyo. The bitcoin exchange, which is facing numerous lawsuits over the loss of hundreds of thousands of customers' bitcoins, has received bankruptcy protection in Japan and the U.S., which has stalled legal action pending against the Japanese company. (Shizuo Kambayashi/Associated Press)            Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets. Mt. Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.""This case involves a massive fraud,"" said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. ""They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honour, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.""Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.""We don't have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,"" said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.Mt. Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.Hale's order protects Mt. Gox's U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.Mt Gox's tangled web of shell corporations turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies' owners.The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company's true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies' activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means ""worthless little symbol"" in Latin), but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French-Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Del., and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries since he speaks French.When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Senator Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver's licence or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

225	PFhub - Business, Financial & Economic NewsPFhub is the the authoritative source of economic, business and financial news from around the world.With three bitcoin exchanges shutting down after experiencing thefts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, some in the bitcoin community are urging government regulation and intervention to protect consumers. It was reported Sunday that Mt. Gox, one of the world’s biggest exchange platforms, suffered 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its shutdown.After years of the peer-to-peer decentralized system decrying government officials getting involved, should the bitcoin community accept authorities entering into the market? If so, is it justifiable?Over the past year, since the rise of bitcoin and its growing acceptance among the Internet landscape and merchants, numerous central banks and federal governments have outlined a series of messages: it won’t be held responsible if any digital holdings vanish. The institutions have also urged its citizens to be cautious because the cryptocurrency is volatile, risky and vulnerable to security attacks.Bitcoiners, who many believe to be “techno-libertarians,” scoffed at the suggestion that authority figures should even intervene. The state of New York is in the midst of issuing bitlicenses for businesses transacting with bitcoins, while some federal lawmakers are calling for heightened regulation or outright bans of the virtual currency. Japan has also mulled over the idea of intervening following the failure of Mt. Gox, but instead wants international cooperation.Although bitcoin was founded on the premise of being decentralized and anonymous and therefore anti-government, using the tools of government could very well be legitimate and still consistent in the digital currency’s principles. However, its very nature could prove troublesome for some cash-strapped governments because of the intricacies involved.Indeed, in a libertarian society, free markets prevail but there is still a role for a government: enforcement of contracts, the protection of private property, safety from fraud and defense against force. The same could be applied here: an invasion of property was undertaken and theft transpired so authorities must investigate and detain the alleged perpetrators. It’s as simple as that and perhaps consistent in the libertarian message.It has become rather prevalent that several leading bitcoin individuals and organizations have called for regulation of the digital currency. We reported that Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and chief executive of Coinbase, called for bitcoin regulation. It was also discovered last month that the Bitcoin Foundation, which has also urged for regulatory actions, worked with the New York prosecutor’s office in its probe of Mt. Gox.On top of all of this, one whistleblower is threatening to unveil a web of corruption at the Bitcoin Foundation. Identified as Two-Bit Idiot, he published a blog post on Tumblr entitled “Coup or Death for the Bitcoin Foundation?” He plans to post another article listing “damning facts,” including:“There is evidence that Bitcoin Foundation board members may have had direct access to Mark Karpeles which allowed them to personally deposit and withdraw funds from Mt. Gox, despite persistent delays for other customers.”After a leadership that has decried government coercion against bitcoin, it now seems the same individuals are running to the government for help. Is this the step that the bitcoin community wants to take next? Since the currency is decentralized and there is actual “leader per se, it could be proven difficult to solicit the opinions of its base. Sure, the leadership may want regulations, but what about the people? The people should say if they want regulation or not.Recommended for you:	Science
226	"Mt. Gox, the former major Bitcoin exchange, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US as part of a bid to protect itself from legal action in this country. The exchange had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan back in February, but had avoided doing so in the United States. This latest move was almost certainly precipitated by Sunday’s announcement that hackers had breached Mt. Gox’s records and were publishing data dumps “proving” that Mt. Gox still possessed roughly 950,000 Bitcoins — far more than the 850,000 the company claims to have lost.Considering that 850,000 BTC is still worth roughly $530 million at today’s exchange rates, it’s easy to see why so many people are incensed at the actions of Mt. Gox and the disappearance of its CEO, Mark Karpeles. Reports on Mt. Gox’s troubles over the past few months paint Karpeles as distracted, poorly organized, and ultimately more interested in launching a Bitcoin cafe in the same building as the exchange rather than working to solve the security problems of the site itself.The hackers released screenshots and other data that purport to show Mt. Gox moving hundreds of BTC to customer wallets even after “transaction malleability” issues had supposedly prevented Mt. Gox from making any transactions at all. Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US allows the company to protect its US assets and recognize its declaration of bankruptcy in US Courts. It can be contested by US creditors.Unfortunately for Karpeles, filing for legal protection in the United States immediately after hackers claim to have discovered allegations of criminal misconduct will almost certainly fan the flames of the investors and BTC owners already calling for his head. Bankruptcy protection is not an absolute shield — it can protect a company from being chopped up and liquidated by creditors (at least, for a little while) — but it doesn’t shield a company from criminal charges or theft of property.One word of caution, however, before accepting the word of the hacking crew as gospel: others have noted that attempts to read Mt. Gox’s activities through the block chain are exceptionally difficult, partly because the software that performs deep block chain analysis is still in its infancy. Similarly, pouring through hundreds of megabytes of records doesn’t automatically link those logged transactions with the block chain history.Even if data released by the hack is legitimate, it will take a great deal of time to establish its authenticity and confirm that Mt. Gox is or isn’t criminally absconding with other people’s money. If the company has engaged in criminal fraud, than filing bankruptcy won’t save it. If it hasn’t, then the leaks may end up shedding light on how the attacks against Mt. Gox were carried out — which could, in turn, lead to criminal negligence charges depending on the nature of the security breaches.It’s clear that Mark Karpeles had neither the intelligence nor the discipline to lead a major Bitcoin exchange, but teasing out the details of the attacks and establishing Mt. Gox’s culpability is going to take time. Meanwhile, the overarching situation around BTC continues to take its own bizarre turns. On Friday, BTC blogger Ryan Selkis promised to unleash information that would destroy the legitimacy of the Bitcoin Foundation by elaborating on various unspecified “damning facts.”On Monday, Selkis declared that he had made a tactical error and would not be publishing said facts, leaving the community with plenty of questions and a great deal of mud to fling — but not much more. Then there’s last week’s battle over the identity of Sakoshi Nakamoto who may (or may not) be a 64-year-old man living in the Los Angeles foothills. In every instance, who you believe depends far more on faith than on hard fact. Speculation on the motivations and identities of the players runs just as rampant as speculation on cryptocurrencies themselves.I really wish I could pick up a few crypto textbooks and spend a few years down this rabbit hole, digging deep into the math to understand how this all works.  While I get it on a very superficial level, something about the entire picture doesn’t jive.  Maybe it’s the supposed “collision-less” guarantees.  As a programmer that uses hash functions, I routinely have to account for collisions.This talk about deep chain block analysis has got me interested. Surely somebody could write an entertaining log on how this is done. Or maybe the ET folk could find somebody to write it. We all need to know this stuff!James — The hash used for Bitcoin is SHA-256 — a 256-bit hash. That makes the odds of a collision insanely small. Much different from the typical computer hash table that tries to put values into a much smaller number of bins.It’s always those edge conditions where vulnerabilities, deadlocks, and crashes lie.  Make your sparse hash table huge to reduce the chance of a collision, and some enterprising person will figure out how to fill the table to overflow it with just the right values to cause arbitrary code to run.  As I routinely remind people too lazy to write in checks, “infinitely small” does not equal zero.Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

227	"Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles lied when he said that the former world's biggest Bitcoin exchange – which filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Sunday and in Japan on Feb. 28 – had been relieved of 850,000 Bitcoins by hackers, according to the alleged hackers themselves.“We stole no bitcoins,” the alleged miscreants wrote on Karpeles' hacked and defaced blog on Sunday, which was posted on Pastebin not long after. “There were none to steal.”The alleged Bitcoin thieves posted a breakdown of Bitcoin balances by country that totaled more than 950,000 Bitcoins, and included a file that was said to contain relevant database dumps, CSV exports, specialized tools and highlighted summaries compiled from the data. User database dumps are said not to have been included.Bitcoin users took to Reddit on Sunday to discuss how an executable – contained in the downloadable file posted by the hackers – may actually be a Bitcoin wallet stealing malware; however, some users indicated that the other information contained within the downloadable is still correct.Karpeles announced in Japan earlier this month that hackers had taken advantage of weaknesses in the exchange's computer systems and stole 750,000 customer Bitcoins and 100,000 Mt. Gox owned Bitcoins – which currently amounts to more than half a billion dollars.Shortly after, roughly 1,700 lines of code allegedly belonging to Mt. Gox was posted on Pastebin. Frode Nilsen, a developer with five years of experience working on banking applications with money transactions, told SCMagazine.com at the time that the code was very amateur and explained that the most glaring offense is a vulnerability to SQL injection.Mt. Gox claimed the issue that allowed hackers to steal Bitcoins involved a vulnerability in a Bitcoin software algorithm. The exchange filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in Dallas on Sunday, stating that hackers took advantage of “a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies Bitcoin,” according to documents. “This Chapter 15 case is being filed in an effort to maximize recoveries to, and provide for an equitable distribution of value among, all creditors,” according to the documents. A Mt. Gox “Crisis Strategy Draft” discovered online, but not confirmed authentic, indicates that there are 1.1 million accounts and 550,000 verified customers.Although the trials and tribulations involving Mt. Gox continue to turn heads, one thing is certain – the number of attacks in the virtual currency market are increasing. Bitcoin bank Flexcoin recently announced it was shutting down after attackers stole all 896 Bitcoins, and not long after, cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex announced that a hacker took advantage of a vulnerability in the website's withdrawal protocol and made off with 12.3 percent of Bitcoins. Still, Bitcoin value continues to stay relatively strong, with a single coin being valued at around $620 as of Monday.

Matthew Feeney|March 10, 2014The latest news on Bitcoin: Mt.
Gox has filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection, a move that will
stop U.S. legal action against the Bitcoin exchange, which is based
in Japan.  Previous news on Bitcoin: Hackers who targeted the CEO of Mt. Gox, a Japanese bitcoin
exchange that claimed to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars
in bitcoin, say they're convinced the CEO is hoarding the
bitcoins the company says are stolen.The man Newsweek identified as the creator of Bitcoin,

Satoshi Nakamoto, is now trying to avoid the press while
denying that he is the currency's founder.American Autumn Radtke, CEO of a virtual currency exchange
called First Meta, was 
found dead at the end of February in Singapore but not widely
reported until March. Police do not suspect foul play.Newsweek reports
on the search for Satoshi Nakamoto, which it says is a 64-year old
Japanese-American living in San Bernardino named Satoshi
Nakamoto.Bitcoin bank Flexcoin has
shut down following a March 2 hacking that robbed it of all its
virtual currency.A Mt. Gox customer 
filed suit in Chicago February 28 against the Japanese
exchange, attempting to start a class action claim for all American
customers who lost money.The Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox 
filed for bankruptcy and blamed hackers for the loss of
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the digital
currency. West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin is calling on financial
regulators to ban
the virtual currency, calling it a tool for laundering money
and a threat to the U.S. economy.According to a “crisis strategy draft” plan said to have been
created by Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange has lost around $350
million worth in Bitcoin after a years-long hacking campaign.Wired is reporting that “Bitcoin insiders” had been
preparing for bad news from Mt. Gox for weeks, although the scale
of the theft took many by surprise.Responding to the news, bitcoin wallet-makers Coinbase and
Blockchain released a joint statement saying, “There are hundreds
of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin.”From 
Wired:The hacking attack is detailed in a leaked “crisis strategy
draft” plan, apparently created by Gox and published Monday by Ryan
Selkis, a bitcoin entrepreneur and blogger (see below). According
to the document, the exchange is insolvent after losing 744,408
bitcoins — worth about $350 million at Monday’s trading prices. The
plan paints a bleak picture of the exchange’s finances and outlines
an arbitrage scheme to restore the exchange to solvency. “The
reality is that Mt. Gox can go bankrupt at any moment, and
certainly deserves to as a company,” the document states.
CNN is reporting that Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles resigned from
the Bitcoin Foundation's board of directors last weekend.The Mercatus Center's Jerry Brito breifly mentioned the slow
implosion of Mt. Gox in his article for Reason.com yesterday titled

Bitcoin the Key to Digital Copyright?""More from Reason.com on Bitcoin here.Matthew Feeney is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute.Matthew Feeney is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute.

accounting. Especially for the way that Bitcoin transactions
work.Some exchanges may need some more checks for integrity and fraud
prevention built into them. Other exchanges may not. I haven't seen
the proprietary code behind those systems. Furthermore, when an
'altcoin bank' is not insured by a reputable entity, it is a really
stupid ass idea to leave your coins in the exchange. You can create
a unique address for each payment (which should be a standard built
into all 'altcoin' style trading software in my opinion). Then
someone can only bang that account address for exactly what you

230	Just last month, it was reported that bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox vanished from the Internet. At the time, the website for the major exchange was unavailable and over 744,000 bitcoins were supposedly missing due to malleability-related theft. In all, Mt. Gox lost around $474 million worth of bitcoins due to a software algorithm flaw that underlies bitcoin, according to the exchange. A major investigation is ongoing however, which may provide different information regarding the loss of bitcoins. Now, the major bitcoin exchange has filed for bankruptcy within the United States, seeking protection against various lawsuits that have been filed by customers of Mt. Gox. If the bankruptcy petition is approved, claims against the company will be halted temporarily.The bankruptcy filing was made by the only board member of Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles. The case is identified as Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.Source: PCWorld and Reuters	Science

	While the Bitcoin community is impatiently waiting for Mt. Gox to provide details on the massive hacker attack that stole 6 percent of all the Bitcoin in the world, a group of hackers, who claim to have broken into the bankrupted Bitcoin exchange's servers, said that the company still has at least some of customers' Bitcoins.
	According to a Forbes report, the hacker group on Sunday took over the personal blog and Reddit account of Mt. Gox's CEO Mark Karpeles to announce that the exchange has access to a portion of the Bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from customers.
	To support the claim, the group uploaded a series of files including an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, a screenshot purportedly confirming the hackers' access to the data, a list of Mark Karpeles’ home addresses, his personal CV, and more.
	Hackers also point to a balance file, which reportedly shows a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins, to prove that Mt. Gox's claim to have lost customers’ Bitcoins to hackers is nothing but a lie. “That fat fuck has been lying!!”, a note in the file from the hackers reportedly reads.
	While the legitimacy of the database dump is yet to be verified, it could also be an accounting mismatch with the company's actual store of Bitcoins, report says. The stolen money hasn't yet appeared on the log of Bitcoin blockchain, the public ledger of transactions that prevents fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy, suggesting that whoever has it isn't spending it at the moment.
	In another, possibly related event, a user on the BitcoinTalk forum posted a message offering a 20 GB stolen database from Mt. Gox for 100 Bitcoins. According to the user, the database contains Mt. Gox users' personal details and passport scans.© 2018 TechSpot, Inc. All Rights Reserved.TechSpot is a registered trademark. Terms of Use Privacy Policy Licensing Advertise Powered by "	Science

Gox ‒ previously the world's largest bitcoin exchange ‒ filed for U.S. bankruptcy. Reuters reported, ""The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.""On Sunday, hackers hijacked Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog and accused him of lying about Bitcoins being stolen. If the 950,000 bitcoin balance posted by unidentified hackers is accurate, then there are 100,000 bitcoins missing. On Feb. 28, Mt. Gox claimed to have lost 850,000 bitcoins and filed bankruptcy protection in a Tokyo District Court. But the hackers claimed, ""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed."" Next to a balance of 951,116 bitcoins, the hackers noted, ""That fat [bleep] has been lying!""The hackers wrote, ""We stole no bitcoins. There were none to steal."" However, the post included links to a zipped file with .exe and Mac .app files; Reddit users warned the file contains bitcoin-stealing malware.[ Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need. | Get the latest from CSO by signing up for our newsletters. ]Apparently Forbes looked at it before reporting:The hackers also posted a 716 megabyte file to Karpeles' personal website that they said comprised stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers. It appears to include an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, a file that purports to show the company's balances in eighteen difference currencies, the backoffice application for some sort of administrative access to the databases of Mt. Gox's parent company Tibanne Limited, a screenshot of the hackers' access to those databases, a list of Mark Karpeles' home addresses and Karpeles' personal CV.Forbes was unable to verify the info, but the many commenters over the web say it is the real deal. Then again, that could be social engineering so people with bitcoins will download the file, click on the tainted .exe, and lose their bitcoins to the hackers. Although the ""attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox,"" they ""wrote they purposely withheld users' personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.""Elsewhere, a user going by nanashi___ posted on bitcointalk:I am selling all data obtained in recently MT. Gox database hack.

One was from an Illinois resident who ""sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt.

Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange that collapsed last month after the loss of around $474 million worth of Bitcoins, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S.The petition, made late Sunday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, will be heard later Monday -- a day before a court in Chicago is expected to rule on whether a U.S. class-action lawsuit can proceed against the company.If successful in its Dallas filing, lawsuits in the U.S. against the company would be temporarily halted.That would give Mt. Gox a little breathing room while the Tokyo District Court works through the collapse of the company and how best to proceed with bankruptcy.The Chicago case is one of two that have been filed against Mt. Gox. A second case was filed in May 2013 by Coinlab alleging breach of contract.Mt. Gox was once the largest Bitcoin trading exchange in the world, offering a platform where customers could buy and sell the virtual currency for real-world cash.But that all came to a halt Feb. 25 when the company suspended trading and admitted it had lost around 750,000 Bitcoins owned by customers and around 100,000 of its own. An investigation into the loss is ongoing, but the company has said it believes a flaw in the Bitcoin software allowed an unknown party to steal the Bitcoins.The filing estimates the company has more than 100,000 creditors, assets of ¥6.5 billion (US$63 million) and liabilities of ¥3.84 billion.It was made on behalf of Mt. Gox by Mark Karpeles, the company's sole board member. Mt. Gox has two shareholders: Tibanne Co. Ltd., which owns 88 percent, and an individual, Jed MacCaleb, who holds 12 percent. MacCaleb developed the software that ran the service.The case is 14-31229, MtGox Co.

With Bitcoin companies becoming an increasingly popular target for attacks, hackers over the weekend allegedly gained access to Mt. Gox’s database, purportedly showing the exchange still had more than 950,000 Bitcoins worth about $590 million. They published this information on Mt.

  instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting goxed,” hackers
  wrote in a message posted to Karpeles’ personal website and
  Pastebin. The term “Goxed” stems from Mt. Gox repeatedly delaying
  its reopening in 2011 (as well as going offline or suspending
  trade on numerous other occasions), and means to fool or troll
  someone.
  ""Included in this download you will find relevant database
  dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted
  summaries compiled from data,"" the hackers wrote. ""No
  user database dumps have been included.""
  The bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy in late February after
  it was apparently plagued with technical glitches, losing nearly
  750,000 bitcoins, or 6-7 percent of total units in circulation.
  
  However, some Mt. Gox users weren’t convinced of the explanation
  that technical bugs had caused the loss. Some suggested that the
  missing money had been absorbed by Karpeles.
  
  Attacks have subsequently been undertaken on both Karpeles’
  personal blog and his Reddit account, to look for evidence that
  he was responsible for fraud.
  
  The attackers took as much information as possible surrounding
  trading activity at Mt. Gox and stored their findings in a 716MB
  file.
  
  The file contained a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet detailing some
  one million trades, and another which showed company balances in
  18 various currencies, according to Forbes.
  
  The claimed balance of 951,116 bitcoins found by hackers and
  outlined in their summary was cited as evidence that Karpeles had
  been lying about losing the bitcoins to a bug. “That fat f***
  has been lying!!” states a note in the file.
  
  The authenticity of the file is still to be confirmed. However,
  some Reddit users told CNET that they could confirm that their
  personal account balances matched the data in the posting. Other
  Redditors suggested the file contained malware, and as a result
  would not open it.
  
  Mt. Gox later released a warning saying that “Spam/Phishing
  emails looking as if Mt. Gox was the sender are being sent to our
  users. These emails have not been sent by us and should be
  phishing emails.”
  
  Despite the loss of some 750,000 bitcoins, there has – as of yet
  – been no evidence of their movement in the bitcoin blockchain.
  This suggests that the bitcoins are not currently being spent.
  
  At its peak, Mt. Gox was one of the most prominent bitcoin
  exchanges in the world. However, on February 7, the platform
  suspended its customer withdrawals, and bitcoin plunged – but Mt.
  Gox did not stop trading the cryptocurrency.
  
  Mt. Gox filed for US bankruptcy protection in Dallas on Sunday,
  after initially filing for bankruptcy protection in Japan on
  February 28.

241	Bitcoin’s been getting ugly. Very ugly.The first rumblings came last summer, when Mt Gox, the biggest bitcoin exchange at the time, began dragging its feet meeting redemptions. By November, some people were waiting weeks to get their withdrawal requests honored. Many waited three months or more for their money… while bitcoin prices soared. If Mt Gox were a bank or securities broker dealer, it would have long ago earned the scrutiny of multiple regulatory agencies. But Mt Gox is none of those things.Mt Gox, the online repository of billions of dollars worth of the beleaguered, nationless, digital currency, is actually the ancestor of an online site first launched in 2007, where nerds and geeks could trade Magic™ cards – a popular fantasy card game.Jed McCaleb, the site’s founder, read an article about Bitcoin somewhere and wrote some code turning his playing card site into an unregulated online currency exchange. And eventually sold 88 percent of it to a French national named Mark Karpeles. The site grew under Karpeles, and eventually handled more than 70 percent of the world’s bitcoin float – amassing billions of dollars in theoretical assets, given bitcoin’s exchange rates – but still operating in a regulatory vacuum.This much is by design. Bitcoin aficionados were generally careful about not attracting regulator attention. Among the key attractions of bitcoin were its independence from governments and central banks.Mt Gox suffered a serious security breach in 2011, in which a hacker transferred a bunch of bitcoins to himself at a penny per bitcoin, and then began to sell them. A number of large accounts ate the loss, but the price returned to normal in a few minutes, so the damage could be limited.There were a number of teething problems, as well, attributed to programming snafus or confusion with other online exchanges. But in reality, there was a cancer that was already eating away at Mt Gox and bitcoin from the inside. Thieves, hackers or insiders had penetrated the network somehow, and stole $400 million.Meanwhile, even as Mt Gox was going through its death throes, Autumn Radtke, a Wisconsin native and the CEO of another bitcoin exchange, First Meta, turned up dead in her Singapore apartment. She was 28. Singapore officials have not yet announced an official cause of death, but early indications seem to point to suicide.Flexcoin, another bitcoin exchange out of Canada, hung up its spurs this week, too, after announcing that hackers had pierced its servers and stole all of its ‘hot wallet’ bitcoin – $600,000 worth at the then-current exchange rate. (The company’s clients who held bitcoin in servers that were not connected to the Internet didn’t lose money. The hacker couldn’t get to those accounts.)“Flexcoin has made every attempt to keep our servers as secure as possible, including regular testing. In our ~3 years of existence we have successfully repelled thousands of attacks. But in the end, this was simply not enough,” the company said in a statement posted online.“Having this be the demise of our small company, after the endless hours of work we’ve put in, was never our intent. We’ve failed our customers, our business, and ultimately the Bitcoin community.”While we don’t know yet what led to Ms. Radke’s suicide – assuming it was, indeed, a suicide, bitcoin has been under sophisticated attack for a long time. Flexcoin managers announced that they had actually repelled thousands of attacks over their time in operation before hackers found the flaw and wiped them out.Bitcoin had a good chance of pulling through intact if the damage were limited to problems at Mt Gox. The stolen bitcoin were substantial, but amounted to 6 percent of the world’s float. Some players were happy to see Mt Gox go, as it happened.Bitcoin bears have argued that the widely distributed computer mining and storage system that was bitcoin’s greatest strength and attraction may become its fatal flaw: The encryption and firewall technology at these small, innovative online exchanges is just not up to the task of fending off the world’s most sophisticated and determined cyber-criminals and state cyber-warfare agencies, who may have been teaming up to steal as much bitcoin as they could – and no doubt sell it before the word got out. Megan McArdle, writing for Bloomberg, wrote that the Mt Gox meltdown “spells doom for bitcoin.”  While bitcoin did pull back from its early December peak, and has been declining all last February, the price has recovered somewhat in March, to levels it was at in mid-November – before the fatal problems at Mt Gox and Flexcoin were discovered. At press time, bitcoin was trading in the $667 range.Will we have more exchanges go down to theft and fraud? No doubt other exchanges are being targeted by online criminals and perhaps state actors as we speak. And no doubt these exchanges themselves are scrambling to beef up their firewalls and encryption security and tighten up their code. They can all expect the very toughest adversaries in the hacker business, and they won’t let up any time soon.Bitcoin seems more secure if you keep your digital coin offline – that is, not connected to the Internet. Keep it in an offline hard drive that’s not even hooked up to your computer – and then don’t lose that hard drive!Meanwhile, bitcoin is very good at one thing: Transferring large sums of money around the world, cheap, with near perfect anonymity. That is bitcoin’s unique value proposition – and it seems that that value proposition is sufficiently valuable for a critical mass of people to endure the significant price volatility and the risk of hacker theft.Read More from NerdWalletBest Stock Sectors of 2013: Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary stocks up over 30%How to Find the Best Auto Insurance Bitcoin image courtesy of ShutterstockNerdWallet's tailored advice, content and tools ensure you're getting more from your money.Disclaimer: NerdWallet has entered into referral and advertising arrangements with certain broker-dealers under which we receive compensation (in the form of flat fees per qualifying action) when you click on links to our partner broker-dealers and/or submit an application or get approved for a brokerage account.

242	"Every transaction on MtGox since 2011 has been leaked online by hackers accusing the company’s chief executive of stealing their money
Alex Hern

Mon 10 Mar 2014 18.35 GMT


Last modified on Tue 21 Feb 2017 18.52 GMT

Hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, the chief executive of shuttered bitcoin exchange MtGox, on Sunday night.The anonymous attackers used the accounts to post an angry letter accusing Karpeles of stealing bitcoins from his site’s former users, and posted a 750Mb zip file which they say comprises data stolen directly from MtGox’s servers.“It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote on Karpeles’ blog, “Magical Tux“ (and crossposted to Pastebin). “This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.”Several members of the bitcoin community claim to have found their own transactions included in the dump, which would indicate that the leak is genuine. The hacker or hackers themselves say they were careful to strip out any passwords from the database. But other reports suggest that a second scam could be involved, with an application contained within the zip file, called TibanneBackOffice, apparently stealing users’ bitcoin wallets.The hackers imply that one particular line in the data, which shows MtGox as holding 951,000 bitcoins at the time of its collapse, is proof of the company’s malfeasance, annotating the line with the comment: “That fat fuck has been lying!!” However, others who have downloaded the database point out that it remains possible that MtGox’s internal accounts were out of sync with the amount of money they actually held.Roubini: it’s a Ponzi schemeThe release of the MtGox database followed a stinging attack on bitcoin by influential economist Nouriel Roubini.Writing on Twitter, Roubini said that, apart from a base for criminal activities, “bitcoin is not a currency”. “Bitcoin is not a unit of account as no price of goods and services is set in Bitcoin unit nor it ever will. So it isn’t a currency,” he added.Instead, he contended that bitcoin is between “a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isn’t safe given hacking of it.” A Ponzi, or “pyramid”, scheme relies on taking money from people joining it to pay out as interest to people who joined earlier; as such it is unsustainable. Bernie Madoff operated a giant pyramid scheme, for which he was jailed. But pyramid schemes were also blamed for a collapse in the Albanian economy in 1996/7, when they amounted to almost half of the country’s GDP - and their collapse led to civil war and thousands of deaths. Less damage seems to have been caused by a site called “Ponzicoin”, which offered 120% repayments on bitcoins deposited with it through what its creator openly acknowledged was a pyramid scheme - illegal in a number of countries. According to the site’s creator, all depositors have been refunded; he blamed hackers for compromising his site and, he said, making it appear that he had run off with their money.• US prosecutors last year charged a man in Texas with running a bitcoin Ponzi scheme"	Science
243	"Monday, February 12, 2018 | Updated at  3:08 PM ETHackers have broken into several accounts of Mark Karpeles, the owner of the MtGox Bitcoin exchange. Mt. Gox stopped trading last month and filed for bankruptcy after reporting that $465 million in Bitcoins had been lost purportedly due to a security bug.Some have speculated that Karpeles, or the people behind Mt. Gox, pulled the heist on their own, effectively stealing the Bitcoins. However, in the highly unregulated marketplace of Bitcoins where there are no legal protections, it is unclear how measures can be enforced besides internet vigilantism. The hackers who have entered Karpeles' accounts seem to be motivated by frustration over the actions of Mt. Gox, whom many users entrusted with their Bitcoins only to lose their money.The Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange filed the application for bankruptcy protection in Japan through lawyers acting on behalf of the exchange, several days after Mt. Gox went offline following reports of a massive theft of Bitcoins. At the same time, the boss of the Mt. Gox exchange, Mark Karpeles, said that he was working hard to find a ""solution to our recent issues"".According to Mt. Gox, technical troubles prevented customers from transferring digital cash to other exchanges on Feb. 7, meaning that Bitcoin holders could not transfer their money out of the Mt. Gox network to protect their coins or cash out. The application for bankruptcy protection was accepted by a district court in Tokyo, where the company claimed to have outstanding debts of 6.5 billion yen, or over $60 million.Mt. Gox's lawyers decided to apply to the court for bankruptcy protection after regulators from the United States filed a subpoena against the company. Bitcoin is backed by major investor confidence, despite concerns by governments and efforts to shut down or control the digital currency. The primary concern is the lack of oversight and the ability for criminals in the illegal underworld to make protected transactions.Bitcoin can be used to bypass financial institutions, which makes it attractive to people who want to trade directly without going through any third parties, something which has led to adoption by speculative investors and criminal enterprises. A leaked FBI report back in 2012 revealed that the federal agency was concerned that Bitcoin could become widely used by criminals. The report said that the digital crypto-currency was an ""increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities beyond the cyber realm"" and that the US Senate committee commissioned the FBI to investigate Bitcoin.Many people in the community have called upon the exchange to release more information about what happened to the lost Bitcoins, about which currently not much is known. Hackers have taken this a step further by taking matters into their own hands. The recent attacks saw hackers entering both the personal blog and Reddit account of Mr. Karpeles, giving them access and control over both social media accounts.The hackers also broke into proprietary data behind the troubled exchange, taking detailed information about Mt. Gox's trading activities and posting them on the internet. They posted a 716 MB file containing documents from Mt. Gox, including an Excel spreadsheet that contained data on more than one million trades as well as entries from Mt. Gox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.The rogue hackers pointed out that although the exchange claimed that $465 million of Bitcoins, or the rough equivalent of approximately 744,000 coins, had disappeared from Mt. Gox, there was no activity suggesting that they had been traded. This was after pouring through the blockchain, or the the central list of buying and selling that keeps track of the activity of the Bitcoin network.Although users retain anonymity when trading Bitcoins, meaning their identity is secure, Bitcoins' unique codes mean that the movement of coins can still be traced. After they made the data dump, they wrote a message saying ""It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" referring to the glitches and instability behind the Mt. Gox exchange through its tenure, often caused by technical problems before finally closing after the multi-million dollar Bitcoin heist last month.Mt. Gox's shutdown has only contributed to the long story of instability within the Bitcoin market, where shortly after the theft the price settled to between five and six hundred dollars, compared to one thousand per Bitcoin late last year.Countries like China have forbidden merchants within its borders from accepting the digital currency in an effort to avoid the uncertainty involved, a move which has caused drops in the price. Vietnam has also banned its banks from from dealing in the cryptocurrency, saying that the virtual cash is not legal tender and that trading in bitcoins carried ""potential risks"" for users, similar to the European Union's stance on the industry.Customers concerned about their Bitcoin holdings have even travelled to Japan in an effort to reclaim their funds. Some travelled in protest, holding signs and talking to reporters.The firm behind Mt. Gox said that there was a ""high probability"" that the Bitcoins had been stolen through a bug in Mt. Gox's systems and that it has launched an investigation in order to find the culprits. Mt. Gox said that to ""establish the truth"" about what had happened a ""huge amount of transaction reports"" would need to be investigated and that because of this, Mt. Gox would not give the exact amount of missing deposit funds or the total number of Bitcoins that had disappeared.In addition to the approximately 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers that were lost, the company also said that it had lost approximately 100,000 of its own, or nearly $500 million. Mt. Gox said that it had appointed an expert to look into the possibility of criminal proceedings, saying ""We will make all efforts to ensure that crimes are punished and damages are recovered."" It is unclear about the possibility of paying back creditors, although the exchange did establish a call center to answer customers' questions.The Japanese government is still trying to determine what led to the collapse of Mt. Gox. ""We still have not had a clear grasp of the situation,"" Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. ""[We] don't know if it was a crime or just a bankruptcy."" Mt. Gox was not the only exchange that was targeted, since another Bitcoin bank called Flexcoin announced at the same time that it was going out of business, saying that it got hacked and got 896 coins stolen and is working with law enforcement to trace the source of the hack. ""As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately,"" it said.The intrigue surrounding Bitcoin is far from over. Last week, Newsweek claimed to have unveiled the man named Satoshi Nakamoto behind the virtual currency, although he denied everything, telling reporters ""I got nothing to do with it."" The 64-year-old Japanese physicist who lives in California was asked if he was involved with Bitcoin, and he said, ""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it."" Newsweek said it assigned a reporter to spend two months investigating the claim and tracking him down. Although it is not known whether Nakamoto is a pseudonym, the original creator is suspected to have several million dollars in Bitcoins since the early days of the currency.

Bitcoin exchange MtGox has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States.MarketWatch reported the defaulted Bitcoin exchange filed for Chapter 15 in the States to protect itself from lawsuits as it attempts to pay off its 6.5 billion yen (about $64m, £38m, AU$71m) debts.
MtGox previously filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on February 28, which only helped those in Tokyo and the US. With this new measur, foreign debtors and parties who lost their bitcoins on the MtGox can go through the US bankruptcy courts and systems to resolve their cases.Earlier last month, MtGox lost track of 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users as well as 100,000 of its own digital coins. As one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, it held more than 6% of the world's cryptocurrency, worth roughly $549 million (about £329m, AU$608m) by today's trading rates.In another bit of bad news, over the weekend hackers cracked into MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog MagicalTux.net as well as his Tumblr and Reddit accounts.The hackers used their access to post a zip file entitled MtGox2014Leak that claimed to reveal evidence of MtGox wrongdoing. Alleged internal documents inside the compressed archive claimed to reveal how the defunct exchange stole customer holdings and wrote them off as targets of theft.The file and Karpeles' personal blog have already been taken down, but not before users on Twitter and Reddit supposedly confirmed their personal account balances on the included Excel spreadsheet, potentially verifying its legitimacy.It's likely the same document also held passwords connected with MtGox, so we strongly urge users to change any of the same passwords they may have used elsewhere.Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

246	"A hack on the blog owned by Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles calls into questions some of the claims the company made in its bankruptcy announcement. Hackers uploaded a data dump which they claim shows customer data with real account balances. According to TechCrunch, users of the bitcoin site say the information is accurate because they have located their own balances on the data sheet.Perhaps the most interesting piece of information on that data dump is where it shows that Mt. Gox had a balance of more than 951,000 bitcoins. That’s significantly more than the 850,000 bitcoins the company said it had stolen. Of course this doesn’t mean that Mt. Gox lied or even miscalculated the number of bitcoins it had. However, there are enough users who claim their balances are on the data dump to suggest that there is a chance that something fishy is going on here.Along with the data dump, the hacker also posted a mirror page, which provides a clue about the identity of the hacker. It states, “I hated working with you. You deserve everything you get for what you did.” That note also suggests that there’s something more going on than what Mt. Gox has told the public.Mt. Gox has now filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. as well as Japan. The bitcoin exchange operator filed in Japan last month—an inevitable end to a weeks-long shutdown of the company’s site. The company claims hackers stole its bitcoins and that it will be unable to pay back what was stolen. Mt. Gox’s U.S. filing will temporarily stop U.S. legal action against it. Already a lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed against the bitcoin exchange. The lead plaintiff in that suit wants a judge to freeze the company’s U.S.-based servers and equipment and create a trust over the company’s assets.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!Comments are closed.

247	March 10, 20141:52 PM EDTMt. Gox, once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.A hearing in Dallas was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. local time on Monday to consider Mt. Gox’s request to stay pending lawsuits against the company.The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox’s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox’s assets.Mt. Gox’s Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ Bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the Bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies Bitcoin, the digital currency.The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox’s request for Chapter 15 protection.Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had Bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted Bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as Bitcoin prices plummeted last month.Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker & McKenzie.The case is Mt.

248	"Just days after it sought protection in Japan, once popular Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been forced to file for bankruptcy in the US in the hope of climbing out of the huge hole it's found itself in. Still reeling from the loss of 850,000 Bitcoins (currently worth around $549 million) and debts of more than $63.6 million, the company has filed papers that will temporarily suspend US legal action against it, allowing it to work out how ""weaknesses in the system"" allowed the digital currency to go missing in the first place. It's not quite the news customers were hoping for, but it's a logical move by Mt. Gox as it will better protect investors located outside of Japan and could also open avenues for it to take on financial aid. While it continues to piece together exactly what happened, some are taking matters into their own hands. Over the weekend, hackers reportedly gained access to Mt.

Over the weekend, anonymous hackers seemed to have taken over some of the accounts of CEO Mark Karpeles, an action that seems to have stemmed from the growing frustration over the uncertainty surrounding Mt. Gox. The attackers took over Karpeles' personal blog and Reddit account, accessing information about Mt. Gox's trading activity.The hackers posted a 716 MB file containing all the information they had accessed. It contained a spreadsheet of millions of trades, entries from Mt. Gox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.""It's time that Mt. Gox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" wrote the hackers in a message along with the data file.Goxed refers to the sudden interruptions in trading Mt. Gox imposed last month when it was having to deal with technical glitches. Last month, Mt. Gox shut down its service abruptly, took down its Twitter feed and deactivated its website following a glitch in their Bitcoin wallet. Later it was revealed that the company had lost approximately 750,000 bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 of its own bitcoins.

251	"Queens, NY (PRWEB) March 10, 2014  On Friday, February 28, 2014, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. The company, Mt. Gox, was based in Tokyo but has thousands of Bitcoin investors around the world. And while Mt. Gox has little recognition among Americans, it does raise several important issues surrounding bankruptcy in the new digital age. Bruce Feinstein, Esq., a bankruptcy attorney in Queens, New York, is using this recent news to shed light on the questions surrounding digital currency and bankruptcy in an increasingly global economy. “My clients are new to the Bitcoin phenomenon, some of them have never even heard of it,” says Mr. Feinstein. “But that only further underlines the fact that we need to start informing ourselves about Bitcoin and how to treat it when it comes to bankruptcy. One day we may all be dealing in digital currency, and our federal and state laws must provide the proper legal pathways to handle the issues that arise in our evolving global financial market.” Bitcoin is a form of decentralized digital currency established in 2009. It uses cryptography to control the creation and transfer of funds, and bitcoin holders can transfer the money using a special software on their computers and mobile devices. The Bitcoin phenomenon spawned a number of start-ups and trading companies, one of which was Mt. Gox. The company grew into a major player in the Bitcoin industry, only to be toppled when hackers stole approximately $460 million, or 850, 000 bitcoins according to a Wired Magazine article published on March 3, 2014. Mt. Gox subsequently filed for bankruptcy after stopping trades and refusing to pay out its investors. It’s stories like these that take innovations like Bitcoin and turn them into nightmare scenarios. Mr Feinstein adds, “On the surface, a company like Mt. Gox is a wonderful entrepreneurial concept. But when you’re working in a new financial market that is taking place outside the banking industry and outside the Fed, you begin to encounter safety concerns such as lack of regulation, possible money laundering, and cyber attacks.”And when a cyber attack did affect Mt. Gox, the result was devastating for the company and its investors. Mr. Feinstein advocates a discussion about creating a legal structure for digital currencies that will protect those who invest in them and develop them. Mt. Gox entered the equivalent of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., and Mr. Feinstein’s firm – which provides Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy aid - continues to monitor this developing story. The Law Offices of Bruce Feinstein, Esq. has nearly two decades of experience in bankruptcy law, helping clients and families resolve their issues and move forward with their lives.

Reports say, it was hit with crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.The hackers take control of multiple computers during the DDoS attacks and send a flood of data to the target through these computers. These kinds of attacks cause servers to crash and make the websites unavailable.Bitcoin is an experimental decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone across the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority.

During a news conference in Japan, Karpeles claimed 850,000 Bitcoins (worth around $549 million at current prices) had disappeared due to ""weaknesses in the system,"" while bankruptcy filings claimed a debt of $63.6 million. How many Bitcoins were really left in the vault, what happened to the rest and whether or not account holders will ever get their currency back is still unknown.Forbes points out a (now deleted) forum post that offered a 20GB Mt. Gox database file for sale at a price of 100 Bitcoins. The poster claimed it holds personal details and even passport scans of the site's users, which only adds to the concerns of anyone who had an account before the exchange shut down last month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin watchers have noticed $113 million in coins linked to Mt.

  Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last
  month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for
  several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said
  Sunday.

  The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection
  in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars
  in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in
  particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.

  While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange
  also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
  attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming
  its sources.

  Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a
  flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.

  The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins
  were stolen, the Yomiuri said.

  MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's
  customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that
  the company owned.

  Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is
  generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network
  of computers around the planet.

  After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of
  its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to
  $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off
  to the current $610 level.

  Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked
  by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime
  or terrorism.

  US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no
  powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central
  authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and
  China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.

  Japanese officials have said they were closely monitoring MtGox's
  bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and
  why the exchange imploded.

American Honda has reassigned marketing boss Mike Accavitti to lead the Acura brand amid a restructuring of the automaker's North American operation that will group marketing and sales functions under separate divisions for the Honda and Acura brands.Mr. Accavitti, currently in charge of marketing and product planning as senior VP-automobile operations at American Honda, will add the newly created role of general manager of the new Acura Division. In that role, he will oversee all sales, marketing and parts and service operation for the Acura brand in North America, while ceding official product-planning duties and oversight of national marketing for the Honda brand.Meanwhile, Acura sales boss Jeff Conrad will be promoted to senior VP at American Honda and will take over all sales and marketing efforts for the Honda brand as general manager of the newly created Honda Division.The Honda and Acura divisions will be housed under a single operation, to be called American Honda Auto Division, led by current American Honda sales boss John Mendel. Both Mr. Conrad and Mr. Accavitti will report to Mr. Mendel.The changes are effective April 1, the start of Honda's next fiscal year.Previously, American Honda separated key operations by function, rather than by brand. For example, Accavitti oversees product planning and national marketing in his current role for both Honda and Acura, while regional marketing initiatives were handled by American Honda's sales division led by Mendel.""The goal is really to accelerate the sales growth we've had with both Honda and Acura through a more cohesive type of strategy that we think will bring greater focus,"" to each brand, Mr. Mendel said in a conference call earlier today with reporters.""This is going to group major activities for the Honda and Acura brands under dedicated brand leaders, allowing us to respond to the marketplace, focus on the customer and really do so with greater speed and efficiency,"" Mr. Mendel said.--Automotive News

""These moves will more completely align the major activities for the Honda and Acura brands under dedicated brand leaders.""Accavitti, with his marketing background at Honda and previously, at Chrysler, would sound like the right man for the job. He has created highly regarded Super Bowl ads and his background from Chrysler taught him how to jazz up a brand and create buzz where there were only crickets before.Acura needs all the help it can get. Acura vehicles have kept their reputation as dependable and high quality, but they lack flash and pizzazz. The entry-level ILX never really got out of the starting gate.

264	Working to shore up its upscale Acura brand, Honda Motor Co. plans to split its sales and marketing efforts into separate divisions in the U.S.Honda is looking to punch some energy into Acura, which has lagged its bigger Honda sibling in sales growth and has struggled to carve out a strong image. Acura sold 165,000 vehicles in the U.S. last year, down considerably from the peak of 209,610 it sold in 2005.Industry veteran Michael Accavitti will become senior vice president and general manager of the Acura Division, the Japanese automaker said Monday. He previously headed national marketing of both the Honda and Acura brands. Jeff Conrad will become senior vice president and general manager of the Honda Division.  While Acura packs its vehicles with technology equal to any of the luxury makes, it has struggled to convince consumers that it is on the same playing field with brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Lexus, said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst at IHS Automotive.“The parts seem to be there, they just haven’t found the secret sauce,” Brinley said. “There’s not a lot of panache or excitement.”It wasn’t always that way. Acura’s initial sedans, the Legend and smaller Integra were well received when they were introduced in the late 1980s. But successive sedans haven’t matched up “and they have struggled to communicate a solid image,” Brinley said.That’s left Acura as more of a sport-utility vehicle company. Just two SUVs, the MDX and RDX, accounted for almost 60% of the brand’s sales last year. Styling also has held Acura back, gyrating from conservative to outrageous “and neither has worked particularly well,” said Jack Nerad, an analyst at auto information company Kelley Blue Book.“They need a model or two with great exterior styling that can change people’s perceptions about the brand,” Nerad said. The new structure demonstrates that Honda is prepared to devote the resources necessary to “revitalize” Acura, said John Mendel, executive vice president of American Honda Motor Co., who will oversee both brands.“This move obviously reflects the deep commitment we have for the future of Acura,” Mendel said.“We have done a good job with the SUVs but we have struggled with the sedans,” Mendel said. “There is a lot of recognition that Acura could be and should be a much stronger brand than it is today.”In addition to separating the two brands, Honda also has established the Acura Business Planning Office, which will set the global direction for Acura products. Mendel said Erik Berkman, currently president of Honda R&D; Americas, will become an executive vice president of Honda North America with responsibility for the new Acura Business Planning Office.Earlier this year, Honda said it would discontinue two sedans, the TL and the TSX. It will replace them with the new TLX sedan this summer. The new model will slot between the compact ILX sedan and the full-size RLX sedan in a simplified lineup.The base model will use a direct-injected, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. Expect horsepower and torque figures to be north of 200. This engine will be paired with an all-new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and will be available only with front-wheel-drive.The optional engine will be a direct-injected 3.5-liter V-6 with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Pricing hasn't been announced, but is expected to be close to the $31,530 starting price of the outgoing TSX. Like the TL it replaces, the 2015 TLX will be built in Acura's Marysville, Ohio, plant.ALSO: Why Tesla jilted California as site for battery plant Consumer Reports names Tesla top pick in annual car rankingsFord and Chevy trucks, Honda Accord most likely to last 200,000 miles Follow me on Twitter (@LATimesJerry), Facebook and Google+.

267	"How would you like your iPhone 6? With a 4.7-inch 1080p display, 10-megapixel camera and slimmer build, please. Coming right up, sir. That'll be $649.99.A new iPhone 6 concept design by Sam Beckett, fulfills most of our fondest dreams for Apple's next flagship, but also presents a fairly realistic representation of what we can expect when the iPhone 6 finally debuts. The concept design bears the very clever name ""iPhone Air,"" and features that 4-inch-plus display we've all been dreaming about.In Beckett's design, the iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display with a 1080p resolution and pixel density of 468 ppi. It's not exactly a stretch of the imagination to think that Apple is getting on the bigger display train, especially since several leaks have indicated that Apple is testing multiple display sizes for the iPhone 6. It also makes sense to see this concept sporting a very, very slight, nearly invisible bezel around the display. Recently leaked photos showed the same design idea and it follows the trend set in motion by the iPhone 5, with its very minimal bezels.The iPhone Air concept shows a thinner profile of just 7-millimeters thick. Although it may not be thin enough to earn the title ""iPhone Air,"" Beckett's concept makes sense, so far. After all, Apple probably won't make the iPhone 6 that much thinner, at least not as thin as some of the curved design concepts show. Beckett added a sapphire glass display to his design, instead of the traditional Gorilla Glass. This particular design move is perhaps the most believable, given the fact that Apple has recently pushed to open multiple sapphire glass factories, including one in Arizona.Beckett gave his concept a faster A8 processor and upped the camera resolution for his design, bringing it up from 8-megapixels to 10-megapixels. Otherwise, the iPhone Air concept follows Apple's design aesthetic and doesn't make too many changes, but that is what makes it so believable. Most tech pundits don't expect the iPhone 6 to be revolutionary in comparison with other smartphones that are currently on the market. The most exciting thing about the iPhone 6 will probably be its larger display. Beyond that, not too much is currently anticipated. Of course, it's early yet and Apple has a lot of time to come up with an even bigger wow-factor than its first-ever foray into making a 4-inch-plus iPhone.

Beckett chose this name as he made the concept 7 mm thick, which is 0.6 mm smaller than the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S, but also 8% larger than its predecessor.This iPhone concept has a 4.7-inch sapphire crystal display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, with 468 pixel-per-inch (PPI).“Some extra space could be potentially utilized by reducing the width of the side bezels and by also slimming down the top and bottom of the phone frame too,” the designer wrote on The Verge forums.The photo sensor is upgraded from 8 to 10 megapixels and an aperture of f/1.8.Other features include an A8 chip and a fingerprint sensor.

269	"Want a sneak peek at Apple's iPhone 6? Sure you do, but, sadly, you're going to have to wait a while before Cupertino officially lifts the curtain on its next-generation handset.But don't fret too much. If you're fiending for a look at the next iPhone, we have something that might hold you over for a bit. Designer Sam Beckett over the weekend released an impressively realistic concept video on The Verge forums showing what he calls the ""iPhone Air.""The device Beckett envisioned sports a 4.7-inch sapphire crystal display with a resolution of 1920 by 1080, and 468 pixels per inch, up from 326ppi in the iPhone 5s . The bezels have been scaled down so there's practically no frame around the screen. Beckett also predicts that the next iPhone will have a 10-megapixel camera with an increased aperture of f/1.8 and a faster A8 chip.""I wanted to keep the core design of the iPhone very much inline with what customers expect from Apple,"" Beckett wrote. ""I have given the device the title 'iPhone Air' because Apple has demonstrated that they think the iPhone is a mature enough device to warrant two versions (5s and 5c) and I believe more distinctive branding, much like the iPad Mini and Air will help to reinforce the two product lines.""
While the video is fun to look at, viewers should take it with a huge grain of salt. It is, of course, just one person's idea of what the phone may look like, and has not been endorsed by Apple.Still, the video draws on a number of possibly legitimate rumors that have been making the rounds. Take a look for yourself and let us know what you think of the fictitious iPhone Air.Meanwhile, Apple on Monday afternoon pushed out an update for its iOS mobile operating system, featuring support for the much-hyped CarPlay, improvements for Siri, Touch ID, and more.

270	BEFORE a future iPhone release, rumours and concepts are thrown up everywhere — but this concept might actually be close to the money.THIS may not be the new iPhone you want, but it could be the new iPhone that you get.The next iPhone will not be clear (sorry) and it will not have a curved screen (not sorry). It may, however, be a little thinner, lighter and have a slightly larger screen.The concept comes from British graphic designer Sam Beckett, who has created some impressively accurate iPhone concepts in the past.Beckett predicts that the iPhone Air will have a 4.7-inch display (the iPhone 5S has a 4-inch display), created by making the phone 8 per cent larger and reducing the side bezels. The concept iPhone Air is also 9 per cent thinner than the 5S.In 2012 Beckett, who works for an app developer, made an iPhone 5 concept video that was both accurate and ahead of its time. In the video, he correctly predicts some things about the iPhone 5, like the new dock connector and larger display, and he even predicts some aspects of the iPhone 5S and iOS 7, like the fingerprint scanner and the control centre.Beckett says he believes that the next iPhone will be called the Air, not the 6 because “Apple has demonstrated that they think the iPhone is a mature enough device to warrant two versions (5S and 5C)” and he feels that “more distinctive branding, much like the iPad Mini and Air will help to reinforce the two product lines.”As of right now, Apple has no public plans to release a new iPhone, but the company tends to announce new iPhones in the fall of each year, so there’s still a lot of time to dream up the next iPhone.This article originally appeared on the Huffington Post.A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

271	"Monday, February 12, 2018 | Updated at  3:08 PM ETIn anticipation for the release of Apple's latest iteration of its flagship smartphone, the iPhone 6, designer Sam Beckett has put together a concept video of what we can expect from the new device.Dubbing it, the iPhone Air, Beckett's video is based on the rumored specifications of Apple's new gadget. Beckett's concept sports a 4.7-inch display, with 1920 x 1080 resolution and 468ppi. This is a 17 percent increase in screen size from the iPhone 5S, with 68 percent more pixels.""I wanted to keep the core design of the iPhone very much inline with what customers expect from Apple,"" says Beckett on The Verge.

The smartphone also features a Sapphire Crystal display (rumored to replace the old Gorilla Glass), an improved 10-megapixel camera, and a faster Apple A8 chip.The iPhone 6 is one of several devices Apple is expected to launch this year.

272	The iPhone 6 release rumors are ramping up and that means concept and design videos floating across the internet. An iPhone 6 concept video from Sam Beckett ofThe Verge suggests a potential direction for Apple, an iPhone Air.Beckett created some internet buzz with the video as his suggested iPhone Air brought together many of the iPhone 6 release rumors that have been scattered across the internet. Probably the biggest rumor to date has to do with screen size and the durability of the retina display on the iPhone 6. Apple is in tweaking mode on the iPhone, which could eventually spell trouble for them in an increasingly saturated smartphone market. One thing that Apple does well however, is listen to their consumers and make relevant design changes.One of the biggest concerns with the iPhone 5S release was that there was still more Apple could do with screen size. This iPhone 6 concept video suggests that Apple may increase the screen size by as much as 17 percent and increasing the number of pixels by 68 percent. A thinner design has been part of the thinking in line with the iPad Air direction that Apple has taken. There is some thinking that Apple will only have an iPad Air release this year and not another iPad Mini.Some screen suggestions for the iPhone 6 release have shown a complete elimination of visible edges on the next edition of Apple’s flagship phone. While this design is highly unlikely, the concept video by Beckett does show a more minimalist design than the iPhone 5S. Screen size rumors are not the only thing Apple buyers are interested in. In a fast paced, constantly changing market, iPhone users wanted more speed and quicker processing capabilities. The iPad has already lost considerable ground in the world of tablets and Apple doesn’t want to see the same thing for their phone.There has been a lot of discussion surrounding the development of the A8 chip, to be utilized in the iPhone 6 release. Apparently, Samsung has been cut out of production and now the Tawainese group TSMC is primarily manufacturing the chip for Apple. It seems the A8 and Sapphire glass screen will be the big sellers on the iPhone 6.So when can data consuming iPhone users expect the next generation to be available on the market? According to most recent speculation, the iPhone 6 release date could come sometime in late Summer.[Image via Apple-Singapore]All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.	Science
273	"Monday, February 12, 2018 | Updated at  2:29 PM ETWith the runaway success of the Apple iPad Air -- combined with the anticipation of the iPhone 6 -- the computer giant is gearing up for the iPad Air 2 release... which some experts suggest could be as soon as the fall of this year! According to the U.K.'s MacWorld blog, if Apple's pattern of releasing a new product about once a year continues, we can expect the iPad Air 2 to drop sometime this fall. While it may seem that the iPad Air -- and, if we want to go one step further, the iPad Mini -- only just came out, it's the fact that the first version of the iPad Air was such a success that makes Apple eager to release the new version of its popular tablet. Indeed, Apple has even gone on a hiring spree, which is leading people to speculate that Apple is all-too-eager to get the latest technology out in time for the fall.""Apple Inc. is hiring hundreds of new engineers and supply-chain managers in China and Taiwan as it attempts to speed up product development and launch a wider range of devices,"" the site is reporting. ""People familiar with the matter said the Cupertino, Calif., company is hiring engineers from rival smartphone maker HTC Corp. and other Taiwanese tech firms to build up teams in Shanghai and Taipei.""  So, what can we expect from this go-round of the iPad Air 2? Well, according the International Business Times Australia, the specs for the newest iPad Air shouldn't be that different from the earlier version. Folks are speculating that the bezel-free design, larger screens, high-resolution cameras, and fast processors have become standard for all Apple products, and the iPad Air 2 should be no different. The iPad Air has received mainly positive reviews. Writing for AnandTech, Anand Lal Shimpi writes that the iPad Air ""feels like a true successor to the iPad 2,"" praising it for its reduced weight and size. Shimpi further states that the Air ""hits a balance of features, design and ergonomics that I don't think we've ever seen in the iPad."" Tagsapple ipad air, Apple iPad Air 2, Apple iPad Air 2 release date, When will the Apple iPad Air 2 be released, Apple iPad 2 specs, Apple iPad Air 2 update, Apple iPad Air 2 updates, Apple iPad Air 2 news frank rubio National Hydrocarbons Commission Disney Channel's newest star is adding diversity to the channel and empowering girls her age through her lead role in ""Stuck in the Middle."" 4:44 hassan jameel Get ready for the final matchup of the big tournament.CategoriesCategoriesFollow Us"	Science

  What's coming in the iPhone 6? This concept 
  video from Apple fan Sam Beckett has all the major rumors,
  and his own idea about what it will look like. 

  The design in Beckett's mind is a combination of the iPhone 4 and
  the iPhone 5. It looks nice, but we're expecting the iPhone 6 to
  look more like an iPad Mini, or iPad Air, with a rounded backing.
  We could be wrong, though.

280	"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch iPhone 6 later this year, and designer Sam Beckett has come up with a concept of an ‘iPhone Air,’ which might be similar to the one Apple has planned to launch. The concept iPhone is just 8% bigger than the iPhone 5S, but the screen is 17% larger with 68% more pixels.In the concept design, reported by The Verge, Beckett has kept the screen of the iPhone at 4.7 inches with resolution of 1920×1080 pixels or 468 ppi.Beckett believe that some extra space could be utilized by thinning the bezels on the side, and also by cutting down the top and bottom of the phone frame. The iPhone Air as designed by Beckett is 7mm, which is 0.6 mm thinner than its forerunner.The concept also shows the use of sapphire crystal instead of Corning Gorilla glass, a 10 megapixel camera and a faster A8 chip.  The concept by Beckett is very much similar to the iPhone 5S, which indicates that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be working on the similar line for the iPhone 6.Explaining the designs, Beckett said that the concept iPhone is similar to the customer’s expectation from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He said that some changes have been made in the design because Apple guys think that the “iPhone is a mature enough device to warrant two versions (5S and 5C) and I believe more distinctive branding, much like the iPad Mini and Air will help to reinforce the two product lines.”In order to design new devices, including the iPhone 6, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hiring new engineers and supply chain managers in China and Taiwan. The company is gearing up its product development and planning to launch newer devices.According to the Wall Street Journal, the iPhone maker is poaching engineers from companies like HTC Corp and other Taiwanese tech firms to build up teams in Shanghai and Taipei. Apple is rumored to come up with two larger screen iPhones for this year. According to the analysts, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on releasing more devices similar to competitors like Samsung.The much talked about variants of the iPhone 6 are expected have 4 inch and 5 inches screen display, Bezel free design, remote user interface and sapphire glass.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!

281	Like tech videos? Subscribe to Ubergizmo on YoutubeConsidering how the MacBook has received the MacBook Air treatment in the past, do you think that the folks over at Apple might also do the same to their coveted iPhone range as well? I am quite sure that we are all pretty much well aware by now that there will be another iPhone released in due time later this year, but as to whether it will be known as the iPhone 6 or not, remains to be seen. Right now, what you see above happens to be the iPhone Air concept video, which could possibly be the closest resemblance to what the real deal would look like.The iPhone Air concept was made possible thanks to designer Sam Beckett and his imagination. This particular concept does pitch a rather familiar looking design which houses a near bezel-less 4.7” sapphire crystal 1080p display, a body that measures all of 7mm thin, as well as a mere 8% enlargement of the device compared to the iPhone 5s. Right at the back also resides a 10MP OIS-capable camera.I know, the hardware specifications might not amount to much at this point in time, but considering this is Apple that we are talking about, they have seemed to have lost their competitiveness in this aspect for some time already.

The video also shows the device with 4.7 display (1920x1080, 468ppi) and 10-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/1.8.""This is an idependently animated video for the purposes of visualising potential future hardware concepts,"" reads the disclaimer of the video.Apple Inc. has not revealed the looks of its upcoming flagship smartphone but gadget lovers seem to love the mock up design as many viewers of the YouTube video commented positively.""Have to admit that this looks pretty damn nice,"" commented Tony Robinson.""I could totally see Apple using this or a similar concept for the iPhone 6. Nicely done!"" wrote Don McAllister.""This would have been a bit better if the back had a curved bevel edge like the iPads and iPod touch. I still liked it better than other concepts, though,"" commented CaptainKittyLitter.With a rounded look, the iPhone 6 looks like iPad Mini and iPad Air in Sam Beckett's concept video. However, it's not known if the Cupertino giant will incorporate the designs shown in the video.Conflicting reports have been doing the rounds on the release date of the device with some arguing that it would be unveiled at the WWDC event in June while others say the unveiling would happen only in September.Several reports have claimed that iPhone 6 would have screen made of sapphire crystal glass and Apple has filed for patents like ""Audio call screening for hosted voicemail systems,"" ""Computer User Interface System and Methods,"" and ""Systems and Methods for Preventing Light Guide Plate Scratching Artifacts,"" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, suggestting that it could be incorporated in its new device.iPhone 6 is expected to sport a 4.7/4.8' or 5.5' display with a 1920x1080p (440ppi), or a 2272×1280 (510ppi), powered by A8 chip (64-bit) and run on iOS 7.2. It is also expected to have a 1,800mAh battery, according to South Korean brokerage KDB Daewoo Securities.VIDEO: iPhone Air Concept 2014"	Science
283	It seems like the inevitable next step for the iPhone line, given the warm reception the iPad Air received at launch. But should the iPhone 6 land taking much of its inspiration from Apple's updated tablet design, it sure would be boring.Designer Sam Beckett has put together the convincing concept video above, with the fantasy handset sporting a 17 per cent larger display than that of the 5S, pumping out a 1920 x 1080p resolution to its 4.7-inch screen. 7mm thick (0.6mm thinner than the iPhone 5S), Beckett taps into the regularly-circulating rumour that the next Apple phone will use sturdy sapphire crystal in its display rather than Corning Gorilla Glass, as well as a 10MP camera and A8 chip.It's all very believable, but all rather prosaic too -- the perfect, incremental non-upgrade, as Apple cynics would have it. And that's no slight against Beckett's work, which is excellent, but more on the fact that such minor changes could easily, feasibly be the real deal. It does make you wonder where exactly the iPhone line can go next, highlighting the fact that services, rather than hardware, will make or break the top-tier mobile devices of the future.

284	"The iPhone 6 continues to be a focal point for the technology world, with some rumors becoming generally expected and others remaining mere fantasies. Most agree that the handset will be a bit larger than previous models, possibly up to 4.7 inches in size.Recently there were some allegedly leaked photos of the iPhone 6 screen, but Techno Buffalo, in a video picked up by Huffington Post, explains why it probably isn’t the real iPhone 6 screen. He notes, as have others, that the home button cutout wasn’t centered. The screen does show an edge-to-edge display though, and he suggests that perhaps the component is from a prototype.Mixed in with all the rumors, we’ve seen plenty of iPhone 6 concepts, including a new iPhone Air one developed by Sam Beckett and highlighted by The Next Web. That one covers many of the rumors, like the larger screen, so it could be pretty close to what the handset ends up looking like.But we also have some more fun ones like a concept video which shows the iPhone 6 with a holographic projector, which comes from design studio SET Solution and was picked up by Uswitch. This is a different video than the one which surfaced last year, showing a holographic keyboard and what basically looked like a holographic computer screen.Of course Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fans should note that this concept is so wild that it’s unlikely we will ever see anything like this from the technology giant. The projectors are embedded on both sides of the handset, giving it extra virtual screens when it is placed on a flat surface. The creators suggest that it could even offer “real 3D video games” using the screen which pops up vertically.To control the holographic screens, users just use finger gestures. They can also toss their various screens around and position the as they like. The iPhone 6 in chis concept also features an edge to edge display.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!

285	In the wide variety of iPhone 6 concept videos that hit the web on a regular basis, a new clip stands out for potentially showing a next-generation iPhone concept that actually makes sense, considering Apple’s way of doing things. Designer Sam Beckett has imagined an iPhone that’s slightly bigger than the current model in order to accommodate a larger 4.7-inch display. It’s also slightly thinner, with the designer including it in a new “iPhone Air” family. But overall, the iPhone Air looks like a phone you’d expect to see from the Cupertino-based company.According to Beckett, the phone is 8% larger than the iPhone 5s, and 9% thinner (at 7mm vs 7.6mm for the iPhone 5s), while the display is 17% bigger than the iPhone 5s’. The iPhone Air would have a 1920 x 1080 resolution display with 468 pixel-per-inch (PPI), covered by Sapphire glass. “Some extra space could be potentially utilized by reducing the width of the side bezels and by also slimming down the top and bottom of the phone frame too,” Backett wrote on The Verge forums.Other features of the iPhone Air include a 10-megapixel camera with an aperture of f/1.8 and a fingerprint sensor. Interestingly, Backett included an iWatch-related hint on the display of the device, where a Healthbook app can be seen, which is the rumored name for Apple’s iWatch-related health and fitness application.Apple is rumored to launch at least two iPhone models this year, when it comes to screen sizes. Of the specs imagined for this iPhone Air, the only thing that doesn’t necessarily sound reasonable is the Full HD resolution of the display. In the past, Apple has increased screen resolution in a manner that would not encourage fragmentation when it comes to app development, so it will certainly be interesting to see what resolution the bigger iPhones will actually have, and whether they’d actually get to Full HD.The video showing this iPhone 6 concept follows below.Copyright 2018 BGR Media, LLCPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use	Science
286	"Designers have worked up a projector-toting iPhone concept, giving Apple apostles a glimpse into the kind of ‘what-if?’ radical product design that's unlikely to ever feature on an official product from the House of Cupertino. Traditional pico projector phones’ big USP is that they enable users to project videos and documents onto walls and other flat surfaces, exactly as home movie buffs did way back when. But this concept kit takes a very different approach. Created by design studio SET Solution, the handset features projectors embedded on either side that effectively generate extra 'virtual' screens when the device is placed on a flat surface. That gives you a lot more display space to play with. Best of all, as far as we’re concerned anyway, is that it also offers what it describes as 'real 3D video games', demonstrated in the clip by a 3D-graphics version of those ‘hoop-shooting’ basketball games you find at fairgrounds. The virtual screens, as well as the device, respond to floating finger touch-free gestures that you’ll probably recognise from Samsung’s Galaxy S4, but which have yet to make it over to an iOS-powered smartphone.The handset also allows users to ‘throw’ screens around and reposition them, in much the same way as Microsoft’s concept for living rooms of the near future. Sold? Not sold? For the record, we like it very much. But we’re only too aware that a lasting peace for the Middle East is likely to arrive sooner than Apple would ever allow a phone like this to come to market.

	In the space between one iPhone launch and the next, a number of things happen: rumors abound, analysts throw out predictions on sales figures, specs trickle out slowly, and most entertainingly, designers build out concepts for us to drool over.This is one such concept design, from Sam Beckett, which is actually quite realistic. Meet the promising, yet entirely imagined, iPhone Air.We’ve heard rumors that Apple will be adding some real estate to the display of the next-generation iPhone, and Beckett’s video shows a display that’s 17 percent larger with 68 percent more pixels. Specifically, his concept has a 4.7-inch 1080p display, with 468 pixels per inch.The “iPhone Air” also measures 7mm thick, which is slightly (0.6mm) less girthy than the iPhone 5s. Beckett also suggests tossing out that Corning Gorilla Glass (which has been a staple of the iPhone for so many years) for a sapphire crystal display. Sapphire crystal is the same material used in current iPhones’ cameras, and is responsible for that fun blue/purple glare you get in some photos.Finally, Beckett’s concept uses a 10-megapixel shooter and a faster A8 chip.What’s interesting about the “iPhone Air” concept is that it doesn’t go too far out in terms of design. In fact, it looks almost identical to the iPhone 5s design, with the same TouchId sensor and a similar look and feel in terms of shape.Most concept designers do something more crazy with their iPhone ideas, like curving the entire back of the phone or pulling from iPad designs. But not Beckett. Everything shown in this video seems possible, given Apple’s engineering prowess, though it may affect the bottom line considering the extra costs for these adjustments.Again: This video was not created by Apple, nor were the designs shown within it.[via TNW]Latest headlines delivered to you daily"	Science
288	What will the iPhone 6 look like? We don’t really have a clue yet, though there have been more than just a couple reports suggesting Apple will move to a larger display. A new “iPhone Air” concept – another possible name for the iPhone 6 – was recently created by graphic artist Sam Beckett, and gives a good representation of what the iPhone 6 might look like, especially if Apple doesn’t make drastic design changes.We can see a larger 4.7-inch display with slimmer bezels. Beckett also imagines the use of sapphire crystal, which Apple is manufacturing in a new plant in Arizona, and that would allow for a more scratch resistant screen. TouchID is still right below the screen on the home button, though the back looks a bit more like the iPhone 4/4s than the iPhone 5/5s, with what appears to be a glass sheet. Beckett also says his concept is nine percent thinner than the iPhone 5s, and he imagines a 10-megapixel camera with an f/1.8 aperture. if you look close, you can see a concept of Healthbook is pre-loaded on the device, too.The design is rather conservative – we don’t see a flexible display or anything else, which some of the other concepts have added. We hope Apple’s next-generation iPhone offers a few more changes, even if it does have a bigger screen. Right now we’re expecting an announcement closer to September, when Apple usually refreshes its iPhones and iPads.Todd Haselton has been writing professionally since 2006 during his undergraduate days at Lehigh University.

291	"March 10, 2014A new concept video has surfaced for the mythical iPhone Air. The design, put together by Sam Beckett, takes the typical iterations you find between iPhone versions these days and runs it through an iPhone Air concept machine.What’s the phone look like? Well, an iPhone 5S, which is counter to Apple’s typical release schedule. Lately it’s been a new design, followed by an iterative iPhone with an “S” tag, followed by a new iPhone type of schedule. That puts us square into brand spanking new iPhone territory this time around.Under the hood though the concept seems on point for an “air” iPhone: ” I decided that 4.7″ was an ideal size, supporting a resolution of 1920×1080, that’s 468ppi (up from 326ppi in the iPhone 5S)… I believe the camera sensor will be updated, perhaps to a 10-megapixel sensor and an increased aperture of f/1.8. Other features expected are a faster and more efficient A8 chip.”All in all it’s a realistic rendering without too many liberties taken at the expense of previous Apple iPhones. This is probably the closest thing to a legitimate concept that we’ve seen to date.

292	"The iPhone 6 is among the most highly-anticipated smartphones of 2014 and designer Sam Beckett has made a concept video of an iPhone Air, based on rumored specifications.This is not a real depiction of the upcoming flagship smartphone from Apple, but it gives us a glimpse of how the iPhone 6 may look like when it officially debuts later this year. Using leaked specifications the next iPhone is rumored to sport, Beckett created a concept video of a beautiful iPhone Air with a large display.Apple has so far been quite reluctant in offering larger-screen iPhones. Not too long ago the company made a small jump to a 4-inch screen, bumping up the display size from its previous iPhone iterations with 3.5-inch displays. The largest iPhone screen size so far is 4 inches, but Apple is widely expected to finally take the step to a larger display with its 2014 flagship smartphone.Various recent rumors have tried to anticipate the design and specs of the new iPhone 6, with some reports indicating that the new flagship will be only 8 percent larger than the current iPhone 5S, but would sport a 17 percent larger screen with 68 percent more pixels.In this new concept video, Beckett has envisioned the iPhone 6 just 7mm slimmer, boasting a 4.7-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, crammed at a high pixel density of 468 pixels per inch (ppi).""I wanted to keep the core design of the iPhone very much inline with what customers expect from Apple,"" Beckett explains, according to The Verge. ""I have given the device the title 'iPhone Air' because Apple has demonstrated that they think the iPhone is a mature enough device to warrant two versions (5S and 5C) and I believe more distinctive branding, much like the iPad Mini and Air will help to reinforce the two product line. Some extra space could be potentially utilized by reducing the width of the side bezels and by also slimming down the top and bottom of the phone frame.""Beckett further envisioned the iPhone Air with a faster Apple A8 chip, as well as a powerful 10-megapixel rear camera. Keep in mind, however, that this is a concept video, and is by no means a depiction of a real product. Nothing is confirmed so far regarding the iPhone 6, so treat this conceptual design accordingly. That said, watch the video below to see what the iPhone 6, or iPhone Air, may look like.Sign up for our Newsletter© 2018 Mobile&Apps; Inc. All rights reserved."	Science

Beginning next season, EverBank Field will be home to the largest HD LED video displays in the world at each end zone.Each video board will be more than 21,700 square feet of active display area, which is nearly enough to blanket the entire football field when combined.Per Daktronics.com, who is manufacturing the HD screens:""The two massive end zone displays will each measure 60 feet high by 362 feet wide and feature a 13HD pixel layout. A goal of these displays was to have three side-by-side HD video images for multiple replay shots and other video content.

The displays will have a ""13HD pixel"" layout, so even the biggest content package will have a relatively sharp look.The two end zone panels will be complimented by a suite of other new, smaller displays, including new corner units, new ribbon displays (those strips on the edge of the upper deck at most arenas), and new panels above the stadium tunnels.Now Jaguars fans will have plenty of distraction from the merciless throttling their team is undoubtedly on the receiving end of.Served from: 192.168.10.91 | Version: com"	Science
297	The Jacksonville Jaguars don't exactly generate much excitement on EverBank Field. However, they'll soon have something attention-worthy above that field: a pair of the world's largest LED-lit, HD-capable displays. Daktronics is installing end zone screens at the stadium that each measure 362 ft. wide by 60 ft. high, handily eclipsing the 200 ft. by 80 ft. panel at Charlotte Motor Speedway. All that visual real estate will serve up to three HD replay videos at once, even as it shows the (likely dismal) score.

Ground has been broken at EverBank Field in preparation for installation of the largest video boards of their kind in the world. This project also includes the construction of a new interactive fan area in the north end zone that will reflect the spirit of life in Jacksonville. This new fan amenity will feature a flexible elevated plaza of approximately 42,000 square feet. Project completion of the video boards and the fan area is expected in time for the first home game of the 2014 Jacksonville Jaguars preseason.“As the construction takes shape we can all envision what an impact this will have on EverBank Field and the game day experience,” said Jaguars Owner Shahid Khan, “and that was one of the reasons from the beginning for embarking on this ambitious project. We want EverBank Field to be a world-class destination, and we want to bring energy and attention to Downtown Jacksonville. Our goal is to offer best-in-class amenities and the best in-stadium experience for our fans and for everyone who visits Jacksonville and EverBank Field.”With these video enhancements, EverBank Field will now display approximately 55,000 square feet of video boards, a 660% increase over last season’s 7,200 square feet and the most offered by any NFL stadium. Fans can go to www.jaguars.com/livecam to follow real-time progress of the project.“We owe our fans and this community nothing less than the best, and these enhancements will be the best,” said Jaguars President Mark Lamping. “These stadium upgrades will drastically change the in-stadium experience and create a truly unique environment that you cannot get at home. This will be an eye-opener and an attention-getter for Jacksonville.”Hunt + Elkins, a joint venture, is the construction manager for the stadium project. Hunt Construction Group has previously built several sports facilities including Lucas Oil Stadium and University of Phoenix Stadium for football, and Marlins Park, Nationals Park, Busch Stadium and Citi Field for baseball.Elkins Constructors is a Jacksonville-based construction company, as is Haskell Architects and Engineers, P.A. which is the designer for the scoreboard construction. The Haskell Company will provide structural steel and steel installation services for the scoreboard and north end zone improvements.“Our company built the stadium for the City of Jacksonville at the inception of the Jaguars, opening in 1995,” said Sid Perkins, Vice President of Field Operations for Hunt Construction Group. “We look forward to another successful opening day and showcasing the skills of our very talented staff.”Daktronics is creating the video boards, and Haskell is responsible for the project design. Daktronics is in the process of manufacturing the video displays. Each display boasts more than 21,700 square feet of active display area – almost enough to cover the entire field of play when combined.“We are honored to continue our long-standing relationship with the Jacksonville Jaguars and the City of Jacksonville,” said Mike Kempany, Daktronics sales representative on the project. “Their new game-day experience will be unrivaled as the Jaguars unveil new LED fascia displays throughout the stadium and two of the world’s largest high definition video displays.  The Jaguars are proving their commitment to be on the leading edge of video technology and to the fans of Jacksonville.  Daktronics is extremely proud of our ability to offer these high end systems which will set a new benchmark in professional sports.”“These new cutting-edge video displays and related technological improvements will greatly elevate the fans’ visual immersion and will set the standard for in-venue experience,” said Christopher Holmes, AIA, LEED AP, Haskell’s Project Design Principal. North end zone interactive fan areaAt the north end of the stadium will be a large two-level deck featuring cabana-style seating areas, video screens, bars and two large spa-type wading pools and other water features. There will be sections dedicated to private functions as well as areas open to all fans in the seating bowl. Populous is responsible for the design of the north end zone area.“As the designers of the original stadium and planned improvements over the years, our focus at Populous has always been on keeping EverBank Field looking to the future by creating an experience that will evolve with Jaguars fans. The north deck expansion is an important step in accomplishing this goal and will enhance game day for everyone from general fans to premium patrons,” said Dennis Wellner, Populous Senior Principal. “The experience for fans using the deck will be incomparable; they will have a variety of new offerings on game day that simply don’t exist in other NFL venues.  As a firm, we’re appreciative of having a continued role, spanning more than two decades, in creating and exploring future fan amenities at EverBank Field.”Permanent facilities in the deck area will include men’s and women’s restrooms, food service space and utility boxes for connection to portable amenities. The connections under construction will provide power, data, water and drains for portable bars and food service for fans.In addition, sun shades, seating and other amenities will be provided. These provisions will be portable and removable for the installation of temporary seating for special events like the Florida-Georgia game, the Gator Bowl and concerts. Video boardsThe two massive end zone displays will each measure 60 feet high by 362 feet wide and feature 13mm HD pixel spacing. The video boards will be capable of showing any combination of live action, instant replays, vivid graphics, colorful animations, up-to-the-minute statistics, scoring information and sponsor advertisements.Below the north end zone display will be a display measuring nearly 10 feet high by 320 feet wide featuring the same 13mm HD pixel layout.At the opposite end of the stadium will be two ribbon displays on both levels of fascia in the seating bowl below the south end zone main display. Each ribbon display will feature 15mm HD pixel spacing. The top display, measuring more than 3 feet high by 365 feet wide, is curved to appear the same length as the bottom display, which will measure more than 3 feet high by 295 feet wide.Each side of the field will feature a ribbon display along the seating fascia, each measuring more than 3 feet high by 573 feet wide and featuring a 15mm HD pixel layout.Four new displays will replace the existing displays in each corner of the stadium. These new displays will each measure approximately 18 feet high by 32 feet wide and feature a 15mm HD pixel spacing. Two additional displays will be installed above each tunnel at opposite corners of the stadium. These displays will each measure 6 feet high by 24 feet wide and will also feature a 15mm HD pixel layout.All of these video and ribbon displays will provide the opportunity to present up-to-the-minute statistics, fantasy football updates, out of town scores and other game day information. All displays will incorporate excellent image clarity and contrast, and will provide multiple levels of protection from the elements. The wide angle viewing capability will provide fans with a clear view of the displays from any seat in the stadium.Daktronics will also be including its powerful Show Control System with this installation. This industry-leading system provides a combination of display control software, world-class video processing, data integration and playback hardware that forms a user-friendly production solution. Steel structureThe new scoreboards will be constructed of structural steel framing with ribbed metal siding and a single ply roof over rigid insulation on metal roof deck. The bowl side of each structure will be the electronic video board. Each new section of scoreboard will be supported by triangular structural steel towers similar to the existing supports. The design will include the electrical service for the video board operation, lighting of the interior spaces and lighting for the signage to be provided on the back side of the scoreboards.The installation includes power, cabling, sound and a new expanded state of the art scoreboard control room on the west side suite level of the stadium. They started demolition on the north end zone #Jaguars pic.twitter.com/mpTlPJloXh About Hunt + ElkinsHeadquartered in Jacksonville since 1955, Elkins Constructors is a premier commercial contractor providing services throughout the Southeast.

The move is much more likely than Glass to make wearable devices part of the average person’s daily life, since it will allow developers to use the SDK to create all kinds of sensor-laden gadgets–smart watches, clothing, earrings, whatever–on their own timelines and budgets and with their own sense of style (Glass, on the other hand, costs $1,500, is extremely obvious-looking, finnicky, and still not publicly available.)Google already did this kind of thing once with smartphones: Android arrived in 2008 and was the only OS aside from Apple’s iOS that managed to expand and capture a huge chunk of the market. With Google’s existing expertise in mobile software and developers’ familiarity with Android, a wearable SDK would require relatively little investment for a potentially big payoff if wearable gadgets grow as expected over the next several years (and this makes it even more likely that more developers will try their hand at making wearables, since many are already familiar with Android).Reportedly, Pichai didn’t mention if Google is building any of its own non-Glass wearables with the SDK, but I’m willing to bet one of my plastic Android toys that, beyond its experimental contact-lens project computer project, there are some things in the pipeline (a smart watch has long been expected, at least, and could be revealed at the company’s next developer conference in June).Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.Rachel Metz Senior Editor, MobileAs MIT Technology Review’s senior editor for mobile, I cover a wide variety of startups and write gadget reviews out of our San Francisco office.

303	"Google will make it easier for third-party developers to create Android-based smartwatches and fitness bands, the company said today at the South by Southwest Conference (SXSW).Google is a huge player in the wearable device market with its Google Glass product, although that device has garnered almost as much negative press as accolades, since it was released on a test-basis last year.However, Android has not made much of an impression with smartwatch and fitband makers, but it hopes to correct this situation by releasing a software developers kit (SDK) in about two weeks' time. SDKs give developers all of the technical background needed to properly use the Android operating system in their products, making it easier to create apps.Sundar Pichai, Google's senior VP of Android, Apps, and Chrome, said he expects the wearables market to develop in a similar fashion as the smartphone market. There have been reports that Google will roll out its own smartwatch later this year.The move could come just in time, as consumer interest and knowledge of wearables such as smartwatches, fitness bands and smart glasses has reached 52 percent, according to the NPD Group's new ""Wearable Technology Study."" ""[Some] 52 percent of consumers say they've heard of wearable technology devices such as smart glasses, smart watches, and wearable fitness tracking devices. Among those aware of the devices, one-in-three say they are likely to buy one of them,"" the research firm found.Smartwatches have a somewhat higher level of recognition among consumers than fitness bands, with 36 percent of those surveyed saying they had heard of smartwatches. On the negative side, only 23 percent said they intended to purchase such a device.Smart glasses awareness is also quite high, due mainly to the excellent level of press received by Google Glass. Among early adopters, smart glass awareness is nearly 50 percent. Making and receiving calls (19 percent), browsing the web (19 percent), and taking photos and videos (19 percent) were most commonly cited by likely buyers as sought-after features, NPD said.There are still problems that are keeping wearable products from broader adoption, though. NPD analysts noted that people believe smart glasses can easily be broken and that most smartwatches are too large, unattractive and have a short battery life. Fitness bands also suffer from an image problem with consumers citing many of the previously mentioned problems and adding in that they fear they will lose interest in the device.Sign up for our email newsletter today.Tech Times' biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.By clicking on 'Submit' button above, you confirm that you accept Tech Times Terms & ConditionsSpaceSecurityEarth/EnvironmentVideo GamesApps/Software

	While Google is rumored to have its own Nexus-branded smartwatch on the way, possibly by the time Google I/O kicks off in June (if not earlier), the SDK is designed for use with other smartwatch makers using the wearable focused Android OS.
	Using an Android powered smart jacket as an example, Pichai also said at SXSW that its wearable Android SDK is not just for smartwatches but for wearables of all sorts. He said the company is releasing the developer kit well ahead of hardware release dates in order for Google to fine tune the system. Many have suggested this could be as much for developers of other wearable devices at it is a beta run for Google's own smartwatch technology.
	Beyond that, Pichai also mentioned some interesting developments that could be on the horizon for the recently acquired Nest Labs. Google is is thinking about some kind software ""mesh layer"" over the existing system that will better allow its various devices to communicate with one another.

306	"The Chromecast has become a popular little device. Despite talking about it so much and recommending it endlessly, we can’t really claim too much credit for that. But according to Sundar Pichai, head of Android and Chrome, the Chromecast has sold “millions” of devices. No solid number was given, but that’s impressive nonetheless.Even launched in a single market with limited functionality and neutered developer support, the low price and ease of use captivated many. Plug the little dongle into a spare HDMI port and outlet, set it up with your smartphone, and you can suddenly stream supported media from your Android or iOS device wirelessly. The fact that it worked with iOS devices probably helped move units as well.Recently, Google has opened up the SDK to developers. This has resulted in quite a few apps integrating Chromecast support, offering more streaming options for users. This $35 dongle is far more useful than it ever has been. However, there is still a way to go. With more support and Google’s improvements this device can become even more popular. How many of you own a Chromecast? How many of your friends bought one?Via: PhandroidI own two and gave 6 of them for Christmas presents last year.Jeez, that’s awesome!You and your friends should checkout http://www.streamchromecast.comThese are awesome little devices, and for the price they can’t really be beat.Glad to own one.I wrote an app named “castontv” for this device.If you have a chromecast and you’re not using http://www.streamchromecast.com you’re missing out huge.Wow this app is a god send!!! I was home sick today and spent all day streaming in full 1080p with not a single dropped connection!!Thx for sharing!!!!!!Someone should develop an app that you click on/off from a widget and then any app that you open, that streams video, once in full screen instantly casts it.This as a way to be able to cast apps like CBS that you can only watch on phone/tablet.Love mine.

308	"AUSTIN, Texas, March 10 (UPI) --  Google will launch an Android developers kit for wearables, according to Sundar Pichai, head of Android and Chrome, while speaking at the SXSW conference Monday.While Pichai did not say whether Google itself will develop wearables, he did say that the kit will help developers create wearable devices that run on Android. Google, according to Pichai, is presently focused on looking at wearables from a ""platform level,"" positioning the company as a stakeholder in wearable technology without having to build their own wearables.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });
Pichai said that he sees similarities between the smartphone ecosystem and the wearable system. While smartphones are becoming smaller and more powerful computers, wearables are becoming a nexuses of an array of sensors. He sees Google being able to provide a way to standardize how these sensors interact with Android, which will save many developers the hassle of having to create custom operating systems.""We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,"" Pichai said. ""They need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together.""Pichai stated that Google's focus still remains on smartphones -- be it the sub-$100 phone or a premium smartphone -- and that the company is looking for ways to connect to the next billion users.Apple has made its foray into the auto industry with CarPlay, and Pichai noted that many people will choose to stick to Apple's iOS. But he likened this approach to entering a hotel room and realizing the in-room stereo system only works iOS devices.""They're probably losing at least half of their users,"" he said.

AUSTIN—Google wants to provide a framework for wearables the same way it has for smartphones and tablets. During a talk at South by Southwest on Sunday, Android head Sundar Pichai said an Android SDK for wearables is coming down the pipeline in two weeks, and will give developers the tools they need to make Android-based smartwatches and fitness trackers.

Pichai said Google thinks of wearables in terms of sensors that need to communicate to be helpful for users. “We want to build an API so these sensors can work together,” he said.

Watches and activity trackers are the most obvious wearable categories that developers can begin working on, but Pichai said Google wants to offer an Android framework that goes far beyond traditional form factors.

“When we say wearables, we think about it as a much broader conception,” he said. “[But] that’s for partners and developers to figure out. We are thinking about it as software… a jacket one day with sensors. I don’t know.”

The wearables SDK follows on the heels of the Android for cars initiative that Google announced at CES earlier this year. The two are related, Pichai said, because Google thinks in terms of a unified software ecosystem. That extends to its new acquisition Nest, too.

“We see an ecosystem for all these devices,” Pichai said. “We want to develop a set of common protocols so they all work together.” 

Will Glass soon have a stablemate in Google's wearables line-up? Pichai wasn't telling.

Of course, by releasing an SDK in short order, Google creates an essential feedback loop. In essence, third-party developers can seed Google with helpful data before the company announces any home-brewed wearables of its own.

And you can breathe a sigh of relief, Google+ haters: No Google+ account will be required for your new Android-based wearables to function.

Will we see Google-branded wearables? Maybe. Pichai said Google has ventured into phone and tablet manufacturing to show partners like Samsung how the ideal device marries hardware and software. But Pichai also said Google doesn’t want OEMs to think Google is giving itself an unfair advantage.

“What makes a platform successful is having the discipline to make sure that everything Google can do on top of a platform is something that other people can do as well,” he said.

Pichai extolled the virtues of Android’s open nature and pointed to Nokia and Amazon’s Android devices as examples of how companies can build on top of the platform without baking in Google’s own services—though that’s also an option. Hardware manufacturers can twist and mold the operating system to the extent that users don’t even realize they have an Android device.

Many so-called low-end Android devices were on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, but even the sub-$100 phones are increasing in quality, Pichai said.

“There are phones for every segment and the quality of these phones are pretty good,” he said. “The impact of that is huge I think.”

Now that Android phones and tablets are well-covered territory, we’re expecting other Google to shift focus to other form factors at its upcoming I/O conference. Pichai predictably hinted at little of what the company will announce in June, but it looks like car tech and wearables are top priority.

311	"Yesterday, at a SXSW panel, Google's SVP of Android and Chrome, Sundar Pichai, announced that Google will be releasing a developer SDK for wearables in a couple of weeks, The Verge reported. Pichai made no mention of whether or not Google itself would be working on its own wearable devices, but did say that the company's focus on the emerging product category would be at ""a platform level."" This likely means Google will provide the programmable software meant to equip wearable sensors with an operating system (Android), instead of building the wearable devices itself.""We'll lay out a vision for developers as to how we'll see this market working,"" Pichai said at the event.The announcement indicates that Google is putting its stake in the wearables market, which first of all is indicative of its significance as a product category. But beyond that, having an Android SDK for wearables will incentivize developers looking to create brand new devices. That, combined with the unending slew of Android smartphones and tablets means the OS has a good chance of solidifying itself as the go-to platform for a rich, mobile experience.Even with all this talk of wearable tech, however, Pichar was silent on the matter of Google's own rumored smartwatch. Only time will tell how these two pieces of news will play out."	Science

			Trending:		MOUNTAIN VIEW — Google’s plans to release free Android-based software tools for wearable technology will accelerate the delivery of smart watches and similar devices into the mass market within the next year, according to tech analysts.Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst in Forrester’s application development and delivery group, counts four Fitbit activity trackers among his family, along with a Pebble smart watch that his son wears at MIT.So Hammond believes the rush to wearable technology “is already moving pretty fast.”  But Google’s announcement, he said, has the potential to “push wearable technology into mainstream acceptance. It can’t do anything but accelerate an already fast-moving space.” Google’s Android operating system already powers most of the world’s smart phones, and now Google is borrowing a page from its own playbook that could speed up development of wearable technology, including Google Glass and Google’s planned smart watch.At the South by Southwest conference Sunday, Google announced it will release an Android-based software development kit for wearable devices within two weeks, leading Al Hilwa of IDC to predict that “the era of wearables (will) see its heyday beginning in the first half of 2015.”Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research was even more bullish.“The world could be very different six to eight months from now,” Chowdhry said.  But Bob O’Donnell, founder and chief analyst with TECHnalysis Research, was wary that Google’s success with Android-based smart phones and tablets can be translated into wearable devices because of the challenges of converting smart phone technology into something as small as a wristwatch.“Most watches are less than two inches diagonally that you look at several feet from your eyes,” O’Donnell said. “With something that’s that dramatically cut down, you cannot possibly leverage any existing applications. You have to start completely from scratch. It’s going to be a completely different animal than Android.”Google already has invited developers to use elements of Android in developing apps for Google Glass, Hilwa said. And some niche wearable devices already on the market, such as the Pebble and Fitbit, use their own unique operating systems, O’Donnell said.Whatever hardware results from Google’s software development kit also will have the additional problem of attracting ads to screens much smaller than current smart phones and tablets, which continue to struggle to generate ad revenue, O’Donnell said. “How many apps can you launch on a screen that’s only two inches big?” he said. “And you can’t possibly put ads on a screen that small that anyone can see.”Contact Dan Nakaso at 408-271-3648.

314	AdvertisementAdvertisement By Lewis LeongMar 10, 2014ShareMore Android-based apps are coming soon to wearable devices, announced Sundar Pichai, Google’s Head of Android. An Android-based development kit will be released in two weeks time so developers can begin making apps.Google Glass is currently the company’s only wearable device, though a smartwatch is allegedly in progress. By releasing a development kit, Google is allowing its Android platform to be used on devices from any manufacturer. Competitors like Samsung have smartwatches running the company’s proprietary operating system. This means only Samsung wearables will have that operating system.Google, however, will allow any wearable device maker to use their operating system. Android took over the mobile phone market using the same strategy and this development kit can help Google dominate the wearable market as well.Last month, Google released its Chromecast development kit, triggering a flood of apps supporting the streaming media stick. With the release of the development kit for wearables in two weeks, we can expect to see more apps for smartwatches and other wearables soon.Source: Ars TechnicaNext storyHow to become a brand ambassador on InstagramAdvertisementAdvertisementShare Files - when it worksCompact BitTorrent client with expansive capabilitiesKeep internet-based attacks at bayThe quickest, smartest browserA Free Phone Manager, With An App Downloader, Manager And Installer PlatformAdobe Reader 11: the essential PDF viewerAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAbout UsDevelopersPartnersUsersSitemaps:Softonic in:The name and logo of Softonic are registered trademarks of SOFTONIC INTERNATIONAL S.A.Copyright SOFTONIC INTERNATIONAL S.A. © 1997-2018 - All rights reservedAdvertisementWe use own and third party cookies to improve our services and your experience.

316	Having succeeded at making Android the most common platform for tablets and mobile devices versus cult favorite iOS, Google is now looking towards the next mobile tech frontier—wearables—for expansion of its platform.Sundar Pichai, Google’s SVP Android, Chrome and Apps, took center-stage at SXSW to compare the evolution of smartphones to that of wearable devices, indicating that Google would release a software development kit in the next two weeks for developers to integrate Android into apps for wearables. “We’ll lay out a vision for developers as to how we’ll see this market working,” Pichai said, according to The Verge. “We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together, they need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together.”[more]With the goal being to migrate Android to a multi-screen world, buzz is getting louder around Google’s rumored partnership with LG to create a smartwatch, which some expect to be revealed during Google’s I/O conference in June. The OS is based on Google’s Now voice assistant and search feature, both drivers of the core functions of Google Glass.But while smartwatches may be the first wearable device rage, Google has set its sights on a robust range of offerings such as a “smart jacket” with sensors. “When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform,” said Pichai. “We see a world of sensors… Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.”  Talk moderator and entrepreneurial investor John Battelle pushed for details of Google’s Android licensing program, which has stringent requirements for third-party developers, but Pichai defended the platform. “Android is one of the most open systems I’ve ever seen,” countered Pichai. “What makes Android great is it’s literally designed from the ground up to be customised in a very powerful way…If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it’s not exclusive—you can preload any other services you want.”The openness of Android’s platform will determine just how far it will be applied to this new category of devices, much like how Samsung is using the Tizen OS in its updated line of smartwatches and fitness band. A Q Score, or Q-Rating, is a methodology used in the United States to measure the familiarity and appeal of a brand, read more:	Science

keynote presentation at SXSW that the company will be expanding the availability of Chromecast into more markets. Pichai stated that Chromecast — which is $35 USD HDMI streaming media player — will be coming to “many more countries” in the next few weeks.Canadians have been wanting Chomecast to arrive on Google Play since it was announced last July, but we’ve been limited to Amazon or 3rd party sellers. Pichai didn’t indicate which countries are on the list, a previous report indicated that the UK and Australia will be next, and hopefully Google will consider Canada.As for sales, Pichai also declared that they’ve successfully seen “millions” of units sold.Source: TNWVia: GigaomFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinRedditFeatured ArticlesSign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inboxThank you for your subscriptionRelated ArticlesFeb 9, 201810:52 AM ESTJan 16, 20186:07 PM ESTJan 12, 20186:05 PM ESTFeb 9, 201811:37 AM ESTCommentsCategoriesContact usSocialNewsletter SignupThank you for your subscription © 2018 mobilesyrup.comPrivacy.

318	"While Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt talked about robots everywhere, the company's boss for Android and Chrome, Sundar Pichai, has disclosed that there's more to Google than just Glass when it comes to wearable technology.Speaking at the South by Southwest  Interactive (SXSW) conference on Sunday in Austin, Pichai disclosed Google's plan to roll out a software-development kit (SDK) in two weeks time so Android can crawl into smartwatches, fitness gadgets, and other wearables.  ""In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables,"" said Pichai. ""When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors... Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.""Pichai discussed how Google wants to develop a common ground for all of these sensors so protocols can be established and products can communicate and work together.Just as what Android did for smartphones and tablets, it can create sort of a ""big bang"" for wearable technology that can pave the way for millions of wearable device applications and possibly other kinds of wearable gadgets.The company is launching the SDK well ahead of the plans to roll out other wearable devices so it can get enough feedback and also help developers visualize what the search engine company plans to do in the wearable technology niche.""I think we're just scratching the surface. Android is one of the most open systems I've ever seen. What makes Android great is it's literally designed from the ground up to be customised in a very powerful way,"" Pichai said. ""We do have business relationships, we do do licensing relationships and people want to use Google services on top of Android. But in theory you can use Android without Google. If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it's not exclusive - you can preload any other services you want.""Having a good platform to start on and tapping the help of the whole developer community, manufacturers will lighten their load and can focus on developing more hardware as the baby industry of wearables crawls and evolves.Pichai told the audience at SXSW that Google has sold millions of units of the plug-in device Chromecast in the United States. The $35-gadget that can stream music and video to any compatible HDTV will also be rolled out this year across global markets.He also touched on Project Ara, comparing the modular smartphone into application programming interfaces (API) for hardware that will enable consumers to build their handset according to their needs.Asked about Nest Labs, Pichai did not directly say that consumers will be required to have a Google+ account to make the most of Nest products but clarified that the company is looking at ways to have connectivity into the Google ecosystem.The Google executive did not disclose more details about the SDK for wearable devices and most likely it will be rolled out without too much fanfare.Having a tool to develop apps for wearable devices will certainly boost the industry but it will not be a walk in the park for Google, especially with Apple around and other manufacturers using Android on other devices that now look to have a certain distance from the platform to develop their own identity as a brand.Sign up for our email newsletter today.Tech Times' biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.By clicking on 'Submit' button above, you confirm that you accept Tech Times Terms & ConditionsSpaceSecurityEarth/EnvironmentVideo GamesApps/Software

319	Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is getting serious about the trend in wearables, according to reports from Bloomberg and The Verge. The company is releasing software tools for developers, making it easier for them to begin developing apps for wearable devices.The company hasn’t given any hints as to whether it is working on any new devices, but Google’s senior vice president, Sundar Pichai, who’s in charge of both the Android and Chrome teams, said he is thinking of wearables at “a platform level,” suggesting the company has the expansion of its Android operating system in mind.Pichai said that the new Android software tools will be available in the next few weeks and will address more devices than just a wristwatch computer. Additionally, he hopes that developers will build a myriad of new apps for more devices than just smartwatches. Pichai notes that “when we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly,” per The Verge.The market for wearable computers, Bloomberg notes, is expected to reach $20 billion in sales by 2016.Pichai discussed Google’s plans to expand the use of its OS beyond its smartphones and tablets at SXSW. He touched on the company’s desire to be included in a number of different cars in coming years, noting that while most car manufacturers are sticking with Apple’s iOS, “they’re probably losing at least half their users,” by limiting themselves to just the Apple operating system, per CNET.Pichai also referenced how powerful sensors are becoming a more ubiquitous technology following the advent of a whole new lineup of fitness devices. He spoke to The Verge about how Google would like to standardize the way those sensors send their data to the Android operating system, which would conveniently also “allow device manufacturers to opt for Android instead of a custom OS.”Though the VP didn’t talk about any wearables in the making, it stands to reason that Google’s efforts to expand Android’s relevance to the wearables market could hint at the possibility that a Google smartwatch on the way, The Verge notes.

320	"ByDavid Chirico David Chirico Google’s Sundar Pichai has been all in on announcements at SXSW, revealing Google’s plans to launch an Android SDK for wearables in two weeks and now revealing that Chromecast will launch in other regions this month, moving out of the United States.The Chromecast has been a US only device for a heck of a long time. We originally heard Google would be launching it oversees before the end of 2013 and then the date was pushed back to March 1, but both have turned out to be false.We are not sure what is taking Google so long considering the biggest feature on the Chromecast is the ability to stream from Chrome’s open tabs, making almost every service compatible unless they strictly side against Chromecast.Support for Chromecast may be minimal at the present time, only Netflix, Google services, Hulu, and a few others offer dedicated support. However, if the service is not supported, as long as it works on the web, it will work on Chromecast.Chromecast is also being worked on to offer the experience on Android and other mobile platforms, meaning almost every type of service will be available to use on Chromecast. This could make it a tool to beat Apple and Roku TV, who both do not offer this deep level of integration.Chromecast is a small USB, for those unaware, that plugs into the back of the TV and acts as a connector to the TV screen from any computer. Google won over many fans with the $35 price tag and the integration with Chrome, something we haven’t seen on streaming services so far.We are not sure how well the Chromecast has sold in the United States, but considering the device was sold out for the first few months, it would be odd to think Google has had low sales. The streaming stick may not be as popular as the Roku or Apple TV box, but it is getting close.UK and Australia look to be the first countries to grab Chromecast and sell it in stores. We have already seen plenty of small stores on Amazon crop up offering Chromecast’s for £50,and they ship the product over from the United States for a higher price.We will be glad to see Google officially get the product into the UK and Australia, lowering the prices and possibly opening even more markets in the near future. We hope Google looks for local integration with popular networks, and in the UK’s case we could see Virgin Media or Sky hop in on a deal.On Thursday, the uncertainty surrounding the technology of autonomous vehicles showed as automakers and suppliers gave...Despite being under new owners, PSA Group, Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said he will remain in...General Motors is planning to replace their Buick Regal sedan in the United States with the...A little over a year after their emissions scandal, the largest automaker in the world is...Shiro Nakamura, responsible for pinning some of Nissan’s most daring and memorable vehicles, has announced his...On Monday, Intel Corp. said it struck a deal to buy Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV for about...The annual International Geneva Motor Show, one of the world’s most prominent auto shows, demonstrated a...After a temporary set-back in December, Uber Technologies Inc. can now legally put its self-driving cars...At the Geneva auto show on Tuesday, Bentley surprised everyone with wheeling out their all-new electric...Lexus’s newest hybrid sedan, the LS 500h which debuted Tuesday at the Geneva auto show, is...

321	Google’s head of Android and Chrome, Sundar Pichai, who attended SXSW Interactive tech fair, made an official announcement: Google will release the SDK for Android-powered smart wearables.The aforementioned Google representative said that, in about two weeks, the Mountain View-based phone maker will release the SDK for those who want to develop smartwatches, smart bands, or any other Android-powered accessories. Even though Pichai didn’t mention what smart wearables will be released by Google in the near future, he said that some time, even the coat we wear will be full of sensors and run Android.Sundar Pichai said though that Google’s own smart wearables must first be tested, then presented to third-party manufactures, before they will be effectively launched on the market.For what it’s worth, the rumor mill speculates that Google will introduce its own Nexus smartphone (which will reportedly be manufactured by LG) in the fall, when the Mountain View company is also expected to announce it’s next-gen Nexus smartphone, the unofficially dubbed Nexus 6.Android 8.0 Oreo Firmware Officially Available for Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ (Update guide included)Samsung Launches Galaxy On7 Prime in India With Samsung MallFacebook Starts Suggesting New Users To Enter Name As Per Aadhar Card in IndiaOPPO F5 6GB RAM Version With 6-inch 18:9 Display Launched in India for Rs.24,990Vivo V7 With 5.7-Inch 18:9 Display, 24MP Selfie Camera Launched in India For Rs 18,990OnePlus 5T vs OnePlus 5: What’s Changed?Oppo F5 With 20MP Front Camera, 6-Inch Bezel-less Screen Goes on Sale in India For Rs 19,990How to Update LG Q6How to Boot Fastboot Mode on LG Q6How to Enter Download Mode on LG Q6How to Hard Reset the LG Q6Install Android 8.1.0 Oreo February 2018 OTA Update Manually for Google Pixel 2 XLHow to take a Screen Capture on Samsung Galaxy A7How to Capture a Screenshot on Samsung Galaxy A5Update Sony Xperia Z5 Compact to Android 8.0 Oreo via Lineage OS 15How to Take a Screenshot on Samsung Galaxy A3How to take a Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Screenshot© Android Geeks - Android News, Update, Root & How ToAndroid is a trademark of Google Inc.

324	"With wristband fitness trackers, smartwatches and other tech wearables gaining massive traction, Google will be making it easier for developers to create these types of devices for its Android platform.Sundar Pichai, Google senior vice president of Android and Chrome, announced at the SXSW conference in Austin on Monday that the company will release a SDK (software developer kit) later this month, The Guardian reports.

325	"ByDavid Chirico David Chirico Sundar Pichai has been on a roll of announcing and revealing information on Android the past few weeks, something he has not been known for in the past few years. The Android and Chrome chief recently spoke up about Chromecast coming to other regions and has revealed that a wearable SDK for Android will be released in two weeks.The timing of this news is rather reactive, considering Samsung just switched its Gear lineup from Android to Tizen OS, its own platform built with Intel. The move was seen as a cut from Samsung, possibly knocking one big manufacturer off the table when Android for wearables becomes big.The wearable SDK for Android will be available for manufacturers who want to build watches and bands, we suspect. Google is not preparing to launch its own SDK for Glass at the moment, and that type of wearable may be another factor the company has to look at whenever Google Glass get an official release date.We have also heard multiple reports of Google launching its own smartwatch with the help of LG, possibly at the Google I/O event. The Android smartwatch SDK will help Google show a standard and guidelines for manufacturers to follow in terms of design and functionality, something it has done with the Nexus smartphones and tablets.The new Android smartwatch SDK includes a lot of Google Now functionality. Considering devices will be a lot smaller, the move to voice recognition is even more apparent on smart watches than it was on smartphones, allowing users to use applications without using the touch-screen.Apple will apparently be heavily integrating Siri into iOS for its smartwatch platform and will push developers on iOS8 to update their apps for the iWatch. It is harder for Google to push this on developers considering the vast amount of different screen sizes and adoption of skins.Sundar Pichai did not say any current Android manufacturers were building a smartwatch with the new SDK, although we have heard rumors of the HTC smartwatch integrating heavily with Google Now, possibly pointing to some companies getting early access to the SDK.On Thursday, the uncertainty surrounding the technology of autonomous vehicles showed as automakers and suppliers gave...Despite being under new owners, PSA Group, Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said he will remain in...General Motors is planning to replace their Buick Regal sedan in the United States with the...A little over a year after their emissions scandal, the largest automaker in the world is...Shiro Nakamura, responsible for pinning some of Nissan’s most daring and memorable vehicles, has announced his...On Monday, Intel Corp. said it struck a deal to buy Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV for about...The annual International Geneva Motor Show, one of the world’s most prominent auto shows, demonstrated a...After a temporary set-back in December, Uber Technologies Inc. can now legally put its self-driving cars...At the Geneva auto show on Tuesday, Bentley surprised everyone with wheeling out their all-new electric...Lexus’s newest hybrid sedan, the LS 500h which debuted Tuesday at the Geneva auto show, is...

326	Posted on March 10, 2014 in MobileGoogle may be commonly associated with Google Glass, one of the most striking, and perhaps strangest, wearable devices out there. But where development of new wearable technology is concerned, the fun is just beginning, a top Google executive said Sunday.Wearable gadgets aren’t just smart versions of glasses or watches, but also anything that embeds sensors that can collect data and deliver it to devices that can then better serve their users, said Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Chrome, Android and apps at Google. And where that broader wearables market is concerned, “we are just scratching the surface,” he said.Pichai discussed wearables and all things Android in an on-stage interview with author and Federated Media founder John Battelle at SXSW Interactive in Austin, Texas, on Sunday.It is often easy to forget that Google isn’t necessarily a hardware company. It partners with manufacturers to make smartphones and tablets under the Nexus series and also has a manufacturer build Google Glass for it. Chromebooks with Chrome OS are made by partners. When the Motorola sale to Lenovo becomes official, Google will be officially out of any part of the hardware manufacturing game.See also: Google To Release Android Software Developer Kit For WearablesWhich means that if and when Google comes out with a smartwatch, it will be in conjunction with some type of manufacturing partner. The rumors now are pointing to a Google smartwatch in conjunction with LG to be announced at its Google I/O at the end of June. In the meantime, Google will make a play to dominate the wearable world in the same way it does the mobile world with a new software developer kit for Android to be released this month. “In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android [wearables]. That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working,” Pichai said. “When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors. Sensors can be small and powerful and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.”Google doesn’t think of wearable gadgets as just smartwatches, fitness bands, or Google Glass, Pichai said. Any type of wearable technology, be it sensors embedded in your jacket or your shoe, is the target Google is shooting for. It is the essence of the connected self that Google wants, and it needs developers to build the applications necessary to achieve that reality.Pichai did not say how long Google has been working on the wearable SDK, but Apigee developers Prabhat Jha and Ed Anuff figured that Google could put together a skeleton SDK (like the initial one Google released for Chromecast recently) in two weeks or a fully featured one in about six months. The question of how long Google has been working on the wearable SDK is pertinent after Samsung ditched Android for Linux-based Tizen in its new Gear 2 and Gear Fit smartwatches.Is Google just reacting to Samsung, or has it long planned to release an SDK intended to dominate the wearable space? We will learn when the wearables SDK drops in a couple of weeks and software developers give us their impressions on its depth and capabilities.Pichai also discussed Android at length, although his spiel on the subject hasn’t evolved much. To wit: Android is open-source and freely available to anyone and has great benefit to manufacturers and developers because of its massive scale.“Android is one of the most open systems I’ve ever seen. What makes Android great is it’s literally designed from the ground up to be customized in a very powerful way,” Pichai said. As with any mega company with a platform that affects millions upon millions of people, Google gets its fair share of speculation, gossip and general interest into what actually happens with Android. What does Google think of Amazon and Nokia’s use of Android? Is Android really free? What kind of stipulations does Google give its business partners? What is really the relationship between Samsung and Google like?See also: Sure, Microsoft Could ‘Fork’ Android—But It Would Be A Huge Waste Of TimeAmid all that speculation, Pichai sat down to … reaffirm the official talking points Google has laid out for Android.“Nothing that we do is ever exclusive,” Pichai said about Android licensing agreements and placing Google services on devices from hardware manufacturers like Samsung or HTC. “We do have business relationships, we do licensing relationships and people want to use Google services on top of Android. But in theory you can use Android without Google. If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it’s not exclusive—you can preload any other services you want.”Pichai and Google will insist forever that nothing nefarious is going on with Android. They respect users privacy, they are not racketeering manufacturers into Google Mobile services and so forth. The Android Open Source Project is open to all that wish to use it. Google Mobile Services is a contractual agreement where Google’s apps get pre-loaded onto manufacturers’ smartphones.This is the essential white and black of Android, and neither Pichai nor Google will go into what individual business contracts look like with each one of its partners. When it comes to Android, Google sets performance and design standards and benchmarks and will be involved in the quality assurance testing of mobile devices. How manufacturers customize devices and what they pre-load onto it is of less concern to Google than making sure that the Google apps and cloud integration are present.Tags: Android, Android SDK, app development, Google, smartwatch, Sundar Pichai, SXSW, SXSW 2014, wearablesIf you thought the idea of using your voice to control your smartphone was neat, just wait.

327	I’ve written before that the current state of smartwatches is reminiscent of the earliest Android tablets, before Google released a proper version of Android for larger screens. While some companies are trying to make Android-based smartwatches already, their efforts seem premature without Google’s guidance.That support is reportedly coming soon. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google plans to a wearable software development kit based on Android in two weeks:Google plans to release its own smartwatch, which will be manufactured by LG Electronics. But as with the Nexus line of smartphones that Google makes, the company wants to help lay out a “vision” for other developers to power their own wearable devices.The LG-made smartwatch is just a rumor at this point, but CNet has claimed that it will debut in June with Google Now as a centerpiece.

In an interview at SXSW, Sundar Pichai, Google's head of Android, Chrome, and Apps, announced that Google will be jumping into the wider wearables space with an Android-based SDK focused on wearable devices. The new SDK will be released to developers in just two weeks with the hope of getting feedback from them. And like Android for smartphones, Google will be developing a device-agnostic app platform for wearable computers.
While it's easy to imagine this platform as ""Android for watches,"" Pichai said the company was thinking ""more broadly"" and, according to the Wall Street Journal, pitched an idea for a jacket with tons of sensors. Google is rumored to be working on smartwatch of its own, but Pichai declined to say if Google is working on any devices. Instead, Pichai said he thinks about the wearables market at ""a platform level."" This ""platform"" idea move perfectly mirrors Android's strategy in smartphones and tablets, where Google licenses the OS out to other OEMs to produce hardware, and Google uses its influence over the software to drive people toward Google services.While on the surface it would make sense for Google to launch a wearables platform in the same vein as Android, this outcome wasn't a foregone conclusion. Google's other wearables project, Google Glass, is definitely not a platform that is welcoming to outside manufacturers. With Glass, Google is going the Apple route with a closed-off, fully vertical device where Google controls the hardware and software. None of the special Glass parts are shared with outside developers or OEMs. Google accepts app submissions for Glass, but it strictly controls what is and is not allowed in the Glass store—for instance, facial recognition apps are banned for no reason other than the fact that Google doesn't like them.It was easy to imagine the Glass OS being the future of Google's wearable strategy. The minimal, low-resolution, voice-based OS could have translated easily to a watch. But with the release of a proper Android SDK, Google Glass is looking less like ""the future"" of wearables at Google and more like a one-off, siloed experiment.Further ReadingThe 2014 Google tracker—Everything we know Google is working on this yearA proper Google wearables platform should mean that Google will finally start making wearable-focused apps. The biggest problem with wearables so far, like Google Glass and the Samsung Galaxy Gear, has been a lack of useful apps. Google is one of the biggest mobile app houses in the world, and a wearable with interoperability with services like Google Now, Gmail, Google Maps, Hangouts, and Play Music would go a long way toward creating a compelling device.Work on an Android-based wearable has been going on for some time. In the summer of 2012, Google bought WIMM Labs, a company that was the furthest along in developing an Android smartwatch. By the time it was bought by Google, WIMM had built an Android smartwatch, watch-focused SDK, and app store. According to reports, WIMM merged with the Android team and has been working on a Google smartwatch ever since.Internally, Google has been doing its part, too. Over the last few versions, the company has been slowly grooming Android to become a viable wearable device OS. In Android 4.3, Google added a notifications API which can push notifications out to secondary devices and allow the secondary device to dismiss notifications and perform actions on the notification, like archiving a Gmail message. While third-party devices have yet to take advantage of this functionality, it could theoretically allow a perfect replication of the notification panel on a smartwatch. The Galaxy Gear relied on notification support from individual apps, but with Google's OS-level implementation, all apps would be compatible. The small size of wearable devices also means that Android will need to run on an even smaller power budget, so for Android 4.4, Google focused on shrinking Android's memory footprint. Today Google says the OS can run on 512MB of RAM. For comparison, the Galaxy Gear uses 512MB of RAM, and Google Glass has 1GB.The big question is how the OS will work in relation to the main branch of Android. Is it a customized fork, like Google TV or Google Glass, or is the OS part of the main branch of Android, the same way smartphones and tablets are? Tablets started out as a separate version of Android (Honeycomb) and later merged with the main phone branch in Ice Cream Sandwich, so we may have to wait a version or two before we get our answer.Google needs a solid Android wearables platform to come out as soon as possible. The company has already lost its biggest Android customer, Samsung, to a rival operating system in the wearables market. With the newest Gear smartwatches, Samsung switched from Android to its own Tizen OS, so it seems like wearables will be the first battleground where we see a proper Tizen versus Android fight. Google's timing with this project couldn't be better. As we've seen with smartphones, the platform with the most apps wins, and Samsung has just blown up whatever app catalog it had when it switched to Tizen. Now with Google jumping into the wearable app development fray, any developers considering a Tizen app are probably wary of another switch by Samsung to Google's platform.The good news is that we only have to wait about two weeks to see if Google's smartwatch platform is worth switching to. Like Android for smartphones, it looks like Google's wearable OS will be the only manufacturer-agnostic option for some time. This ""horizontal"" strategy almost guarantees it the largest install base, which, along with Google's app development, guarantees it the best apps. The Android smartphone situation may yet repeat itself.You must login or create an account to comment."	Science
329	"Sundar Pichai, head of Android and Chrome for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), said Friday at SXSW that the company will release an SDK, or software development kit, for wearable devices by March 23. Earlier reports had said that Google would announce a new version of its operating system for wearable devices, followed by the introduction of a Nexus smartwatch made by LG Electronics.An SDK is used by app developers to create programs. Pichai said that the SDK would allow developers to write Android software for use in smartwatches and other wearables, contrary to earlier reports that said the company would release an entirely new OS for the smaller devices.""In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android … that will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working,” Pichai said on Sunday in Austin, Texas.According to Pichai, the goal is to take Android beyond smartphones and tablets to a connected world consisting of multiple screens. Google is also expected to unveil a Nexus-branded smartwatch during its Google I/O conference in June.The wearable SDK will likely focus on Google Now, the company’s digital personal assistant capable of making phone calls and giving updates and messages through voice. Google Now is used by the company’s computing headset, Glass, as well as Motorola’s Moto X smartphone.Pichai said that Google wants to create APIs for the many sensors that the company sees popping up on everything from wearable devices like a Nexus smartwatch, to car dashboards. He said that current car tech, which often only works with Apple devices, likely causes manufacturers to lose half of their users.Wearable technology, along with in-car infotainment systems, is expected to be the next major battleground in the tech industry, as Google goes up against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in devices based on the companies’ mobile computing products.Follow Reporter Thomas Halleck on Twitter @tommylikeySubscribe"	Science

Google is diving into the Internet of things with plans for developer kits for wearables, CNET reported.Sundar Pichai, who heads Google's Android and Chrome, announced on Sunday that the Android software developer kits would be available in two weeks, according to CNET.The tech giant is looking to develop wearable devices ""at a platform level,"" said Pichai, as reported by The Verge.Google could present its Android system as a wearables platform, which would further the brand without involving Google in actual product development.""We'll lay out a vision for developers as to how we'll see this market working,"" Pichai said, according to The Verge.Google hopes to become the standard for wearables, which are ""becoming nexuses of an array of sensors,"" according to The Verge. The company is looking to develop standardization across wearable devices so developers will decide to use Android instead of a custom OS.""We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,"" Pichai said, ""they need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together.""The Google official also hinted at the implementation of Nest, the Internet of things startup that Google purchased earlier this year for $3.2 billion.While the maker of smart thermostats and smoke detectors should stay as its own distinct brand, it brought a strong line of products and a killer design team to Google, Reuters reported at the time.Google is looking to develop a platform that will let multiple wearables work in sync, Pichai said.""We are thinking hard about the layer which will connect all these devices together,"" Pichai said, according to CNET.

333	How close are you with your best friend? Do you consider them to be a part of the family? Blood may be thicker than water, but true friendships can produce a very deep emotional connection. As a result, when one ends, it can be quite difficult for some to cope with this loss.Are you experiencing this right now because a friendship has ended? Here are some suggestions that may help to ease the pain you are in.Are you the same person you were ten years ago? Five years ago? Last year? We all change and that can alter both our interests and attitudes. Sometimes a bond between friends that was extremely strong can just fizzle out and be no one’s fault. When this is apparent, it is better to let a friendship fade rather than struggle to keep it afloat.Is there a gift from your friend that holds particular significance for you? A picture of the two of you together? While you should keep such memories, this might not be the best time to display them. Put these things away for the time being.It might be painful to think about the current situation and you may not feel motivated to write about it. However, putting your pain down on paper can help. Also, when you revisit these pages, the subject often does not seem as intense and this can be a step in helping you to move on.You may not understand the reasons why, but there comes a time when you need to understand and accept that the friendship has ended. If the other person has opted not to stay in touch, you need to honor their wishes.Here are some other thoughts on this subject:Aging can be difficult. Both our minds and bodies are no longer as spry as they used to be. Our fresh and youthful looks give way to sagging skin and a weather-beaten appearance. Also, the longer we last, the more likely it is that we will outlive friends and loved ones. It is quite easy to feel lonely as we get on in years, particularly if our physical conditions reach the point where mobility becomes a challenge. Those of us who lived independently for decades often find it tough to accept that they will now need the help of others to accomplish basic tasks.Even if life manages to go fairly easy on us in these regards, we can also live through the decline and loss of a beloved partner or best friend. This can be especially tough if the healthier person assumes caregiver duties.Seniors in long-term care facilities can also find it very difficult, particularly if they are among the younger people there. Cognitive decline, understaffing, poor food, varying degrees of care and attention, and lack of interesting interaction and activities can also bring about depression, even in someone who entered in good spirits and health.Fortunately, there are good options for anyone in this situation. First, they should visit their regular doctor for a check-up and recommendations. The GP can then refer them to a therapist who specializes in working with seniors and their challenges. Talk therapy can be an excellent way to work through problems and formulate solutions.Group therapy also brings about good results for many people. The chance to meet with other people going through the same struggles can be very helpful and even lead to lasting friendships.If need be, psychiatry is another option. Psychiatrists use methods similar to therapists, but can also prescribe anti-depressant medication to supplement therapy sessions.It doesn’t matter whether you are dating in your teens or in your 60s: it can be quite expensive. A meal at a quality restaurant can run well over $100 and even a night at the movies will set you back about $40, if you can’t resist the temptation of the snack bar.When all is said and done, dating is not about where you go, it’s about the time you spend together. And you can absolutely have a nice time just staying put.Here are some ideas for stay at home date nights that go beyond just “Netflix and Chill”:Most couples usually have one partner who excels at cooking and one that…doesn’t. This is a great opportunity to work together creating a lovely meal for the two of you. The half who loves cooking can provide tutoring.Both life and entertainment these days are so fast paced, it can be quite refreshing to sit down to an old school board game like Monopoly. Bring out an old favorite from childhood or try one you haven’t played before.Do you love to sing, but are mortified by the idea of doing it in public? Wail to your heart’s content at home with no one but your patient spouse to hear you butcher classic songs.Love the idea of camping, but hate dealing with the weather, insects, and wild animals? Try setting up a small tent and sleeping bags in your living room. You can use the fireplace as your camp fire, toast marshmallows, and do all of the other things you would normally do outside without all of the hassle.These are just a few basic ideas to get you started. Bottom line: the true magic of an evening usually revolves around the people involved and the connection they share.It can be a big decision to decide that you require therapy. However, that still leaves the issue of finding a therapist. This can seem quite daunting as there are usually a number available to you. In a way, choosing a therapist is not so different from selecting another service professional. Here are some tips that will help to make the process easier for you:Have any of your friends or family ever been in therapy? Ask what sort of the therapist they saw, their opinion of them, and whether they would recommend that you also try this person. You can also access online reviews, but make sure that you also study the therapists’ backgrounds. Some therapists specialize in a particular form of treatment, while others feel they have the experience to help a variety of clients. If there is a particular issue plaguing you, it is wise to start with therapists who claim to specialize in treating that form of problem.When you have made your choice, call and speak to them on the phone. This is your chance to ask questions about what a typical session is like, their success in helping people with your issue, and what the fees are. If you are happy with the answers, go-ahead and try an appointment.First appointments with a therapist can be quite intimidating. It is common for clients to be a bit reserved at first as they decide on whether or not they have a relationship with the therapist that will allow them to be open and honest.If the appointment does not go well in your estimation, do not hesitate to try someone else. It is common for people to switch therapists if they do not find one to be satisfactory, and therapists understand that completely. In fact, most would encourage clients to see someone else if they feel they are not getting their money’s worth.Do you worry about staying mentally sharp as you get older? Very few people are as sharp at 90 as they are at 19, but that is a normal circumstance of getting old. Fortunately, you do not have to necessarily succumb to such issues, even if there is no actual way to completely prevent them. Doing any of the following will help to keep you mentally sharp and none of them require much time or effort.Many people in search a quick mental fix will load up on coffee or soda that is full of sugar. While this may be a short-term solution, studies have shown that your memory suffers when your body has chronically elevated sugar levels.While being alone may provide a nice opportunity to get some reading done, if you really want to keep your brain engaged, you need company. Spending time with friends and loved ones means that you are engaging in conversation, celebrating, playing games, and often doing things that require a good measure of brain activity.Exercising is not just for your body! Physical activity can also help to keep your brain in shape, believe it or not.We all know that alcohol destroys brain cells, but you have no doubt gotten drunk and then felt no different afterward. The problem is that all of those lost brain cells add up over the years, so you end up having lost quite a few by the time you are older. We are not saying to quit drinking entirely, just cut back a bit.It is common for people to worry, but doing it excessively is not good for your mind as it causes you stress. It can also prevent you from pursuing activities that improve your mental well-being and growth.“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.” — Dale CarnegieMany of us complain nowadays that we are too busy…and that may well be true. Excess work and lack of proper rest are bad for both body and mind. However, that fantasy you have every workday around 2:00 when you wish you could be sitting by the ocean sipping margaritas and watching the waves might not be great for you either.Here are some reasons why it is actually good for you to be at least moderately busy:Sitting around may be good once in a while, but ultimately, your brain is not getting the kind of stimulation it needs to come through for you on a regular basis.Even if you are just doing your regular routine, there is a good chance that you are learning new things and acquiring new skills.Most of us spend so much of our lives doing things that feel like a waste of time. When you are busy, you are out there getting things done and feeling accomplished.See above. No time to be bored when your plate is full.If you are genuinely busy during the work week, a holiday means more to both body and mind.If there are things weighing on your mind that cannot be solved in the here and now, that can be very difficult to deal with. However, if you are busy, such worries have to be put aside for the time being, in favor of things you can address and problems you can solve.Have you experienced a midlife crisis? In movies, this is always depicted in such extremes as a staid businessman suddenly buying a super expensive sports car and ditching his wife for someone 20 years younger. In reality, most people who do experience middle age problems don’t have such a reaction, but it can nonetheless remain a challenging time, particularly if you are looking for answers and don’t know where to turn.Here are some things to keep in mind during periods like this:Any time in life can cause people to become uncertain about the future, but this issue seems to increase in middle age. Don’t assume that a mild health setback is automatically a sign of cancer, and don’t think that money woes now guarantee you will spend your twilight years in abject poverty.While climbing the ladder of life, it is common to put off things. You’re busy with work, so you put off spending time with your kids, traveling, or doing other things that can help to enhance you as a person. Now is the time to reshuffle your priorities and get caught up. If it means making up a bucket list, go ahead.Even if you are in the C-suite at your company, know when it is time to turn off your smartphone and enjoy your evenings in peace and quiet. If your company so badly needs someone to be on watch at all times, find a subordinate to assume this duty. Should there be a genuine emergency, then that person can contact you. Otherwise, they can handle it for now and you will have a look in the morning.You could be dead. Pretty much anything is better than that, right?Everyone ages, though the effects of aging differ from person to person. No matter how diligent we are, our bodies and mental faculties gradually decline and things that were once easy become progressively more difficult.How well a person accepts these changes can also vary. People who were fiercely independent for most of their lives often have trouble coping with the fact that they need assistance later in life. They may also find it tough to accept that they cannot do the sorts of physically challenging things that were once easy for them.Psychological difficulties at this point in life can also arise from other factors that one normally encounters in life. Losing a partner, friends, or children can easily cause someone with no previous mental health concerns to develop depression and/or anxiety problems.Psychologists working with this population employ a number of strategies that have proven effective. These include CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), talk therapy, anti-depressants, behavior modification, disease management strategies, and health promotion through regular exercise and proper diet.Things can be especially difficult for adults living in long term care facilities. They often feel isolated, sad, and unable to relate to those who also live there. It is important for relatives and friends to visit them whenever possible and keep close tabs on their condition. If anything seems wrong, they should immediately report it to the head nurse or facility director, and then follow-up to make sure that corrective action has been taken.While psychological difficulties may be more common for people in their golden years, they do not always have to be debilitating. It is up to people who work with this population to accurately diagnose when issues are present and then take proper steps to rectify the problem(s). That will help to ensure that people can live out their remaining days with a degree of dignity and happiness.Home movies have been around for the better part of 100 years. However, they were not so simple or economical at first. Anyone could own a 16mm film camera and shoot movies that way. The cost of the film and the developing charges could be considerable, however. Eventually, the smaller 8mm and Super 8 formats helped to bring down the cost, and both the cameras and projectors were smaller.Consumer grade video cameras became prevalent in the 1980s, with people first shooting on Beta and VHS. Other more compact formats came along, like VHS-C and Video 8. Both the cameras and tapes were cheap by this point, and the convenience of video resulted in some people accumulating many tapes of home movies. Digital eventually replaced analog via DVD-R and digital files, both of which have some advantages over analog videotapes.So what of all those tapes from the ’80s and ’90s sitting in people’s basements? Unfortunately, they are all deteriorating. No format lasts forever and even properly stored videotapes will degrade over time. That means even lower quality for a picture that already does not live up to high definition standard of today. However, memories can be irreplaceable, so it would be a shame to lose that 35 year-old footage of your daughter’s acting debut in the school play or your son’s first time on the football field.You can buy a VHS/DVD-R recorder and transfer the contents of the tapes to DVD-Rs. Unfortunately, the market for these devices has declined in recent years, so they are becoming harder to find. There is also the alternative of having the tapes transferred by a professional video service. These are not hard to find, but if you have a large number of tapes, the cost can be quite high (the charge is often $25-40 per tape).Don’t take too long to decide. Those tapes are not getting any younger and your precious memories could end up lost on an unplayable VHS.Anxiety is something that we all live with at one time or another. However, for most people, this form of fear and unease is usually over with after a short period of time. Chances are you did not enjoy the way you felt while in the grip of anxiety; now imagine what it is like to spend most of your waking hours dealing with just such a problem.People suffering from anxiety disorder find themselves plagued by constant worry and negative thoughts. They typically feel a loss of control in their lives and may even experience panic attacks, which are physically debilitating.Here are some things you can try that will help you live with anxiety:While your anxiety might seem like a mild problem, there is the potential that it can become more serious and even life-threatening. If you experience anxiety regularly, it is wise to see a therapist for an an evaluation. Should you find that your therapist is not a great fit, try another one.Anxiety can even cause someone to not accept help overcoming their anxiety. Do not let fear defeat your desire to live a happier life. If your therapist thinks you should try medication, do so. If he or she requests that you join a therapy group, try it. Even just the fact that you are working on solving the problem can help to alleviate some of your anxiety.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a way of stopping those negative thoughts before they overwhelm you. Clients are taught to challenge these thoughts whenever they occur and then through a series of questions, they can come to the realization that the negative thought is not rational and can be dismissed. Done on paper initially, CBT eventually becomes a process you do automatically in your head. Technology is increasingly a part of almost everyone’s life and a large percentage of the population now has a smartphone. Children seem to become tech savvy at younger and younger ages now and they are asking their parents for smartphones at an age when most of us would have been content to own a tape recorder.Do you have a child asking you for an iPhone? Are you curious about what is the appropriate age for such a device? According to Influence Central, some kids are getting their first phones by age 10 and, occasionally, even younger.Part of the problem that comes from determining an appropriate age is that no two children are alike. Some children demonstrate maturity and responsibility from a young age, while others can take considerably longer to successfully demonstrate comparable advancement.We all know (possibly on a very personal level) how addictive smartphones can be. Parents sometimes have great difficulty getting their kids to do their homework and chores already; give them a phone and the situation will likely become even more problematic.There is also the fact that smartphones can give children access to just about anything on the internet, if the phone plan includes data. Certain filters will block out content on home computers, but parents can have a much harder time policing what their kids are watching on phones.The cost of the device is also a factor. While certain cases provide adequate protection for day-to-day use, smartphones are not toys and may not stand up to the amount of wear and tear a child can put them through. There is also the fact that kids do not demonstrate the same level of thought about where they put their phones, so it could become lost.From a science standpoint, the prefrontal cortex does not finish developing in humans until they are in their 20s. Its functions are related to impulse control; children and teens simply do not possess the same degree of control in that area.All in all, my advice is to adhere to licensing rules: don’t let your child have a smartphone until they are old enough to get a license and drive a car.If you are of a certain age, you may find yourself conferring with similarly decrepit friends about the state of the weather these days. Chances are, you have found yourself saying something along the lines of, “I don’t remember there being such extremes in weather when I was a kid!”Climate change has definitely made the weather more unpredictable and, at times, downright fiercer. The last couple summers in Ontario probably left you parched: brown lawns were the norm on every block. By sharp contrast, this year has seen a tremendous amount of rain in the province. That means everything is lovely and green, but you had better keep an umbrella with you at all times. I can’t recall a season where things have alternated so rapidly between sunny and rainy. Meanwhile, our friends on the west coast in British Columbia continue to suffer through a prolonged season of disastrous fires that are claiming homes by the dozens.Dubbed by Environment Canada as the “Year of the Big Wet,” 2017 has certainly been a soggy one. Between April 1st and July 11th, rain fell on 71 of those 102 days, which seems more like a forecast for a Brazilian rain forest than the Great White North.This can’t be a good summer to be a hiker or a drive-in owner as there have been few totally sunny days; it seems like rain always makes an appearance at some point. So, how have you been dealing with all of this extra moisture? I’m tempted to say that you should go jump in the lake (don’t take that personally), but it’s not safe to swim in the rain. Have you been staying inside more? Or are you one of those people who not only don’t mind getting wet, but actually rather enjoy it? Tell us in the comments!Society And Religion	Science
334	"With wearable devices becoming popular – and every major manufacturer rumoured to be preparing their own – it was only a matter of time before Google released an SDK specifically to support Android on these new form factors.Sundar Pichai, Senior Vice President at Google, told the South by Southwest conference on Sunday that the company plans to release a SDK for makers of Android wearable devices within the next fortnight.Google is fast becoming a household name in wearables with ‘Glass’ – the company’s augmented-reality spectacles. This is undoubtedly in no small part due to its widespread media coverage...The device, which isn’t even available yet to the wider-public, is already gathering decidedly mixed opinions – especially in regards to privacy and ‘style’ of the device.For Google, a ‘Smart Watch’ is a much safer bet than eyewear. These convenient devices were made popular by the Kickstarter-success, Pebble, who at the start of this year unleashed a new version with a more approachable ‘Steel’ style.Rumours pit Google as working with the manufacturer of most of the Mountain View-based company’s ‘Nexus’ line of smartphones and tablets, LG, to create a Google-branded smartwatch. It seems a likely scenario; if not simply as backup or to act as a “gateway drug” to the world of wearable devices to the wider-consumer.Chromecast, which Pichai also made a strong emphasis on having sales “in the millions” and coming to more countries soon; alongside Glass; shows Google’s interest in moving beyond web services and into own-brand physical hardware… A move likened to “software-maker” Microsoft with their Surface hybrid device line-up.Both Microsoft and Apple, as Google’s competitors, are both said to be preparing their own plays into the smartwatch market for their respective platforms; Windows 8 and iOS.It makes sense for Google to want to get the jump ahead of these two and set the standard for any future Android smartwatches to come. It would also help to boost Google’s main source of profit; their services; and provide consumers with the benefits of the company’s ecosystem.For example; It’s easy, and exciting, to imagine Google wanting to put ‘Google Now’ on your wrist available at-a-glance…However, Pichai did say: ""When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly. It’s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket with sensors – I don’t know.”Recently Google acquired Internet of Things-darling, Nest. It’s not a long-shot for a web company as big as Google to want to be the platform for this new-generation of connected devices.With Android devices of all shape and forms out there, and 81% market share, it’s a unique opportunity…Do you think we’ll see a Google smartwatch this year? If you are interested in wearables, please visit IoT Tech Expo Europe in London's Olympia, December 2-3 2015.This will only be used to quickly provide signup information and will not

 It was reported on yesterday that Google executive Sundar Pichai told the South by Southwest conference Sunday that the company plans to release in two weeks a software development kit based on Android for makers of wearable devices, such as smartwatches. Google plans to release its own smartwatch, which will be manufactured by LG Electronics. Smartwatches are among the first wearable computing devices, but Pichai said that Google hopes its software platform will help developers create many types of wearable devices. He threw out the possibility that one day, Google's software would be used in a ""smart jacket"" with sensors, reports the Wall Street Journal.  Last week Patently Apple discovered a Motorola patent application that was published by the U.S. Patent office. The patent which was found listed under Google patents, covers a wearable device that is clearly illustrated as a watch. The patent filing notes that ""embodiments of the invention can provide a telephone keypad, for example, that is disposed along the strap of a wearable device, and that uses no electronics whatsoever. Since the strap is constantly flexing, the lack of electronic parts afforded by embodiments of the present invention is highly beneficial and results in enhanced reliability, usability, improved style, and more aesthetically pleasing form factors.""   The design as noted below uses a strap based on an ""air chamber"" concept that could conform to the user's wrist. Moreover, the patent filing notes that ""When the pliant material of the strap is stretched, such as may occur when the strap is stretched tightly about a user's wrist, this can be used to launch applications to monitor health conditions or to launch other applications. In one or more embodiments, these applications require the electronic device to have good contact with a user's skin.""  In another area of the patent filing, it's noted that touching certain parts of the strap will be able to launch specific applications.   On the other hand, Google has been known to slap their branding on other OEM designs like their Nexus line. In this case we know that Google will be using LG to manufacture the watch and an LG patent for such came to light in early January.  CNET reporting from the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona last month reported that ""the actual smartwatch itself will make its debut at its Google I/O conference in June."" Apple's Current Position on Wearables  Recently Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal that ""Maintaining secrecy is important because talking about the future gives competitors a road map of Apple's plans and the company is 'getting ripped off left, right and sideways.""  A case in point would be the whole smartwatch rage. The current explosion of interest in ""smartwatches"" was truly ignited by the revelation that Apple had a patent pending invention on record a little over a year ago. Thereafter rumors of every kind popped up all over the net for those jumping on board. If Apple is just thinking of something cool in a patent filing, the ""fast followers,"" that we know as copycats, go into high gear – even if they don't understand where Apple is going with the concept. These companies know full well that they could simply play a word-game with the press that plays off of Apple's patent pending innovations and score easy PR points ""sounding innovative.""   So where does Apple stand on the coming wearables revolution? During Walt Mossberg's interview with Tim Cook at the D11 conference last year, he touched on the Nike FuelBand which he was wearing and said it was a great device focused on one thing.  ""I would say that the ones that are doing more than one thing … there's nothing great out there that I've seen. There's nothing there to convince a kid that has never worn glasses or a band or a watch or whatever, to wear one. At least I haven't seen it. So I think that there are lots of things to solve in this space, but … it's an area where it's ripe for exploration; it's ripe for all of us to get exciting about. I think there'll be tons of companies playing in this."" Cook added that ""I see it as something that's another very key branch of the tree.""  Further on, Cook noted what he felt was important in this space: ""… you first have to convince people that it's so incredible that they want to wear it. Because where you two guys are wearing watches [Mossberg and Kara Swisher], if we had a room of full of 10 to 20 year olds and we said everybody stand up that has a watch on, I'm not sure anybody would stand up. I don't see it. If you look at what kids are wearing …. Their watch is this [pointing to an iPhone].""  Whatever Apple is working on, they're setting the bar very high and it's not going to be a watch like Samsung's Gear or the one Google is to launch in June. Apple knows that they're not the first in this space. Yet like the MP3 player space, when Apple walked in with the iPod, Apple's iTunes Store and a new approach to buying music, they created an entirely new user ""experience."" Something that the late Steve Jobs was adamant about delivering.  That's not what we're likely to see coming from the Android camp anytime soon. Then again, maybe Google will surprise us this time around. In the coming weeks and months we'll see if Google is able to think beyond the obviousness of what a digital watch should be. Though if there's anything we can count on, it'll be Google trying to drown out anything Apple has to say at their developer conference in June. So expect the circus to really get crazy this June as both camps try to impress tech crazed fans around the world that they're the ones that really have their finger on the pulse of innovation that you care about.  About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.  Other Google Watch Concepts could be found on Google Images

It could be a jacket...with sensors – I don’t know,” he said.

Just because Google plans to make its own smartwatch doesn't mean developers have to avoid Android when making their own. In fact, it'll be a relative breeze to use the platform in just a few short weeks.Google is planning to release a software development kit (SDK) later this month that will make it easier for manufacturers to power their future smartwatches with Android.
During a South by Southwest conference speech March 9, Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai announced the search giant's intentions to dominate the wearables market much in the same way it has smartphones.To accomplish this task, Google plans to borrow from its own Android playbook by making a free SDK available to manufacturers and developers, part of the company's ""vision"" for a wearables market where its mobile OS is on everyone's wrist.Google is reportedly working on its own smartwatch to be manufactured by LG that could debut in June, but Pichai calls the early release of an Android wearable SDK an opportunity to get ""plenty of feedback"" in advance of the annual Google I/O conference.But smartwatches may be only the beginning as Pichai teased the possibility of other wearables such as a ""smart jacket,"" which could incorporate sensors for a variety of unspecified uses.Pichai also told SXSW attendees that Google's Chromecast will soon branch out to countries other than the US after racking up sales ""in the millions"" there.The Android, Chrome and apps executive also answered a query about Google's recent Nest acquisition, saying it could deliver a future ""mesh layer"" of software designed to help devices interact with each other.Via The Wall Street JournalGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

340	It seems that Google‘s Sundar Pichai isn’t done making big revelations at SxSW today. Just after pre-announcing a wearable device SDK coming in two weeks, the Google exec has now disclosed that the company was able to sell millions of its immensely popular Chromecast dongle.Anyone doubting how big Chromecast is should probably take a look at TIME Magazine’s top ten gadgets of 2013. Not only did the device sell out just a day after it became available for purchase, it has started a new trend among streaming devices as well. After all, who can beat a small device the size of a thumbdrive that can stream videos, music, photos, and even browser tabs to an HDMI-enabled TV?Things are about to get even better with the Chromecast. Google has finally unleashed the Chromecast SDK to developers and has also rolled out the official Chromecast support in Google Play Services. This opens the floodgates to even more content sources and uses for the little dongle, like casting photos from Dayframe, or mirroring your Android device’s screeen. That’s not counting the other content providers who are just now also hopping on board.Although not entirely a revelation, Pichai once again reminded the audience that Google wants to bring Chromecast to more markets around the world. So even if Pichai’s rather vague “millions” estimate wasn’t accurate, Chromecast could very well reach those numbers when it hits international markets.VIA: GigaOM	Science
341	"Google has sold “millions” of Chromecasts, according to Android and Chrome chief Sundar Pichai. In addition to the sensational news of Chromecast sales, Pichai also noted at SXSW there would be an Android SDK for wearables coming soon. It fits a previously leaked timeframe, but little else was said for Google’s version of wearable software.Though Pichai didn’t note exactly what the SDK would entail, he did say it wasn’t solely for smartwatches. According to him, Google’s idea is that the SDK will be built by them, saying it would be Gogole’s “vision for developers of how we see this market working”. but Developers and OEMs will have the option to pick and choose what to use. That makes it a more cross-platform option for wearables in general, and frees interested OEMs up to hardware development.Pichai did give a solid timeline for a wearable SDK from Google, which is rare. Though he didn’t give specifics as to what the SDK would include, he did say it would arrive n two weeks’ time. While some expected a whole new operating system, it sounds as though there will be a simple SDK, at least for now. Many believe the smartwatch will be based on Google Now, so perhaps Developers will now have access to a Google Now SDK — something many have pined for since the launch of the Search skin.Chromecast sales are interesting, but the little plug-in heading to more countries is much more important. The Android SDK for wearables is a potentially big deal for tiny devices, and could do for smartwatches and other wearables what Android did for smartphones. We’ll be looking forward to an announcement from Google later this month.Source: The Next Web

Last month UK retailer Currys claimed the Chromecast would arrive to the UK starting as early as March 1st, though Google later reported they had no firm plans to announce. Luckily, for those looking to get your hands on the Chromecast in markets outside of the United States, the wait may almost be over.During Sundar Pichai’s SXSW keynote, the Google exec revealed that the Chromecast is on its way to “many more countries” within the next few weeks. Although specific countries weren’t mentioned, recent rumors have suggested the device will at the very least hit Australia and the UK. Here’s to hoping that Google also has plans for many more markets across the globe, such as Canada, select markets in Europe and Asia.Not sure if you’d even be interested in the Chromecast if and when it officially arrives to your market? Be sure to check out our full review to get a better idea of what to expect from the dongle.What do you think, interested in picking up the Chromecast, at least providing that it’s pricing is as aggressive as it has been in the U.S. ($35)?

ESTDec 16, 20171:44 PM ESTMar 10, 201412:10 PM EST3 commentsAndroid has already graced numerous wearable products, including the first-generation Samsung Galaxy Gear and two generations of the Sony Smartwatch. But Google’s head of Android, Sundar Pichai, told a SXSWi crowd that the company will release a wearable SDK in the next two weeks, making it far easier for third-party developers to create apps using the platform.Pichai’s goal from this expedition is to make Android work flawlessly with a number of sensors, hardware beyond just the regular smartphone retinue like accelerometer and proximity sensor. While Android has proven to be extremely extensible across a number of screen sizes and product categories, Google’s yet to provide developers a set of guidelines, like they did for smartphones and tablets, to create better wearable opportunities.What the SDK will look like remains to be seen, but it will no doubt make the Android experience, across all devices, better for everyone. Google is thought to be working with LG on a smartwatch, which will perhaps be announced during Google I/O in June. Whether it comes to fruition this year or next, it’s clear Google is marching to the same wearable beat as the rest of the industry.Source: EngadgetFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinRedditFeatured ArticlesSign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inboxThank you for your subscriptionRelated ArticlesFeb 9, 201810:52 AM ESTFeb 8, 20181:23 PM ESTFeb 6, 20186:34 PM ESTJan 22, 20182:31 PM ESTCommentsCategoriesContact usSocialNewsletter SignupThank you for your subscription © 2018 mobilesyrup.comPrivacy.

Google’s Android boss (the head of the OS, that is – he’s not literally an android) has announced that Google is going to unleash a wearables SDK very shortly.The idea is to do exactly what Google has done with Android and smartphones, but in the wearables market, which is currently taking off and causing plenty of buzz (there was a whole heap of wearables stuff at both CES and MWC recently, particularly health and fitness gizmos).Sundar Pichai spoke about the Software Development Kit at SXSW. According to the Guardian, he said: “In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables.”“When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors... Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.”(We might add that sensors can be small and powerful – and gather a lot of information for Google, as well).Clearly, Google sees wearables as playing a big part in the future – a future in which it has its data-mining paws everywhere – but Pichai wouldn’t be drawn on rumours that the big G was developing its own smartwatch. He didn’t mention anything about hardware, and said that “from my standpoint and the team’s standpoint, we want to focus on the platform and the APIs.”Google does, of course, have Google Glass on the boil.At any rate, Pichai hopes that the release of the SDK will spark product developers to go beyond smartwatches and fitness gadgets, and start to innovate and create a whole range of smart devices.As we reported earlier today, Pichai also mentioned the Chromecast streaming dongle – which should be coming to the UK before the end of March (fingers crossed).Sign up below to get the latest from IT Pro Portal, plus exclusive special offers, direct to your inbox!ITProPortal is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

348	by Blair Hanley Frank on March 10, 2014 at 9:10 amMarch 10, 2014 at 9:10 amIt’s been a good run so far for Google’s Chromecast video streaming dongle. The $35 device, which plugs into a TV’s HDMI port and allows users to stream video from a number of different sources, captured the interest of consumers, in part because it’s incredibly cheap compared to its competitors, like Apple’s $99 set-top box.As it turns out, that pricing strategy has worked quite well for Google. Sundar Pichai, the company’s Vice President of Android, Chrome and Apps, told an audience at SXSW yesterday that sales of the Chromecast were “in the millions now, and it’s growing very actively,” according to a report by AndroidHeadlines.Google isn’t stopping anytime soon, either. Pichai says that the company plans to expand Chromecast sales to international markets. While he wasn’t clear about which markets will be getting the dongle, the Chromecast’s low price and support for popular services like Netflix and YouTube will make it an attractive choice for budget-conscious buyers wherever it expands next.The competition is going to keep heating up, though. Apple is rumored to be working on a major update to the Apple TV that would include more streaming options, and Amazon is said to be developing its own set-top box that includes gaming capabilities.Subscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headlineHave a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

349	The Google Nexus 5 has been on the market for less than six months, but rumors are already accumulating about its successor, likely to be called the Nexus 6.Some of the first news about the Nexus 6 came directly from Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai, who discussed the coming Nexus smartphone at the World Mobile Congress in February. Pichai assured that the device would not be released in the first half of the year, which has led many to believe that the Nexus 6 may launch in the last months of 2014. Sources have recently told Android Geeks that the Nexus 6 may be announced in October, which falls in step with many previous unveilings of Nexus devices. The Nexus 5, for example, launched on Oct. 31 last year and went on sale in November. The Nexus 4 launched on Oct. 29, 2012, and the Galaxy Nexus launched on Oct. 19, 2011. Even if the Nexus 6 announcement timeline is plausible, it may be some time before the public gets more concrete information on the device.There may also be plenty of time for Google to surprise the public with a new launch strategy. Notably, Google forwent an unveiling event for the Nexus 5 last year and simply announced the device and Android 4.4 KitKat operating system on its blog, as well as on the Google Play Store. Fans and pundits may expect Google to provide a similar launch for the Nexus 6, or something else completely unexpected.Still, murmurs suggest that the Nexus 6 may be developed by LG and may also take after the rumored LG G3 in design; these rumors also piggyback from old rumors that surrounded the Nexus 5 and Nexus 4 in their pre-release periods. Both the Nexus 5 and Nexus 4 were developed by LG and we both based on other LG devices --- the LG G2 was the model for the Nexus 5, while the Nexus 4 took inspiration from the LG Optimus G. Consumers saw both previous Nexus devices feature similar specs to their LG counterparts; in particular; the Nexus 5 and LG G2 both featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, a 1080p display and Optical Image Stabilization included in their cameras. Many expect that the Nexus 6 may include a number of specs to be introduced on the LG G3.The still unofficial LG G3 is rumored to feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor, a 5.3-inch or 5.4-inch 1080p True HD-IPS display, 2GB or 3GB mobile RAM, 16GB and 32GB of internal memory, a 13-megapixel to 16-megapixel camera, 3,200 or 3,300 mAh batteries, and the Android 4.4 KitKat operating system. Other rumors suggest the LG G3 may feature a 5-inch screen with Full HD or 2K resolution and a battery around 2,500 mAh. Reports predict a June release for the LG G3, after which we may be able to decipher more information about the Nexus 6.The LG G3 and Nexus 6 may not share an operating system, however, as Nexus devices notably introduce the newest Android OS to the market. It is likely two Android updates will be released by the time the Nexus 6 launches. Users should expect an update in the summer and another update, which should be launched alongside the Nexus 6. At this point, it cannot be determined whether Google will continue the Android KitKat series; however, the Mountain View, Calif., company is well known for releasing two updates each year. Reports indicate that the Nexus 6 may feature an exterior design unlike any seen on previous Nexus devices, seeing as Google usually opts for a unique design on each generation of its devices. The Nexus 5 features a matte-and-ceramic type texture, while the Nexus 4 features a double-sized glass exterior.Many are also certain that we will not learn anything about the Nexus 6 at the Google I/O conference in June. Sources have told Android Geeks that there will be no Nexus or Android announcements at Google I/O, but such new may be saved for an event later in the summer, where the Nexus 8 and Android 4.5 operating system may be unveiled. If true, Google’s 2014 timeline may mimic its release schedule from last year. In 2013, we saw Google launch new Chromebooks, developer tools and the Google Play Edition Samsung Galaxy S4 at Google I/O. In July, Google launched its Nexus 7 2013 tablet alongside the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean operating system, and introduced the Nexus 5 and Android 4.4 OS in October.As said, it may take some time for Nexus 6 rumors to solidify, but recent reports indicate that many are interested in the coming devices.Follow me on Twitter.Subscribe	Science

15 Apps For Healthy Living
(Click image for larger view and slideshow.)

Google thinks it can corner the market for wearable computing devices with the help of a new SDK it plans to offer to developers within the next two weeks. The SDK will be based on Google's Android platform, so it should include tools familiar to app writers who've already targeted Android smartphones and tablets. Google has a chance to maintain its early lead in a space that has immeasurable room for growth.
News of the SDK came from the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference, which takes place in Austin, Texas, each year. Sundar Pichai, who heads Google's Android and Chrome platforms, told an audience at SXSW Sunday that the SDK be released soon, along with Google's ""vision"" of what wearables should be.
Google first entered the wearables market with Google Glass -- connected eyewear that can take pictures and record video. Google Glass still costs an unfriendly $1,500, and Google is still being picky about who can purchase one. A less-expensive version of Google Glass is expected to hit the market late this year or early next year. Other companies, including Samsung, are working on their own connected glasses.
[A cool-looking wearable isn't enough to drive the market. See Software Is Key For Wearables In The Enterprise.]
Google is also widely expected to launch its own smartwatch by June. Very little is known about the smartwatch other than it will run Android and will be made by LG, which has manufactured the last two Nexus smartphones for Google. Android is already the world's dominant smartphone platform. If Google can convince developers to stick with Android for wearable devices, it could lead to an ecosystem that offers seamless integration for consumers and their myriad bits and pieces of hardware.




Samsung's Android-powered Galaxy Gear smartwatch



Android has taken an unlikely lead in the smartwatch space, but it's unclear how long that lead will last. Samsung used Google's Android platform in the Galaxy Gear smartwatch, which was the best-selling smartwatch of 2013. But Samsung dropped Android in favor of Tizen (its own operating system) for the second-generation Gear smartwatch.
If the Gear 2 sells in better numbers than the original Gear, then Tizen could replace Android as the world's leading smartwatch platform. The Gear 2 is a more-attractive, less-expensive device than the Galaxy Gear, and offers a better mix of features, so this is a very real possibility. Let's not forget competitors, such as Pebble, Sony, Huawei, Lenovo, and others, that are making their own smartwatches.
But connected glasses and smartwatches are hardly the only devices in the wearables space -- and that's exactly the reasoning behind Google's plan to release an SDK. It hopes developers will take the SDK and run with it, using what they already know to create new and interesting product categories. For example, Pichai, spitballing a little bit, said that Google's wearable SDK could be used to create a ""smart jacket"" rife with sensors. In other words, the sky's the limit here, and Google wants developers to reach for the stars.
The SDK should be available for download before the end of the month, which gives developers nearly three months to play with it and offer Google feedback before Google's annual I/O developer conference.

Google's Chromecast device has been selling well, if Sundar Pichai, Google's SVP of Android and Chrome is to be believed. Speaking at SXSW in Texas on Sunday the Google bigwig said that ""millions"" have been sold. Pichai also said that sales of the HDMI multimedia streaming adaptor are growing ""very actively"" and it is soon to be launched in international markets.The Chromecast was launched at just $35 in the US last July and is understandably popular at that impulse buy level price. The device allows streaming on your HDMI equipped TV/monitor of many movie and music services as well as just about anything from you can watch in Google's Chrome browser thanks to the 'cast' button. Watching on the big screen you don't need a remote as the Chromecast takes its orders from the tablet or smartphone you already own (Android and iOS, Macs and PCs with the Chrome browser).As mentioned in the intro, Sundar Pichai told attendees at SXSW in Texas on Sunday that the Chromecast was selling like hotcakes. ""We are in the millions now, and it’s growing very actively,"" he said in the first public statement about the devices sales numbers. So it is imperative that Google gets its skates on and sets up distribution worldwide. Such a launch was mentioned at SXSW but unfortunately no countries/regions were named specifically. Other competitive device makers (like Roku) have no doubt noticed the budget priced Chromecast's success in the US and would like to rub out any of Google's first mover advantage in other territories.Remember the Google Cast Software Development Kit (SDK) for app-developers was launched just a month ago and promises to make the device even more useful as more app makers can easily integrate casting into their wares. I notice that UK buyers have been able to purchase these Chromecast dongles recently, at £29.99 including delivery, but hope that Google implements an even keener price.
                    Major update activates hardware decoding by default for 4K and 8K playback. 
                
                    It becomes part of the Aimo illumination series and is built upon the acclaimed Khan Pro. 
                
                    Available from late Feb, it is again based upon Roku streaming hardware.

You either get a notification dumpster on your wrist, or you have a separate platform with apps that may or may not play nicely with the apps on your phone. In an ideal environment, the apps on your phone would compliment or enhance the apps on your wrist, allowing for reciprocal functionality that make these accessories a lot more useful.In order to do that you either need Google’s help or you need your own tools for developers to add into their existing apps. Since no one has been able to do the latter in any successful fashion yet, it was important to wait for Google to do their thing and create the tools and extend their sandbox to wearables.During the SXSWi conference in Austin, Texas last weekend that finally happened.Google’s Android and Chrome chief Sundar Pichai announced on stage that a wearables SDK would be coming in the next couple of weeks. The goal of this SDK will be to “lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working,” according to Pichai.Historically, this kind of SDK points towards a reference device of some kind in order to give developers a clear target to shoot at. We’ve known for some time that Google has been preparing a smartwatch of their own using the talented engineers they acquired when they purchased WIMM, and while it’s possible that this watch will accompany the SDK announcement it is also likely Google will work with a third party until they are ready to deploy their own smartwatch.It’s unclear whether or not Google Glass will be included in this SDK, but there’s a good chance for some crossover there. Google has the ability to put services like Google Now on your wrist, which would be an enormous differentiator between Google’s hardware and the existing wearables available today.This is the kind of thing many were expecting Google to announce at their annual developers conference, but the release of the updated Gear line from Samsung may have encouraged Google to accelerate those plans. We’ll see soon enough what Google has up their sleeves for the wearables market, and whether or not their plans will be enough to cause a shift in how useful wrist and face mounted computers really are.

361	"Main content starts below.Sign in to follow this authorALL YOUR WATCHES BELONG TO US – Google is setting out to replicate in smartwatches, fitness bracelets, etc. the success it had in smartphones – and expanding its dominion over our technological lives. Exec Sundar Pichai announced at SxSW that Google will be releasing its Android operating system for wearables. The software development kit should be available to developers in two weeks. The strategy of licensing its operating system while also selling its own hardware – Google will release a smartwatch this June – has worked well for mobile devices, where Android ships on 4 out every 5 phones and where Android tablets started outselling iPads in 2013. Here's hoping, along with famed designer and LinkedIn Influencer Don Norman, that the OS will help make ""smart"" wearables a bit less dumb. BIG (LYING) DATA – Data coming out of China are decidedly puzzling: Chinese exports plunged 18.1 percent in February year-over-year. Or at least that's what the numbers say. Analysts are pointing to the issue of over-invoicing by Chinese businesses – capital flows disguised as exports to evade China’s capital controls, as the Financial Times explains – which was already blamed for a hard-to-believe trade surplus in January. ""Chinese firms have been actually faking exports less since last spring but the practice is still creating trade distortions, by making this year’s declines this year look steeper than they actually are,"" writes Quartz's Lily Kuo. In short, no one's quite sure what the reality of China's economy is, though it does seem to be slowing. AND THEN THERE WERE TWO – In China still, the e-commerce war is intensifying as Tencent and JD.com strike an alliance against Alibaba. Tencent purchased 15 percent of online retailer JD.com, which is about to go public in the US, and will outsource its own e-commerce activities to it. Alibaba still corners nearly 50 percent of the market but now the competition has the muscles to challenge that. Tencent is the biggest Internet firm In China but has so far got most of its revenue from social media and mobile gaming, with a more modest involvement in online retail.BITCON? – After first doing so in Japan, where it is headquartered, Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in the US on Sunday. That very claim of bankruptcy is being questioned by hackers who say Mt. Gox was sitting on a lot more Bitcoins than reported. CEO Mark Karpelès' blog, Tumblr and Reddit accounts were hacked to post documents showing Mt. Gox held 951K bitcoins before the online attack that wiped the exchange's accounts clean, even though Karpelès announced 850k were stolen. So if those documents prove to be true – and several Reddit users, who can verify their own account in them, say they are – it begs the question: Where did more than 100,000 bitcoins go? Others on Reddit are pointing out that the documents are consistent with Mt. Gox's story that their internal accounting did not match the reality of their holdings. Not enough info to tell at the moment.TOP BANANA – You thought telcos were a concentrated industry? A giant of the banana trade is about to be born, through the marriage of Chiquita, #2 on the market, and Fyffes, #4. The US and Irish companies, to be reborn as ChiquitaFyffes, will together corner 29 percent of the market, passing Dole and Fresh Del Monte. These three corporations will together produce three out of every four bananas in lunch boxes around the world. And that's not even counting melons, pineapples and salads.Have you also thrown your dumb smartwatch against the wall in frustration? Are you concerned about the concentration of our food suppliers?

364	Ever since Google announced the $35 Chromecast media streaming dongle, the company has enjoyed great success. We figured sales were off the charts with early availability of the dongle being scarce throughout various retail outlets, but now we have a better idea of just how much buzz Google has been able to generate around this thing.According to Android and Chrome boss Sundar Pichai, Chromecast sales have crept into the “millions” range, though he wasn’t interested in giving us any exact figures. Either way, hitting over a million units is significant, and Google won’t want to slow down at this point.The company revealed at SXSW that they are working hard to bring the Chromecast to many more countries within the next few weeks. The device has only been available for US customers to this point, so it’ll be interesting to see just how successful this thing can be once more of the world gets their hands on it.Even crazier to think about is the fact that the Chromecast train is only just getting started. It wasn’t until recently that Google opened up the SDK to any and every developer willing and able to implement support, and we’ve seen many new apps introduce functionality as a result. It’s already blossomed into a very powerful and flexible multimedia beast, and we imagine things will get even better once more developers catch on.[via ReadWriteWeb]Google is a massive company that has eggs in many different baskets.

Perhaps the longest-tenured and most significant series in the game — the Samsung Galaxy S lineup — could be getting a shakeup of its own.After Huawei began sending out invites for an event next month, we’re now seeing leaked renders of what will likely be the P20 Lite and P20 Pro. These leaked designs reveal some interesting design choices for the upcoming devices.

365	"The wearable technology tidal wave is clearly on the horizon, and indeed Samsung announced no less than three smartwatches at Mobile World Congress (MWC) a couple of weeks ago.Of course, that particular trio runs Tizen, but Google is on the verge of firing out an SDK for the Android faithful.

That’s the news from out of the SXSW festival, which is probably best known for its music stuff, but also encompasses Film and Interactive.
Sundar Pichai, Google’s SVP of Android, Apps and Chrome, says the SDK rollout - expected in a couple of weeks - will include a “vision for developers of how we see this market working”.
Of course, we’re not just talking about smartwatches here. One of the other notable examples of wearable tech is Google Glass, the augmented reality thingy for your head.
Pichai says it’s Google's role to provide the SDK, but up to developers what they do with it.
We’re still not entirely convinced about wearable tech, with two of the major selling points seemingly being a) fitness applications, and b) the slight convenience of not having to take your phone out of your pocket.
Regardless, expect the smartwatch scene in particular to explode when the Apple iWatch touches down later this year.
In other SXSW news, Pichai says Google Chromecast is coming to ""many more countries"" in the coming weeks. Come oooooooon UK.

366	"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againAt South by Southwest, the head of the Android and Chrome teams touches on a wide variety of topics, including how Google plans to reach the next billion uses.AUSTIN, Texas -- Google plans on releasing an Android software developer kit for wearables within two weeks.That was the biggest announcement from Sundar Pichai, Google's head of Android and Chrome during an on-stage interview with John Battelle today at South by Southwest.But during the hour-long talk, Pichai also discussed a wide range of issues related to how Google imagines its two operating systems being rolled out around the world, and how people will use and implement them.Pichai's announcement of the new Android wearables SDK came as he discussed the potentially huge market for the mobile OS on devices beyond smart phones and tablets. He said a big question at Google is how the company will successfully pull off that kind of expansion. He talked about the company's hopes to be included in a number of cars in coming years, and about how powerful sensors are becoming ubiquitous, first in fitness devices, but soon in a wide variety of other technology. Google, Pichai said, wants to create APIs for those sensors, and as such, the SDK for wearables is a big first step.But Google knows that mobile phones still present a huge growth opportunity, and Pichai lauded the full range of phones -- from sub-$100 devices to high-end smart phones -- that can lead to the next billion users. Pichai touted Google's willingness to let people use Android for free, though he noted that the company requires licensing if companies want to build Android devices with Google services on top of the OS.When it comes to auto manufacturers implementing Android, Pichai noted that in today's world, many choose to stick to Apple's iOS. But he likened that approach to walking into a hotel and finding that an in-room stereo system only works with iOS devices. ""They're probably losing at least half of their users,"" he said.Battelle asked if Google has plans to put Android on technology like devices from Nest, which it recently purchased for $3.2 billion. Pichai wouldn't bite but did say that Google hopes to develop a set of common protocols that allow different devices to work together. Without being specific, he hinted that Nest could be part of that. ""We are thinking hard about the layer which will connect all these devices together,"" Pichai said. ""That's something we will work hard"" for.While Google doesn't say how many of its Chromecast systems it's sold, Pichai did say that the number is in the millions, all in the United States. And Google recently released an SDK for the Internet streaming device which 3,000 developers have already registered for.As well, Google is expecting to begin making Chromecast available internationally within weeks.Pichai also touched briefly on Google's internal Project Ara, a skunkworks of sorts for advanced projects and research.He said that the effort is aimed at concepts that are slightly futuristic, but which can be quickly commercialized. For example, he said, the Project Ara team is working on ways to create modular smart phones, devices that can be broken down into component parts so that rather than replacing a phone, they can have new parts added. ""Think about it as APIs for hardware,"" Pichai said. ""So people can build together in a modular way.""Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic.

	 Google is releasing the software specifications in a so-called kit to encourage new designs for wearable computers, like Google Glass used here on Feb. 26, 2014.      Photo Credit: Bloomberg News / Angel Navarrete     Google is releasing tools for software developers to make applications for wearable-computing devices, trying to repeat the success it's had with the Android mobile-operating system for gadgets people wear on their bodies.Google senior vice president Sundar Pichai, speaking at the South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin, Texas, said the tools will be available in the coming weeks and that the so-called software developer kit will be for more than just wristwatchlike devices. Google wants to give developers a way to make any number of applications -- even a jacket with sensors -- said Pichai, who runs Google's Android and Chrome businesses.Google is moving into new devices as it looks for ways to get users on its services and boost advertising dollars. The company based in Mountain View, Calif. has been offering early versions of a computerized eyewear called Glass.Google and Apple Inc. have both already fueled an ecosystem of applications for smartphones and tablets. Google is unveiling the new software tools so developers can also make everything from games to social networking apps for wearable devices.The market for wearable computers is projected to reach $20 billion in sales by 2016, according to IHS.Pichai also said Google has sold more than a million Chromecast devices that lets users stream video from a mobile device to a television.The device will soon be released internationally, he said.The latest LI business news in your inbox Monday through Friday.By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

Google is set to release an SDK for Android on wearable devices in the next two weeks.The release of the kit, which will allow third-party developers to produce apps for wearable devices running Google’s operating system, was announced at South by Southwest conference in Texas.Senior vice president for Android, apps, and Chrome Sundar Pichai featured in a panel discussion.He said: “In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android. That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working.”The company’s own Google Glass device already runs Android, but the development kit will open up possibilities for a wider range of wearable devices.According to Re/Code, Pichai also said: ““When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly. It’s for partners and developers to figure out.“It could be a jacket … with sensors — I don’t know.”How can innovations in IT make your business more efficient and effective?

369	"Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is all set to release a software development kit (SDK) for wearable devices in the next two weeks, according to Sundar Pichai, SVP of Android, Chrome & Apps. The SDK would be used to create a standard method for sensors to ‘talk’ to the Android operating system.“We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,” said Pichai at South by Southwest (SXSW), reported The Verge.Through SDK, developers could design apps for wearable devices like games and fitness trackers. The popular wearable devices are smart-watches, fitness bands and smart-jackets.Pichai did not reveal if the company is making a new wearable device, but according to the rumors, Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is collaborating with LG electronics for a new smart watch. LG made a smart watch which is integrated with Google Now enabling a user to give commands any time and receive feedback. Google is expected to unveil the new smartwatch at the I/O developer event, in June.Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) designed Google Glass, the first wearable gadget from the tech giant. Google Glass is fitted with an optical head-mounted display that displays information on natural language commands. Google Glass sports a 5 megapixel camera, and can record at 720 pixels.During the interview at SXSW, Pichai was asked if the company is hoping to integrate Android on devices made by Nest, a home automation company that Google acquired for $3.2 billion. Pichai not directly answered the question, but hinted that Nest could play an important role in the “mesh layer,” enabling devices to co-ordinate with each other.Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) faces a stiff competition from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the wearable segment, which is known pretty much to the market. Last year, in December, Apple operations head Jeff Williams held a meeting with FDA executives Dr. Margaret Hamburg and Dr. Jeffrey Shuren to discuss the “mobile medical applications.” The iPhone maker is said to be designing sensor technology under the supervision of Tomlinson Holman, inventor of Lucasfilm THX sound system and the first 10.2 sound systems.Holman is doing research on predicting heart attacks by studying the sounds that blood makes while flowing through arteries. Apple is also hiring health and medical experts to launch new products. Also, the company could be gearing up to unveil a smartwatch or fitness bands that can predict health stats like heart rate, calories and step counts within the next year or two.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!

An illustration picture shows a Google logo with two one Euro coins, taken in Munich January 15, 2013. — Reuters picSAN FRANCISCO, March 10 — Sundar Pichai, head of Android, has announced that software development kits for creating operating systems for everything from smartwatches to headsets are coming this month.
	Pichai made the announcement at SXSW Interactive and said that the software development kits (SDKs) will not only make it easier for companies and individuals to use Android on fitness trackers, motion sensors and other wearable tech devices, it would also simplify data collection from sensors in order to create supporting apps and functionality.
	Google has identified a need to create a common platform and language for wearable devices so that they work with each other and for the time being at least, Pichai said that this is where the company will be focusing its efforts.
	It has no plans to announce a consumer-ready wearable tech device of its own, for the moment anyway.
	In recent months, reports have emerged that Google is developing a smartwatch in collaboration with LG, and of course the company already makes one of the world’s highest-profile wearable technology devices in the form of Google Glass.

Real EstateCompany thinks of wearables as a platformiNVEZZ.com, Monday, March 10: Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), the world’s largest online search company, will release a software development kit (SDK) for Android-based wearable gadgets later this month, Sundar Pichai, the company’s senior vice president of Android, Apps and Chrome, announced at a conference on Sunday. In Friday’s trading Google shares closed down 0.4 percent at $1,214.79. The company’s stock has gained nearly 8.5 percent so far this year.‘A world of sensors’""In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android,"" Pichai said at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas. ""That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working.""Pichai also said that Google sees wearable devices as a “platform”, meaning that the online search giant is focusing on creating a standard method for sensors used in wearables to ‘talk’ to its Android operating system.He said: “We see a world of sensors... Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.”While existing wearable gadgets have been mostly limited to smartwatches and fitness gadgets, Pinchai thinks that there are many more possibilities. “I think we’re just scratching the surface,” he said, hoping that the SDK release would spur the creation of new devices. Google is working to build the layer that will connect all these devices, he added.Smartwatch rumourWhile Google’s ‘platform’ thinking is a clever way of positioning Android as a major player in the fledgling industry without committing Google to building wearables itself, the online search giant is already on its way to releasing at least one wearable product. Google Glass, the company’s spectacle-like computing device, is currently being tested by early adopters and is expected to be released sometime this year. And recently there have been rumours that Google is working with South Korea’s LG Electronics on a Google-branded smarthwatch, which may be announced at the US company’s I/O developer conference in June (Google share price: Google Smartwatch launch in June?). According to these rumours, the device will be powered by a version of the Android operating system centred on the company’s intelligent personal assistant, Google Now, and search features.As of Friday’s US close buy Google shares at $1,214.79As of Friday’s US close sell Google shares at $1,214.79Website Terms of Use By accessing and using this website, you agree to the following terms of

Google may be gearing up to unveil its very own smartwatch later this year, but when has it ever bogarted its own OS? Google executive Sundar Pichai revealed at SXSW that Google plans to release the Android SDK for wearables in two weeks.Pichai said that Google is releasing the SDK for wearables well before the devices hit the market so that it can get “plenty of feedback” first, which obviously means Google would also be able to strengthen its own smartwatch.But of course, smartwatches aren’t the only device Google thinks Android could power. Pichai mentioned that the software could one day be used to power a “smart jacket” with sensors. For some reason.Pichai is a high-level Google exec, overseeing Android, Chrome, and apps like Gmail. He also oversees hardware, like the Nexus smartphone and tablet, Chromebook, and Chromecast. Pichai mentioned at the conference that Chromecast sales are now “in the millions.”Google’s own smartwatch, which has not been confirmed by the company, is reportedly slated for release some time this year. A report from TechCrunch last month stated the watch would start shipping in mid- to late March, but a later report from CNET suggested the watch won’t make its big debut until June.The smartwatch will reportedly come with a full-color display and an LCD background, as well as “Google Now” alerts, which are personalized alerts that include meeting alerts, traffic updates, events, sports scores, stocks, dinner reservations, weather alerts, flight updates, and more.Google is said to be working with LG on the smartwatch, as it did with the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphone. The smartwatch is expected to be a paired device, requiring an Android phone.Researchers from Canalys forecasted last month that smart bands would ship 8 million units in 2014. That number is expected to triple to 23 million next year, and by 2017, Canalys estimates over 45 million smart bands will be shipped.Currently, Samsung holds the lead in the smartwatch market with a 54% market share, followed by Sony with a 19% market share, and Pebble with 16% of the market.In addition to Samsung, Sony, and Pebble, Google may also be coming up against Apple, which has looooong been rumored to be developing an iWatch that may be solar-powered and would likely come with a greater health focus. Apple is reportedly working on a feature for iOS 8 called Healthbook, which would monitor the user’s vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, hydration, and possibly even blood data points like glucose levels, in addition to the usual “calories burned” and “steps taken” features.  Image source: talkandroid.comApple's iWatch may be solar powered and health-focusedApple reportedly working on health features for iWatch and new charging techniquesTechnology trends and news by Faith Merino

Download to find out...INTERNET GIANT Google's Android SVP Sundar Pichai has revealed that the company will release a software development kit (SDK) for wearables within the fortnight.Speaking at the South By Southwest conference (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, Sundar announced the imminent arrival of ""Android for Wearables"".He told conference attendees, ""When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform.

There is talk of a collaboration with LG that might be revealed at the Google I/O developers conference, but Google hasn't announced anything yet.Pichai was keen to point out that the release of the SDK represents an opportunity to go beyond glasses and watches, describing them as ""the tip of the iceberg"".Apparently the SDK will represent a framework model for the Internet of Things, the vision of smart gadgets that are able to interconnect. The Internet of Things will be the topic of a debate at The INQUIRER that starts next week.So far Google has been playing it cool about releasing its own products, wearable or otherwise, and has even hinted at the end of the Nexus range, however its release of a wearables SDK will make it easier for third parties to produce wearables running Android. µ

374	"Google Glass helped launch the burgeoning wearable tech market, but now the search giant is branching out beyond its futuristic specs.Google senior vice president Sundar Pichai told SXSW attendees this weekend that, before the end of the month, Google will launch an Android software development kit (SDK) for devices like smartwatches.In October, there were reports that the search giant was working on its own branded smartwatch. But according to the Wall Street Journal, Google wants to provide developers with a ""vision"" for their own wearables via Android, much like it does with smartphones and tablets.According to the Journal, Google intends to release its SDK well before products actually hit the shelf, hoping to earn ""plenty of feedback"" from developers, Pichai said. Google is hosting its annual I/O developer conference from June 25-26, so it is possible we'll see some hardware then.This is just the beginning of Google's wearable plans, though. Pichai tipped a future that could include an Android-powered ""smart jacket"" with built-in sensors.The executive also commented on Chromecast  sales, which are ""in the millions."" The dongle launched initially in the U.S., but will be rolling out to additional countries soon.For more, check out all the news from SXSW and the slideshow above.AT&T's New Mobile Plans; Apple Wins Smartphone Sales; Spritz Speed ReadingReport: Mt.

375	"SXSW Google is preparing to release a new SDK for makers of wearable devices in the hope of running Android into a myriad of accessories.Top exec Sundar Pichai told the South by Southwest conference yesterday that the company is prepping the software development kit for release in the next two weeks, the Wall Street Journal and others reported.""In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android,"" Goog's senior veep of Android, Chrome and Apps said. ""That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working.""While Google already has its ""Glass"" and is also planning a smartwatch of its own, which will be made by partner LG, the Chocolate Factory also wouldn't mind if lots of other hardware companies were to stick Android in their wearables as well, considering the model has worked so well in mobiles.The Chocolate Factory's release of Android as a free-to-use OS for smartphones has helped the company gobble market share in the sector at an enormous rate and given it good working relationships with manufacturers. In turn, this has helped it create its own line of Nexus mobile devices without having to build its own factories.Mountain View is planning to unveil its own smartwatch at a Google developer event in June, as CNET reported last month. But the firm is hoping that by releasing wearable-friendly Android into the wild, developers will be able to come up with a wide range of devices, including ""smart jackets"" with embedded sensors, Pichai suggested.The executive also said that Google is thinking about using recent acquisition Nest Labs, a smart thermostat maker, to help it develop a ""mesh layer"" of software that will make all its devices work better together. ®

376	"Social media linksSecondary menuSections Google Chromecast has just hit its second birthday, and to celebrate the occasion Google is offering users of the streaming dongle a few free gifts. Up until December 31, Chromecast owners (whether new or existing) will get free film rentals on Google Play (including HD films) and a free 90-day sub to Google Play Music.While the offer is sure to appeal to those who already own a Chromecast, it's also clear that this is a bid to tempt new buyers into what's already a very tempting proposition in the first place - the Chromecast ha been quite a successful device with Google reporting over 10 million sales inside 2014.A lot of its success had to do with Google’s pricing – it cost just £30 – a very attractive price considering the gizmo’s impressive capabilities, which turn any dumb HDTV into a web-connected “smart” TV. As Chromecast snowballed, more and more publishers began to add support. And as more publishers added support, Chromecast’s popularity grew even more. The snowball effect rolled on and on and then, eventually, the dongle made its way over to the UK with BBC iPlayer support in tow. Chromecast, along with things like the Roku Streaming Stick, represent an easy and cost effective means of turning an HDTV into a web-connected smart TV. Most of the reason why they’re so popular is because TV manufacturers, like their friends in the car industry, are far too slow when it comes to rolling out technology in their products.Google highlighted quite a few Chromecast milestones in its recent earnings call. According to the Big G’s Chief Business Officer, Omid Kordenstani, there have now been over ONE BILLION casts made since Google first launched Chromecast. Usage of Chromecast has also increased by 60% since its initial release date and, if that wasn’t enough, Google also confirmed that Chromecast is now the most popular media streamer in the US. SmartTVs, while widely available, are still something of a luxury for many, with prices ranging into thousands of pounds right down to the £600 mark. Eventually, all HDTVs will be smart, web-connected units. But until this fateful day arrives, those of us not willing to part with obscene amounts of money for an idiot box, can now, at least, bridge the gap with awesome solutions like Google’s Chromecast.And there’s going to be a follow-up device too. Speaking at GigaOm's Structure Connect conference, Google VP of product management Mario Queiroz hinted that a new version is in the works, but neglected to say when the Chromecast 2 would launch –– although early 2015 seems most likely. Here’s an extract from the report: “Queiroz wouldn’t say much about what Google is planning for the second iteration of Chromecast. But he did indicate that Google is “building an ecosystem of different endpoints” in which the Chromecast is one endpoint and other “Chromecast devices” are other endpoints. “I can say we really want to bring the richness of this first screen–second screen experience to life,” said Queiroz. “The hardware capabilities will give us a better opportunity to take full advantage of a large screen paired with a small screen.”The Chromecast is a truly tiny device, weighing around 30g and looking a lot like a USB memory stick, albeit one with an HDMI connector at the end. This allows it to slot directly into the back of your TV (although there’s an extender cable inside the box if you want to place it elsewhere). It also requires a USB connection for power, and the cable can either slot into your TV’s port, should it have one (probably the tidiest option) or into the wall using the supplied AC adapter. It’s a shame the thing can’t draw its energy through the HDMI connection, as this would essentially make it a totally wireless product and cut down on the mass of cables collecting behind your TV. The Chromecast does not, however, require a wired Internet connection, as it connects to your home network and hence the web via b/g/n Wi-Fi.There’s no supplied remote control, as part of the Chromecast’s design is that you use a companion device – a smartphone, tablet or computer – for choosing content to watch and controlling playback. Sound and video works, albeit with some lag and, for the latter, stuttering. To be fair to Google, the web-casting feature is still officially in beta mode, so there’s definite room for – and an expectation of – improvement in the near future.Set-up could not be simpler. After getting the Chromecast connected to your Wi-Fi network (you do this using a smartphone or computer and follow on-screen instructions; it takes perhaps three or four minutes in total), it’s very much good to go.To watch a video, you’ll need an iPhone, iPad, Android device or a computer running Windows, Mac OS or Chrome OS. So should you want to watch a film on Netflix, you’ll need bring up the Netflix app on your phone, or open Netflix in your Chrome web browser, choose whatever it is you want and then hit the “cast” icon that should now be on the screen. You’ll be asked which device you’d like the video cast to, and once you’ve selected the film will start playing on your TV. If you have a TV with CEC-compliant HDMI ports, the Chromecast will even turn on the TV and switch it to the correct input channel. Playback can then be controlled from the device that was used to select and start the video. It’s not a perfect system – there’s a slight delay from the moment you press something and the action taking place, and there’s also the possibility of you forgetting which device you used to start off playback, what with us having so many computers, phones and tablets in our houses these days – but it works well enough and keeps the price down.To cast a web tab, you need to add an extension to Chrome. This results in a cast button appearing in the top right of the browser window. Hit this and the tab will appear on your TV.Google has also added 10 new channels to Chromecast, bulking up the $35 HDTV dongle’s arsenal of shows substantially. As of December 10, you can now stream the following channels on Google’s uber affordable HDTV dongle: VEVO, Red Bull.TV, Songza, PostTV, Viki, Revision 3 and BeyondPod.“Casting” – the art of beaming photos and videos from your phone/tablet to Chromecast – has also been made easier via the inclusion of Plex, RealPlayer Cloud and Avia. Not seeing these new features yet? Don’t worry, Google says they’ll all be live within the next few days (so by Dec 13th, latest). Video playback supports up to 1080p quality, although this depends on the source material and the speed of your broadband: older YouTube videos at 240p will look pretty ropey and soft, while new Netflix material like Orange Is The New Black is gloriously sharp and clean.If your broadband speed isn’t up to much, the Chromecast will use adaptive streaming to avoid buffering, and this can also result in softer, non-HD images (we never experienced this, but in theory it could happen).5.1 Surround Sound is supported by Chromecast but without a dedicated audio output you’ll need a TV with a digital audio output of some kind to experience it.Google teamed up with the BBC for the launch of Chromecast in the UK, confirming full support for the TV Corporation’s popular iPlayer application. As well as iPlayer, Chromecast features a raft of other services – all the Google ones, of course – as well as things like Real Player Cloud, a service that allows you to store videos in the cloud and then Cast them, via an app on your phone/tablet to a Chromecast-connected HDTV.Other notable new additions include: AllCast, Plex, Avia Media Management and, if you fancy a bit of old school gaming, Tic Tac Toe. The Chromecast SDK is now open to developers, meaning there’ll be plenty more applications and content on the way very soon. Bizarrely, both Channel 4 and ITV have said they have no immediate plans to support the service. For shame!Reports are emerging that the VLC app will soon be updated with full Chromecast support across Android, Windows, iOS and OS X.“The popular VLC media player will be upgraded to version 3.0 soon,” reports 9to5Google, “introducing a whole host of features to the software, including support for Google’s Chromecast streaming device. The change was mentioned in a VLC change log on the VideoLan website.”VLC's near-universal codec support means users with the updated app will be able to stream near any media file from pretty much any device using the above OSes to a connected Chromecast TV.We still don't know the exact launch date, but media fans should expect something to appear in the not-too-distant future.VideoStream is a simple web-app that lets you stream any type of video, regardless of codec, straight from your PC to your Chromecast-connected HDTV. Once downloaded, the VideoStream extension is installed within Chrome, which means you don’t have to bother with additional software – this is all that’s required. VideoStream supports local video files stored on your PC and your home network, so you can leverage content from things like a connected NAS drive. There’s also a remote control app available via Google Play for free, so you don’t even need to open your PC once the app is running. The Chromecast is, for the money, an incredibly tempting deal for anyone with Netflix, or a love for YouTube, and the inability to watch these on their TV. It’s easy to setup, even easier to use and we’ve found it reliable in our couple of weeks of using it. Web casting is a little spottier, but hopefully this will improve as it moves out of beta. If, however, you already own a smart TV, an Apple TV or one of many devices that already allow YouTube, Netflix and other video streaming, it’s hard to see the appeal of this little dongle. It’s likely to find its place in the home of late adopters rather than those who are well equipped with the most recent of tech products.ContactDennis Publishing Editorial Offices

                        Michael Moore joined TechWeek Europe in January 2014 as a trainee before graduating to Reporter later that year. He covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to mobile devices, wearable tech, the Internet of Things, and financial technology.                    Software development kit which lets Android developers create apps and services for devices such as Google Glass will be released in two weeksGoogle has announced that it is releasing a software development kit (SDK) to allow developers to create apps running its Android operating system for wearable technology devices.At the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, the company’s senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps, Sundar Pichai, told an audience that an SDK will be available in a fortnight’s time.“In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android,” Pichai said. “That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working.”There has been growing speculation that Google is planning to launch a smartwatch as it looks to enter what has become a fast-growing market, with the release of an SDK a major indication that such a device may arrive soon.Several manufacturers that currently use Android in their smartphones have also announced plans to release wearable technology devices in the near future. This includes HTC, which demonstrated several wearable products in secret at the recent Mobile World Congress, and has pinpointed the sector as vital to restoring the company’s flagging fortunes.Motorola, which was recently sold by Google to Chinese manufacturer Lenovo, has also said it plans to have a collection of wearable technology products on sale by the end of the year.“It’s our intention to deliver some interesting wearable products this year,” said Motorola’s senior vice president Rick Osterloh, although he said that the devices were still very much in the development stage and was unable to provide any details on release dates or price.One issue that the announcement may raise is the fear that technology such as Google Glass may be used for nefarious or illegal purposes. Pichai looked to address these fears recently at Mobile World Congress, stating in an interview that he believed it was the open nature of the Android software which made it safe to use.“Android was built to be very, very secure,” he said. “I would argue that it’s the best way for a platform to be secure, because every researcher in the world can inspect it, every developer in the world can inspect it, and I think that contributes a lot to Android security”.The company’s Glass technology, which offers users a head-up display view of various apps and services, has garnered major press interest during its trial phase, but has attracted controversy regarding the reaction from some law enforcement agencies and members of the public. The company recently released a set of recommendations for Glass users, which describe how one should behave while wearing the device following feedback from beta testers, warning them not to be ‘glassholes’.Suits you?

379	"‘Android for wearables’ to be released this month, confirms software boss in SXSW appearance
Stuart Dredge

Sun 9 Mar 2014 19.24 GMT


Last modified on Tue 21 Feb 2017 18.52 GMT

Google is preparing to launch a software development kit for wearable devices later this month, as it encourages hardware firms to use Android in their smart watches, fitness trackers and other gadgets.The plans were announced by the company’s senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps, Sundar Pichai, at the SXSW conference in Austin.“In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables,” said Pichai, after outlining Google’s vision of the wearable technology market.“When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors... Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.”He added that while smart watches and fitness gadgets are the two most obvious wearable categories, Google hopes that releasing its SDK will stimulate the development of a host of new devices. “I think we’re just scratching the surface,” he said.However, Pichai – who added Android to his responsibilities in 2013 when its founder Andy Rubin moved on to other projects within Google – gave no hint about the company’s plans to make its own hardware. “From my standpoint and the team’s standpoint, we want to focus on the platform and the APIs.”At SXSW, Pichai was interviewed on-stage by entrepreneur and investor John Battelle, who pressed him for details of Google’s Android licensing program – particularly reports of hidden clauses that require partners to set specific Google services as the default (search for example) if they want access to its core applications.“Android is one of the most open systems I’ve ever seen. What makes Android great is it’s literally designed from the ground up to be customised in a very powerful way,” said Pichai, who pushed back on the idea that Google is too controlling.“We do have business relationships, we do do licensing relationships and people want to use Google services on top of Android. But in theory you can use Android without Google. If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it’s not exclusive – you can preload any other services you want.”He was later pressed on the issue by an audience member, who noted that manufacturers setting certain non-Google apps as default on their Android devices would be barred from using its crown jewels.“None of what we do is ever exclusive. Yes, we may require some services… but you are fully free as an OEM or carrier or partner to place other services on the phone,” he said, before declining to go into more details. “I can’t comment on specific things… these are business deals that you do on a partner-by-partner basis.”The interview focused on various aspects of Google’s business, including the company’s recent $3.2bn acquisition of thermostat maker Nest, and how it fits into Google’s software strategy. Battelle wondered whether Nest’s products will integrate Chrome or Android, before jabbing “Will we have to join Google+ to turn off our thermostat?”“Definitely not the second one!” said Pichai, who added that Google is focusing on an ecosystem spanning these devices and more. “We need a mesh layer, and a data layer in which this all comes together,” he said “We are thinking hard about the layer which will connect all these devices together.”Pichai was asked about messaging app WhatsApp, which is being bought by Facebook for up to $19bn, but which is rumoured to have either fielded an alternative offer from Google, or agreed to notify the company if it was in acquisition talks with other big tech firms.“We met with them recently. We were definitely interested in seeing them. They are one of the most successful companies on Android… But we did not make an offer to acquire them,” said Pichai, who said Google merely told WhatsApp that it was one of the major players within the Android ecosystem, offering unspecified “help” if required.And the acquisition? “To me it’s evidence that the platform is working at scale,” he said. “This signifies that the smartphone platform is fundamentally changing how we communicate.”The interview also touched on Chrome OS versus Android, with Pichai maintaining that Google has no immediate plans to merge the two. “We view them as building blocks. By investing in both, we believe that over time we will be able to meet almost all use cases,” he said. “We feel fortunate to have both.”He declined to give a specific sales figure for Google’s Chromecast USB dongle for TVs, but said Google is excited by its performance so far. “We are in the millions now, and it’s growing very actively,” he said, while promising Chromecast will go on sale in “many more countries” in a few weeks’ time.In the wide-ranging conversation, Pichai denied that Google is planning to buy up sports rights for YouTube transmission – “That’s a lot of money!” – while declining an invitation to finally announce YouTube’s long-rumoured music subscription service, which is thought to be on the verge of launching.Pichai answered by asking the audience how many of them listen to music through YouTube already, provoking a healthy show of hands. “It shows there’s an opportunity there. For us, the amount of music consumed through YouTube is very, very interesting,” he said.“To us, we see the synergies in how people play music and consume music in YouTube can be brought together in an interesting way. I think we can enhance the music experience for users.”Pichai also expressed excitement about the potential of two new projects within Google: modular smartphone Project Ara – “you can think about it as an API for hardware” – and the sensor-based world-visualising Project Tango. “Things like Tango are definitely going to happen in the future. Your phone will be perfectly capable of it,” he said.He defended Google against an accusation that it doesn’t fight hard enough on behalf of its Android partners against “Microsoft patent blackmail” – in the words of Battelle, referring to a succession of licensing deals Microsoft has struck to be paid by Android manufacturers for use of its IP.“We do our best. It’s a tough problem,” said Pichai, describing the licensing payments as “a cost of doing business today” for Android partners, and suggesting that Google is lobbying the US Congress hard over patent reform rather than seeking a court battle with Microsoft on behalf of its manufacturers. “We do a lot of work behind the scenes,” he said.Pichai also addressed rumours that he’d been in the running to be the next CEO of Microsoft, at least until the company appointed from within in the shape of Satya Nadella. Pichai suggested that Microsoft has big challenges going forward.“I think they have some interesting decisions to make. If you’re running the company, a company that’s been built around Windows – the success of Windows – now faces a multi-platform world,” he said.But would he have been tempted if he had been offered the role of Microsoft CEO, as several media reports predicted he would be? Pichai deflected the question with a joke. “I think they got confused with two people with Indian sounding names!”"	Science
380	The Google Chromecast UK release date could happen within the coming weeks, according to Google. Speaking during the SXSW conference this week, Android Chief Sundar Pichai said the Chromecast would be released in “many more countries” before the end of the month. Google originally released the Chromecast HDMI streaming dongle in July 2013 alongside the Google Nexus 7 2 announcement. The device was then opened up to developers with a special SDK in February this year, to expand the device’s app compatibility. Pichai added that customers have already purchased “millions” of Chromecast, but failed to outline specific sales figures. Earlier rumours also suggested that the device would launch outside the US in March, but these were originally dismissed by Google. However, it seems those rumours were spot on after all. Google Chromecast FeaturesThe Chromecast is an HDMI media streaming dongle that plugs directly into any HDTV. It allows you to stream services like Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies and Google All Access Music from your smartphones and tablets to your TV over Wi-Fi.It runs on a simplified version of Chrome OS and pulls content from the cloud rather than your smart device, meaning multiple users can interact with the content at any one time. Google has made sure the Chromecast is compatible with Full 1080p HD streaming and 5.1 surround sound so you don’t lose out on any quality when streaming. Not only is it fully compatible with Android devices, but tehre’s also an iOS app in the App Store to attempt to ape the AirPlay offerings.Read more: Best TVs 2013 Via: TheNextWeb	Science
381	"When a company is creating a wearable device, it has a lot of options for operating system and implementation. Everything has to be made from the ground up, and it’s a lot of work for smaller companies. Plus, companies don’t even use Android many times. The new Samsung Gear 2 devices use Tizen instead of Android, making the wearable market more fragmented. But Google has it covered, as the company is releasing a developer SDK for wearables in just two weeks. This SDK will help standardize the way wearable devices will send and receive data. Not only will this make creating a smartwatch easier for other companies, but it will encourage them to use Android as its main operating system. However, this goes beyond just smartwatches. This applies to pretty much any wearable device, which Google envisions will work on one system. This could very well be Google preparing for its own wearables. Google Glass could adopt these standards (or the standards will be based on what Google Glass uses), and this could be a sign that the rumored LG Google smartwatch will be released soon. Seeing it released alongside the SDK would be perfect, though it’s doubtful that Google would release a new device without an event. Do you think Android is the right operating system for wearable devices, or is Google stretching Android across too many devices? Leave a comment! Source: The VergeWhat I’d like to know is will Samsung continue to add apps and update the Galaxy Gear that runs Android.Exciting news.Would be really cool if Google leveraged Google Now alerts right out of the gate…http://www.bestsmartwatchescompared.com/video-reviews/googles-nexus-gem-smart-watch-can-apple-compete/They might take the lead from Apple – and keep it – if they did!Select the amount of total data you need for the entire plan.For example, if you need 2 lines with 1 GB of data each, you would select 2 GB of data with the data slider below.

382	Above: Google's Android Chief Sundar PichaiGoogle wants to make it easier for lots of wearables to run on the Android operating system.In about two weeks, the tech giant will release an Android software-development kit (SDK) for wearable devices. This comes from Sundar Pichai, Google’s senior vice president of Android, Chrome, and apps, today at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.“We’ll lay out a vision for developers as to how we’ll see this market working,” Pichai said, according to a report from The Verge.Sure, Google has turned out the Glass wearable device, but lots of other companies, like OnBeep or Vuzix, have been working on wearables, too. They might be running different operating systems. So developers writing apps on those operating systems are essentially working in isolation, not inside a common ecosystem.Wearables will be a big topic of discussion at our upcoming VentureBeat Mobile Summit on April 14 to April 15 at Cavallo Point Resort in Sausalito, Calif. It’s an invite-only gathering of 180 top mobile executives. A common SDK could lighten the burden on wearable makers to do everything on their own.“We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,” Pichai said in The Verge report.At the same time, the move could turn Google into the enabler of a wearable platform, just as it’s made Android a common platform for mobile phones and tablets, alongside Apple. Perhaps Apple will want to cook up a wearable SDK of its own soon, to keep Google from running away with wearable market.	Science

Pinchai didn’t reveal which countries the stick will be launching in, or the price, he did indicate it would be launching within weeks.The dongle which plugs straight into any HDTV’s HDMI socket and offers wireless streaming from apps and browsers, is said to be heading to the UK this month, so it may well be that a launch worldwide will happen at the same time.The Chromecast costs $35 in the US, and it would be expected to be at a slightly higher price point elsewhere as with most hardware . It should still come in cheaper than the equally desirable but costlier Roku Streaming Stick, which is available to pre-order at $50.Related News:

Speaking at this year’s SXSW conference, Google (GOOG)’s SVP of Android, Chrome & Apps Sundar Pichai said the search giant will release an Android-based software development kit [SDK] that will make it easier for companies to create wearable devices that run on Google’ OS.By focusing on wearables at a platform level, Google is clearly aiming at making its technology accessible to a wide variety of wearable devices.“When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,” Pichai said. “It’s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket … with sensors — I don’t know”, reported Re/code.The SDK will be available in two weeks, added Pichai, without hinting at whether Google will be building its own smart watch, as many expect.The news comes ahead of Google’s I/O developer’s conference in June, where the Mountain View, Calif.-based company is expected to unveil its own smart watch developed in collaboration with LG electronics. According to Forbes’ Amit Chowdhry, “the LG smart-watch is believed to have always-on access to Google Now so that you can speak commands any time and receive feedback right away.”Google’s latest push into wearable technology comes as Samsung, the largest maker of Android smartphones and the world’s top smartphone maker, switched to a new OS for its latest wearable devices. Samsung’s Gear 2 smartwatches run on Tizen’s open-sourced OS, a rival mobile software platform created by a consortium led by the Korean electronics manufacturer, Intel (INTC) and a group of telecom operators.Your email address will not be published.CommentName *Email *Website

It's taken far too long for the Google Chromecast UK release but there are signs that it is finally heading this way.At SXSW this week, Google's head of Android Sundar Pichai, revealed that the streaming stick will be coming to ""many more countries"" by the end of March.
Given that rumours were rife that the device was set to launch in March - rumours that were eventually denied by Google - it is pretty much nailed on that one of the countries Chromecast will be coming to in a matter of weeks will be the UK.Because of the wait, it was launched in July in the US, a number of Chromecast rivals have already hit homes in the UK.First there was Now TV, a cheap little streaming box made by Sky, and more recently the Roku Streaming Stick.Both of these offer similar things that the Chromecast does, so Google will be hoping that its direct links with Google Play movies and TV shows and Google Play Music All Access will give it something of a one-up on its rivals.When it comes to Google Chromecast price, it is likely that it will come to the UK slap bang in the middle of Now TV and the Roku and be available for around £35.Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

393	"For a mid-range smartphone series, Google's Nexus lineup sure elicits a lot of speculation and anticipation. The Nexus 5 arrived to blow our minds just last year, but now rumors are already swirling around the next Nexus: the Nexus 6.A new report from Germany hints that LG will once again be tapped as the manufacturer behind Google's Nexus smartphone. LG made last year's Nexus 5 and the Nexus 4, too. So far, every time LG has made a Nexus smartphone for Google, it has been a huge hit with customers. The Nexus 5 famously sold out of the Google Play Store shortly after it was launched.It looks like Google wants to repeat that success and will pass over other manufacturers yet again, preferring to stick with LG, if this latest report is to be believed. After all, don't fix what isn't broken, right?At this point, we still know next to nothing about the Nexus 6, but there are a lot of rumors out there, which hint that the Nexus 6 will be a pretty awesome device - again.In terms of form factor, the Nexus 6 is expected to be thinner and lighter with almost no bezels at all, giving it the much-sought after edge-to-edge display. Rumors regarding the display's size and resolution have been all over the place. Some reports even claim that the Nexus 6 will feature a Quad HD, 2K display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. The size of the display will supposedly be 5.2-inches.However, given the fact that the Nexus smartphones are typically priced lower than the flagship devices made by other companies, a 2K display seems unlikely. Samsung didn't even put one on the Galaxy S5, so why should LG and Google do so with the Nexus 6? Of course, with Google, anything is possible, but it seems a little far-fetched.As far as hardware and software go, rumors point to a 64-bit processor and a 16-megapixel back camera. The Nexus 6 will undoubtedly run the newest version of Android when it launches and that's all we know, or think we know.The Nexus 6 release date is also shrouded in mystery. Google's Sundar Pichai stated that it won't arrive in the first half of 2014 and some reports hint that it might not even arrive by October. Needless to say, no one has any clue about when the Nexus 6 will be announced. Chances are we won't know too much about the device until right before it launches. Google loves to surprise us, so expect the Nexus 6 to be a real doozy.Sign up for our email newsletter today.Tech Times' biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.By clicking on 'Submit' button above, you confirm that you accept Tech Times Terms & ConditionsSpaceSecurityEarth/EnvironmentVideo GamesApps/Software

394	"Google has confirmed it will release a software development kit (SDK) for wearable devices. The search giant’s head of Android, Sundar Pichai, revealed the news overnight during a Q&A at SxSW.The SDK, which will be available to use within two weeks, is aimed at developers who want to create apps for the growing number of smartwatches and fitness bands that use Google’s Android software.At the moment, apps for these devices are largely limited to the native add–ons that are built-in by manufacturers. But with the wearables space about to boom, it appears Google is desperate to capitalise, especially ahead of the release of Apple’s iWatch later this year. Interestingly, Pichai didn’t just talk up smartwatches. He says this new SDK will be aimed at any kind of kit that can pick up data when on your body. That means anything from Android jewellery to Google Glass–style specs could potentially use the software.Pichai did not commit to any timescale for the release of any Google wearables. Google Glass is edging closer to commercial availability, with a Nexus smartwatch also rumoured.Source:EngadgetJoin our email list to get the inside line on the latest phones and money-saving offers.

398	"Sign up for our daily newsletterSectionsSecondary menu Google will launch a new version of Android designed to work on wearable devices within the next fortnight.""In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android [wearables],"" Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android, Apps and Chrome said at the SXSW conference in Texas. ""That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working.""That vision goes beyond smartwatches, which have been the dominant form of wearable technology over the past year, and one in which Google has lost ground. Samsung recently dumped Android for the more lightweight Tizen OS on the Galaxy Gear 2, but Google hopes the new version of Android will be used in a much wider range of devices.The company has, of course, already released beta versions of the Google Glass headset, which runs on Android. It has also reportedly commissioned LG to build a Nexus-branded smartwatch, which may be announced alongside the release of the SDK later this month.Google bought smartwatch maker WIMM Labs last year, which released a device running on Android 2.1.However, it's likely that Google also has its eye on the lucrative fitness tracker market, with devices such as the Fitbit Flex bands, Jawbone UP and Nike FuelBand now well established in the market.Smart clothing is another potential outlet for an embedded version of Android. ""When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,"" Pichai said, according to a report on Re/code. ""It’s for partners and developers to figure out.

 The company's existing wearable device, Google Glass, is already available to some developers on a preview basis, although Google has not yet released a full set of programmer tools for the augmented-reality glasses.  Google is also working on bringing Android apps to connected cars, using a device similar to Google’s Chromecast, (which allows users ro relay content from their phones to their TVs). This could allow users to bounce information from their Android smartphone onto their dashboard display, according to Pichai.  He added that millions of Chromecasts have been sold in the US. The product is due to launch internationally, with localised content for various markets, in the coming weeks.

403	The internet giant will release new protocols this month for conencting wearable sensors to its popular mobile operating systemGoogle has announced new plans to promote Android wearable technology, hoping to position the operating system as the default platform for smart devices in the same way that it already is for smartphones.“We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,” said Google’s senior vice president of Android and Chrome Sundar Pichai at the SXSW conference in Texas, reported The Verge.The internet gant will release a new software development kit (SDK) for wearable sensors this month, allowing this technology to more easily communicate with the Android operating system.Although Android already has a presence in the wearables market through a number of smartwatches that operate on the OS (and, of course, through Google Glass) Picai stressed that the company’s vision extends to more exotic devices, which might include smart clothing.Pichai also hinted that this new “mesh layer” of communications between Android and various sensors might incorporate the home automation devices built by Nest, the company that Google acquired in January this year for $3.2bn (£2bn).Nest has so far only produced two products – a smart thermostat and a fire alarm – but has been praised for the quality of its design and for intuitive software that ‘learns’ users’ habits.Pichai said that he sees a parallel between the smartphone ecosystem and the wearables ecosystem. While smartphones became tiny computers, wearables will become hubs for information about the real world fed by various sensors.However, in some ways smartphones are already usurping this territory. Just last month two products were launched that took the brains inside a normal smartphone and used them to power new sensors.One gadget, the Wello, is a smartphone case that uses built-in sensors to take health readings such as blood pressure and heart rate, while the other – an experimental project by Google no less – puts a Kinect sensor into a smartphone in order to map 3D space in real time.  The Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Google releases new tools for next generation Android wearables
MANILA, Philippines – With the tech community shifting its focus towards wearable computers, Google wants to make sure Android remains the OS of choice in the wearable space. At the start of SXSW Interactive Android Chief Sundar Pichai announced a new wearable software development kit (SDK) for Android, available in two weeks. Along with the release of the new SDK Google also promises to unveil its “vision” of what the wearable technology market will shape up to be.   While Pichai didn’t go into much detail he pointed out that the SDK will allow developers to harvest data from a variety of body-mounted sensors. ""Sensors can be smart and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users.”While the market is currently dominated by fitness bands and watches Pichai says that with the new SDK, Google hopes developers will think about other devices. “I think we’re just scratching the surface,” he said. Previous reports point to a Google smartwatch supposedly arriving at Google I/O later this year, but Pichai says it will take a while before Google announces wearables of its own. ""From my standpoint and the team’s standpoint, we want to focus on the platform and the APIs.""Google’s announcement comes after the Mobile World Congress where Samsung announced a range of wearable computers but ditched Android in favor of open-source operating system Tizen. – Rappler.com

405	Google’s senior vice president Sundar Pichai revealed at SXSW that the popular Chromecast dongle will soon be available in international markets. The exec said the device will launch in “many more countries” in a few weeks, The Next Web reports, without specifying the first new markets that will get the device, or actual release dates for them. International prices for the affordable media streaming gadget aren’t available at this time either.This isn’t the first time Google confirms Chromecast launch plans for international markets, but the company has never offered estimates or exact launch dates for its international expansion. Previous reports said that U.K. and Australia will be among the first countries to get the Chromecast.Furthermore, The Next Web says that Pichai also revealed Google sold “millions” of Chromecast units in the U.S., without specifying a number. Following its earnings report for the last quarter of 2013, Google identified the Chromecast as one of its biggest sellers last year, when it comes to hardware, but the company did not brag with the number of units sold in 2013.In preparation for its international Chromecast rollout, Google has already released its Chromecast SDK to developers, in order to have more Chromecast-ready apps.

Sundar Pichai, Google's SVP of Android and Chrome, confirmed that an Android SDK developed specifically for wearables and smartwatches would be arriving in the coming weeks.Making the announcement at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, Pichai said the SKD will make it much easier for companies to make Android-powered wearables, although he declined to mention whether Google was working on any wearable devices itself. Instead, he said the company was approaching wearables on a ""platform level"", meaning a focus on hooking the sensors normally found in smartwatches, such as altimeters, accelerometers and heart rate sensors, directly into the operating system at a basic level.Google hopes that by standardising how those sensors transmit their data to Android, it will become the go-to operating system for other manufacturers. In its current form, Android isn't particularly well suited to wearables - so much so that Samsung opted to move from Android to a Tizen operating system for its second generation Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo smartwatches.According to Pichai, ""when we say we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly"" than just smartwatches. Quite what the company has in mind is unclear, but if rumours of an LG-manufactured, Google-branded smartwatch turn out to be true, we could likely see smartwatches being the first of many different kinds of wearable technology in the near future.View the discussion thread.Currys launches big brand sale The best gaming monitors you can buy in 2018The best budget headphones to buy from £15Best Alexa skills: Make the most of your Echo in 2018The best PC gaming headsets to buy from £16The best gaming keyboards to buyThe best gaming mice of 2018Valentine's Day Gift Guide 2018DJI Osmo Mobile 2 smartphone gimbal revealed at CES 2018Razer aims for high-end PC audio with the Nommo ProAOC G2590PX: 144Hz gaming on a budgetPhilips 328P6AUBREB: A colour-accurate HDR monitorChord Poly: The ultimate wireless sound?Anki Overdrive reviewDJI Phantom 3 Professional reviewHoneywell Evohome reviewBest Alexa skills: Make the most of your Echo in 2018MyLifi is a lamp that beams data to your laptop via LEDsAmazon adds new Dash Buttons: What are they?Chord Poly: The ultimate wireless sound?Curious on how to set up screen mirroring on a TV?Best Wi-Fi extenders: Better coverage, faster downloads© Dennis, a trading name of Dennis Publishing Ltd, registered in England & Wales no. 1138891.

409	As 2014 progresses, it is becoming clearer that wearables are here to stay and might very well turn out to be the next big thing.With no clear OS reigning the wearables arena right now, it is an open race and Google doesn’t want Android to be left behind. Google’s SVP for Android, Apps and Chrome Sundar Pichai has announced that Google will be releasing an Android SDK specifically meant for wearables in the next two weeks. This SDK will allow developers to create apps for wearable devices running Android. Pichai notes that the SDK won’t be limited to smartwatch apps and it will be upto developers and manufacturers to use it in the way they want and figure out new form factors.“When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,” Pichai said during a talk at SXSW in Austin, Texas. “It’s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket … with sensors — I don’t know.”Samsung’s jump to Tizen in its latest crop of wearable devices has made it clear that Google will have to work hard to make manufacturers choose Android over any other platform for use in their wearable devices. The upcoming release of SDK for wearables is a right step in that direction. If there are apps for wearables on Android, manufacturers will be more likely to choose it as the platform in their wearables. Nobody wants the pain to start a platform and build an ecosystem from scratch.The release of SDK at this time also makes sense for Google if the company is indeed going to launch a smartwatch around Google I/O 2014, as it will give developers some time to build their apps.Pichai also reiterated at SXSW that Chromecast will soon be heading to international markets but did not specify an exact date.

	Google is readying a version of its Android OS tailored for wearable devices. Google’s Sundar Pichai told the SXSW conference Sunday that it would be releasing an SDK for makers of wearable devices such as smartwatches in two weeks’ time.The SDK will be aimed at other makers of smartwatches and wearables, even though Google itself is thought to be working on building wearable hardware — with a Mountain View smartwatch project rumoured for months. (Last year Google confirmed it previously bought a smartwatch maker called WIMM Labs).The release of Google’s smartwatch has been slated for either mid to late March, or pushed out to June (although the company has not confirmed its plans).As with its mobile strategy, the spread of Android is Google’s primary concern here — with the wearable SDK allowing the services it offers packaged with Android to reach even further, via other makers’ hardware.According to the WSJ, which reported the SDK announcement earlier, Pichai said Google is releasing its Android software developer kit for wearable devices well before actual devices hit the market so the company gets “plenty of feedback” first.It’s possible Google is hoping to garner feedback for continued development of its own smartwatch device, as part of the SDK initiative.It’s not just smartwatches Google has its eye on here either. The WSJ reports Pichai saying the company hopes its Android platform helps developers create many types of wearable devices — with Pichai apparently throwing out a sensor-laden, Android-powered “smart jacket” scenario as one possibility. The newspaper also notes Pichai was asked about Google’s recent acquisition of smart thermostat maker Nest Labs — and said Mountain View is thinking about creating a “mesh layer” of software to make its various devices work better together.Latest headlines delivered to you daily"	Science
412	"During the course of his recent address at the South by Southwest (SXSW) event, Google's Android/Chrome SVP Sundar Pichai said that the company has efforts underway to release an Android-based Software Development Kit 
(SDK) for wearable devices.Pichai said that the SDK is scheduled for release towards the end of March. Despite the fact that the launch of the SDK is essentially aimed at smartwatch and other wearable devices, it still remains to be seen as to how well the Android operating system can adapt to small-screen devices.According to the information shared by Pichai, the forthcoming launch of the SDK underscores Google's attempts to give the developers a vision of how the company sees the wearable-devices market working in the future, shaping the prospects of smartwatches, Glass, and other wearable devices.Nonetheless, giving a rather generic description of the SDK, Pichai said that it will chiefly help developers to take a couple of sensor data and merge them with something more usable. With the description implying that the SDK will likely cover a wide array of sensors, applications, and devices, it is apparent that Google is not limiting its vision to smart glasses and smartwatches alone.Moreover, with Google's popular Android operating system already moving into the automobiles arena, Pichai said that he endeavors to connect to a horde of sensors and wearables with Android.Famed microbiologist Dr. Mark Wainberg, who played...Microsoft Corp. has claimed that it has already...Struggling to fight back soaring heroin and HIV...During the most recent Nintendo Direct, the mobile...Fresh Express is recalling a limited number of...Tech giant Google Inc. has plans to introduce a...TopNews runs with your support.

413	Google’s SVP of Android, Apps and Chrome Sundar Pichai has been speaking at SXSW Interactive, and the headline news from his on-stage slot is the arrival of a new Android Software Development Kit (SDK) for wearable devices. That means Android app developers can start writing programs to be used in fitness trackers, smart wristbands and other wearable devices.It’s no secret that Google wants Android to be running on just about every device possible. In Google Glass the company already has a wearable headset of its own running Android, and the mobile OS will spread to a whole new set of hardware with the launch of the SDK.“When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform,” said Pichai, as reported by the Guardian. “We see a world of sensors… sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.”“In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables,” Pichai went on to say. “I think we’re just scratching the surface.” No specific products or gadgets were mentioned, but the Googler did confirm that the focus was on wearable technology incorporating various different body sensors — imagine a Google Now alert when your heart is beating a little too fast, perhaps.There were plenty of other interesting nuggets of information in Pichai’s interview and Q&A session at SXSW. The SVP confirmed that Chromecast was selling well and would expand to more countries in the near future; he also hinted that Google’s heavily rumored YouTube-based music service is still on the cards.“For us, the amount of music consumed through YouTube is very, very interesting,” said Pichai, though he stopped short of confirming that a new service was in the pipeline. “To us, we see the synergies in how people play music and consume music in YouTube can be brought together in an interesting way. I think we can enhance the music experience for users.”[Image courtesy of Cory M. Grenier / Flickr]	Science

Google wants to mimic Android’s success on smartphones and tablets in the emerging wearables market. To this end it is launching a set of developer tools which make it easier for manufactures to run the OS on wearable devices. While talking at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference over the weekend, Sundar Pichai, Google’s SVP of Android and Chrome, said that Google will release a developer SDK designed to make it easier for OEMs to create wearable devices that use Android. Google hopes the new SDK will enabled developers to create many types of wearable devices.A key component to the new SDK is a new layer which will create a standard way for Android to collect data from sensors. One of the attractions of wearables is that lots of different types of data can be collected often via sensors that aren’t traditionally found on smartphones or tablets. By creating a standardized way for the sensors to send their data to Android it means that the OS becomes sensor agnostic while providing a uniform way for that data to be read.  “We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,” said Pichai, “they need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together.” Google hopes the new SDK will enabled developers to create many types of wearable devices.This move comes at a critical time for Android with regards to wearables. At MWC 2014 Samsung unveiled its latest wearable devices, the Gear 2 and the Gear Fit, both of which run Tizen, an alternative open source Linux based mobile operating system, rather than Android. By standardizing sensor collection OEMs can now opt for Android instead of alternative OSes.By wearables Google means more than just smartwatches and fitness bands. “When we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly,” said Sundar.  Google hopes the new SDK will enabled developers to create many types of wearable devices. Sundar even suggested a future with “smart jackets” that are loaded with sensors and powered by Android.Google will release the new SDK in about two weeks time and is looking for “plenty of feedback” from developers. During the conference Sundar Pichai didn’t say anything about any wearables which Google itself may release but instead emphasized that Google sees Android being used for wearables “at a platform level.” Of course the release of an SDK could be the prelude to one or more Google designed wearables including the often rumored Google Smartwatch.

 SVP of Android, Chrome & Apps Sundar Pichai revealed that the company is going to release a software development kit (SDK) for wearable devices in the next two weeks to create a standard method for sensors to ""talk"" to the Android operating system. Google is focusing on wearables at a platform level. This means that Google's goal is to make its technology accessible to a wide variety of wearable devices.""We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,"" said Pichai at SXSW, reported The Verge. The SDK will be used by developers to build apps for wearable devices such as games and fitness trackers. Wearable devices may include smart-watches, smart-glasses, fitness bands and smart-jackets.Pichai did not hint at whether Google was building a new wearable device, but there are rumors of a collaboration with

 on a new smart-watch. The LG smart-watch is believed to have always-on access to Google Now so that you can speak commands any time and receive feedback right away. The new smartwatch is expected to be announced at the Google I/O developer event in June.Google's most well-known wearable device is Google Glass. Google Glass has an optical head-mounted display that shows information based on natural language commands. Google Glass also has a 5-megapixel camera and can record video at 720p.
Google competes with 
 
Apple
 under a number of a categories and the wearables market will likely not be an exception. This past December, Apple operations head Jeff Williams met with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) executives Dr. Margaret Hamburg and Dr. Jeffrey Shuren to discuss ""mobile medical applications."" Apple is rumored to be working on sensor technology that could predict heart attacks, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The Apple team working on the technology is led by Tomlinson Holman, who is known for inventing the Lucasfilm THX sound system and the first 10.2 sound system. Holman is studying ways to predict heart attacks by studying the sounds that blood makes as it flows through arteries. Recently, Apple has been hiring health and medical experts as it prepares to release new products. Apple may release smart-watches or fitness bands that have sophisticated health statistics like heart rate, calories and step counts within the next year or two.During the interview at SXSW with John Battelle, Pichai was asked if Google is planning to put Android on devices made by Nest, which is a home automation company that Google acquired for $3.2 billion. Nest is known for designing and manufacturing thermostats and smoke detectors that are sensor-driven and self-learning. Pichai did not answer the question, but hinted that Nest could be a part of a ""mesh layer"" that Google is building, which would enable devices to work together.Google Android is the most popular smartphone platform in the world with a 61.9% market share, according to Gartner. A version of Google Android is used on Google Glass and Google TV. The Google Chromecast also uses code from the Android operating system. Pichai said that over one million Chromecasts have been sold so far and it will be released internationally soon. Google Chromecast is used for mirroring mobile devices to TVs and streaming movies and TV shows. By providing an SDK for wearables, Android's market share will continue to skyrocket."	Science
416	Google Inc. announced that it is planning to release tools that will provide software developers with the opportunity to make wearable-computing devices software. The company is said to be trying to bring back the success it had when releasing the Android mobile-operating system for smartphones and by this dominate a new generation of wearable technology. This step will enable Google to draw the attention of developers and make users more familiar with the “ecosystem” powered by its Android operating platform. According to analysts, Google Inc. has headed towards new devices and is seeking different ways to attract more users for its services and increase their advertising income.  Sundar Pichai, who is the Senior Vice President of the company and is responsible for Android, revealed at the South by Southwest Interactive Conference that the tools in question are expected to be available on the market in the weeks that are yet to come. The new toolkit was also said by Mr. Pichai to be appropriate for developers who create smart watches, fitness trackers and even “smart jackets” operating under Android. As reported by the Financial Times, Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai said that this step will take care of Google’s vision for wearable devices “at a platform level”. He also said: “When we say wearables we are thinking about it much more broadly.” Mr. Pichai explained that the company bets on its Android software platform to assist developers in creating many different wearable devices. He denied the rumour that Google’s software would be used in smart jacket with sensors. After the acquisition of Wimm Labs in 2013, Google Inc. has been working on a new wearable device, which is expected to be revealed soon. The company was reported to be investing a lot of efforts and money into a new smart watch, which is considered to be manufactured by LG Electronics. Google Inc. fell by 0.40% on Friday to close the session at $1 214.79 per share, marking a one-year change of +45.90% and a market capitalization of $408.23 billion. According to CNN Money, the 42 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Google Inc. have a median target of $1,319.50, with a high estimate of $1,500.00 and a low estimate of $1,050.00.

417	Google is ready to release a version of Android aimed specifically at wearable devices, it has announced.Speaking at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Texas over the weekend, Google’s Sunday Pichai announced that the company is all set to launch a software development kit (SDK) for manufacturers of smartwatches and other wearable devices.Naturally, Google will be making its own smartwatch, which is said to be a partnership with South Korean manufacturer LG. But as with its Nexus range of smartphones and tablets, this device will be a kind of reference design for other smartwatch manufacturers to riff off.Pichai did note, however, that the smartwatch was only one example of wearable devices that could make use of the forthcoming SDK. Of course, Google already makes a different kind of wearable smart device in the shape of Google Glass, but Pichai mentioned his vision of a jacket containing multiple sensors as another possibility.As with the stock Android SDK, this smartwatch SDK will be made free to manufacturers. It should launch in two weeks time.Many smartwatch efforts up to this point, including the ill-received Samsung Galaxy Gear, have used heavily modified versions of the regular Android OS, which hasn’t been optimised for smaller form factors.It may be one reason Samsung turned to its own Tizen OS for its recent smartwatch follow-up, the Samsung Gear 2, which was announced towards the end of last month.Read More: 5 reasons why smartwatches are still a dumb ideaVia: WSJ	Science
418	"It’s quite rare for Google to comment on sales, but now we’re getting some idea how the Chromecast dongle fared commercially. This info comes from Google SVP Sundar Pichai himself who said at SxSW that the number of streaming dongles sold reached millions.
Of course, there is no way we can verify that claim since exact sales figures are never made public. Even Pichai’s “millions” is still on the vague side. We can only infer this success based on the reception and popularity that Google’s streaming device has enjoyed ever since it launched in the market.When the Chromecast was released in July, the device immediately sold out within just a day. Again, we will probably never know how many devices were in stock in the first place. We can only presume it was quite substantial, even after the number of times it went back in supply. That was despite the lack of sources of content back then.Chromecast also became a trendsetter. It ushered in a new generation of portable devices that delivered streaming content, video or otherwise, to TVs not in boxes but in small, USB thumdrive-sized dongles. There was very little setup involved or space needed. Just plug it in to an HDMI port, as well as a USB port for power, and you’re good to go.The good news is that even if Pichai was only half right, the Chromecast success story is far from done. Google has recently made available its Cast SDK for Android app developers to take advantage of. And probably more importantly, also at SxSW, Pichai reiterated Google’s commitment to make Chromecast officially available in more markets really soon. When that will take place, however, is still anyone’s guess for now.VIA: GigaOM

He added that the goal is to take Android beyond smartphones and tablets, reports CNET. Google can be described as a pioneer in the field of wearables thanks to the Google Glass push. However, Google Glass was (and still is) more of a tech demo than an actual product. Google has yet to introduce truly affordable wearables with mass market appeal. In fact, nobody has.Google is expected to roll out a smart watch later this year and there is talk of a cheaper Google Glass design, but we are still talking about vapourware at this point.

420	"Best flagship smartphones of 2017Aadhaar Virtual ID could be useless without critical updatesWhen it comes to the next level of technological innovation, there's no denying that it is going to be in the wearables segment. From Google Glass to the rumoured Apple iWatch to fitness trackers, wearables are the future. Now Google is getting serious about making sure that at least at the platform level, it has strong control on new and upcoming wearables. According to The Verge, Google's SVP of Android and Chrome Sundar Pichai has said that in two weeks the company will launch a developer SDK (software development kit) aimed at wearables. Pichai made the statement at the ongoing South by South West festival in Texas (SXSW). The SDK will make it it easier for companies to create wearable devices that run on Android. Pichai didn't give any hints about new wearables that Google was working on said that he is looking at wearables from ""a platform level."" Essentially Google is trying to make sure that new hardware makers turn to the Android OS when creating wearables, thus giving Google the edge in the segment without actually creating new hardware. Recently Samsung launched its Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo smartwatches and has chosen to run them on the Tizen OS. Tizen, which Samsung has supported in terms of development, is said to be Samsung's backup plan. The move is seen as step taken by Samsung to reduce it's dependence on Android, which runs on nearly 80 percent of the smartphones in the world and on nearly 63 percent tablets, according to the latest numbers. For Google, winning the OS war will be crucial in the wearable device race. But whether all manufacturers see the appeal of Android for wearables is still questionable. Some, like Samsung, could try and develop their own platform, so as of now the future for Android-based wearables is still fuzzy.Published Date: Mar 10, 2014 14:40 PM

421	Google has sold millions of its popular Chromecast video streaming dongle in the U.S. and hopes to expand to other international markets soon.Google's Chromecast streaming device received favorable reviews from its users and critics and its impressive sales results, announced recently, reflect its success. Sundar Pichai, Google's SVP of Android and Chrome, said at the SXSW (South by Southwest) conference in Austin, Texas, Sunday, that the Chromecast sales are ranging in millions in the U.S. where the device is currently available, reports GigaOm.The exclusivity to U.S. is going to end soon as Pichai revealed that the Chromecast multimedia streaming dongle will soon be available in various other international markets. Pichai did not specify which markets the dongle will be available in, but it is likely that the United Kingdom will be a strong contender in this category. Possible expansion to some markets in Asia and Europe will only add to the growing success of Chromecast.The company's announcement on the Chromecast sales is vague without any exact numbers, but it is the first public comment on Chromecast sales. The dongle consistently took the best-selling consumer electronic title on Amazon.com for months, challenging Amazon's popular Kindle. Some users even ordered the device from across the borders and despite the lack of some streaming services like Netflix in certain areas, Chromecast was well-accepted.Google launched the HDMI Chromecast dongle at an event in San Francisco, last July. The video streaming dongle grabbed a lot of attention for its impressive features at a low price of $35. Users can stream videos directly from Netflix, Hulu, Google Play, among other popular services. It also supports mirroring of Chrome Browser and streams music as well. Access to different websites and services from a tablet and casting it on a TV was highlighted after Google imposed new guidelines to ban porn from its dongle, last month.Google has time and again released updates to improve overall Chromecast experience. Most recently, Google unlocked its Chromecast SDK (software development kit), letting all app developers to push their apps or website content to the video streaming dongle. Last December, the web giant added support to stream content on Chromecast through Google Play music and movies directly from the web, eliminating the total dependency on a smartphone.Since Google did not reveal the sales figures, comparison with competing rivals is difficult. According to GigaOm, Roku's earlier announcement revealed it had sold almost 8 million units in the U.S. till date. Apple also revealed that Apple TV generated as much as $1 billion in 2013 including media sales.	Science
422	It might not be the Google smartwatch revelation that some might have been waiting for, but it might be the next best thing. Google SVP Sundar Pichai announced at SxSW that the company will be making available in two weeks a sofware development kit (SDK) based on Android that manufacturers and developers can use for their next hit smart something.The description of the SDK is pretty generic and pretty vague. All Pichai says about it at this point is that it will help developers to take a couple of sensor data and combine them into something more usable. If that sounds like it could cover a wide range of sensors, applications, and devices, it is precisely because Google isn’t limiting its vision to smart glasses and smartwatches alone.The wearable device market is still in its infancy and there is still a lot of room for innovation. We have seen some of those at work, like contact lenses that assist diabetics monitor their sugar levels, shirts that help athletes keep track of their heart rates, or even clothing and accessories that alert parents to their baby’s needs. None of these are devices you strap to your wrist or put on your head.Google will be leaving it up to other parties to think of the use cases the SDK will be applied to. There is, however, still some lingering questions whether Google will be eating its own SDK dogfood for its rummored smartwatch or if it will use a slightly different software based on Google Now, as some rumors put it.VIA: Re/code	Science
423	"Google is releasing an Android-based developer SDK aimed at the wearable segment by the end of this month.After smartphones, wearables are clearly the biggest point of interest for major tech companies. The new segment is gaining tremendous significance with more companies joining the bandwagon. Google, world's largest internet company and the most dominating mobile OS maker, is not going down without a fight in the rapidly-growing wearable segment. Speaking at the SXSW (South by Southwest) conference  Sunday, Google's SVP of Android and Chrome, Sundar Pichai said that Google will be releasing a new developer SDK (software development kit) based on its popular Android platform to help companies create a wide range of wearable devices.This will not only boost the emerging wearable segment, but help Google be a leader in yet another category. According to The Verge, Pichai said the new Android-based SDK will be ready in two weeks but he was sketchy about the details.  Pichai said the SDK will serve as a platform for the sensors in the wearables to carry messages to the Android to function. With this, Google is looking at the bigger picture.""When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,"" Pichai said, according to Re/Code. ""It's for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket ... with sensors - I don't know."" The wearable segment is still in its infancy, but is witnessing technological innovations by the day. This new category goes beyond smartwatches, health tracking bands and eyewear.  Google is reportedly developing a new smart contact lens that will help wearers keep a tab on sugar levels. A shirt that helps track heart rates for athletes, clothes and accessories for babies to alert parents about their needs and more are on the anvil.  Google's role in these devices can be huge by giving a platform that companies and developers can use to create all kinds of wearable gadgets.Pichai did not give any hints if Google will also be developing its own line of products based on the new SDK anytime soon, like its most recently rumored smartwatch. One thing for sure is that consumers will be treated with a variety of Android-based wearables in the near future."	Science
424	"Google's Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas has revealed that the company will release a software development kit (SDK) in the coming two weeks that will allow developers to build Android software for wearable devices.CNET quoted Pichai as saying, ""In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android. That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working.""Pichai also noted that the company aims to take the Android platform beyond smartphones and tablets.In January, some leaked code was spotted that pointed to the development of an Android Fitness API to harness wearable devices. It was said that Google has been reportedly working on an API to allow developers to harness the potential of smartphone hardware.The Android Fitness API was being speculated to enable the storage of data via multiple sources to the user's Google account. The apps could further show charts and other information from the data derived. It is, of course, not yet known whether the new API would arrive with the next Android release, or as a Google Play Service.There have been earlier reports about Google working on a smartwatch of its own, a wearable device that could be revealed within the first half of this year.Google's rumoured smartwatch is said to be manufactured by LG, which has been its OEM partner for Nexus smartphones (Nexus 4 and Nexus 5) for two consecutive years.Contradicting the wearable device trend an earlier report suggested that despite the hoopla, wearable gadgets like wristwatches for checking text messages or eyeglasses that can capture video are unlikely to make a splash with consumers anytime soon, given the clumsy designs, high prices and technological constraints of many of the current offerings.For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.Ketan Pratap covers daily news and rumours at Gadgets 360.

An unnamed Google executive based in Dublin, Ireland has leaked some insider information on a major reshuffle related to Nexus series. As per reports coming in, Google is all set to retire Nexus 7 tablets and launch Nexus 8 with Intel microprocessor in the month of July, 2014.Nexus 7 has sold just 3 million units, disappointing Google as the user behavior is slowly shifting from 7 inch to 8 inch tablets. With the possible release of Nexus 8, it will be directly in competition with Apple iPad mini, Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0, Galaxy Pro Tab 8.4 and LG G Pad 8.3. Reportedly, Nexus 8 would be loaded with Android 4.5 (or Android 5.0, whatever Google chooses to name it).Another report claims that Nexus 8 would ditch Snapdragon processors from Qualcomm and choose Intel instead.In case Intel is chosen, then it is being speculated that Moorefield chip with top speed of 2.33 GHz can be a possibility which can also give a boost to the tablet’s graphic department with its PowerVR G6430 graphic engine.Android 4.3 was named Jellybean, 4.4 was named KitKat; hence the next version of Android which is 4.5 can be named with a letter L. And some forecasters have predicted that the name can be Lollipop or Lemon Meringue Pie considering that Google always name new versions of Android based on desserts.Previously Google had named updates such as Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb and Ice Cream Sandwich.The new 8 inch tablet can be launched during Google I/O, a developer’s conference which will start from June 25th in San Francisco.In case Nexus 8 is launched, it will be supported by launch of Nexus 10-2 as well, which will also support Android 4.5 version.The next version of Android – either 4.5 or 5.0 will have enhanced battery life, speed and a new Android RunTime or ART as default among other updates.Google engineers have been focusing more on the ART environment, which can ensure faster application performance due to ahead of time compilation and better battery life as the demand for CPU is lessened.These are still speculations as of now, as another theory states that Google can ditch selling tablets all together and focus entirely on Google Play Edition variants of third-party devices, which can give better revenues with less investments. This is sure that Google has some long term plans related with tablets, and the year will end with lots of action in this regard.Do you think that Google should really retire Nexus 7 and focus solely on 8 and 10 inches tablets?

426	Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is all set to release a software development kit for wearable devices towards the end of this month to enable the hardware firms to use Android in their smart watches, fitness trackers and other gadgets. Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps announced this at the SXSW conference in Austin.“In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables,” said Pichai, after outlining Google’s vision of the wearable technology market.He said that wearable’s always need a platform. Sensors are small and powerful, and could collect a lot of information that can be useful for users. He added that the company is building the right APIs for this world of sensors. Pichai said that the smart watches and fitness gadget are the two most popular devices, in the wearable category. Keeping this in consideration, Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is expecting that SDK would enhance the development of a range of new devices.Pichai kept silence on the Hardware subject, and gave no indication about the company making its own hardware. He said that from his point of view, as well as team’s standpoint, it would be better to focus on the platform and API.When asked about the Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Chromecast devices, Pichai deferred from giving the exact sales number of the USB dongle for TVs, but added that Google is upbeat by the performance so far. Pichai said that the sales has reached in millions and increasing ahead. Pichai, also, said that Chromecast would be available in other countries, as well, in the coming weeks.He said that the company has a business relationship, licensing relationship and users like to use Google services, in addition to the Android. However, it is not possible to use Android without Google.Pichai took the responsibility of Android in 2013 after founder Andy Rubin moved to other projects inside the Google. Pichai, in his interview, said that Android is one of the most open systems, and it is designed from the ground to become a very powerful customizable platform. The senior executive denied that Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is too controlling.	Science
427	"Monday, February 12, 2018 | Updated at  2:37 PM ETBrace yourselves everyone, here comes the new Google Nexus 7, and other new Google devices. Some reports suggest that they could come as early as April, or a June/July release of this year.Don't go dumping your Nexus device just yet, there are a lot things to consider such as the news about the new Google products being just educated guesses and rumors, but at the same time, a lot of the technology bloggers, and even the mainstream newspapers are all taking notice.According to the Highlight Press, the market of size 7 tablets have become a deluge for Google. It wants to expand into an 8. Yes that's right, a Nexus 8. But the Nexus 8 will not be alone. Google intends to debut their long awaited Nexus 10 2; as well as debut the new Nexus 6, goodbye Nexus 5.And there is even talk about the Android 4.5 or Android 5 operating system, with Lollipop and Key Lime Pie respectively. Whatever the last two are, Google's new devices sound delicious.The Nexus 8 is expected to rival the iPad Mini, the NASDAQ an online technology and business site reported. Sources in Taiwan are said to expect initial shipments of two million units. The International Business Times reported that both ASUS and Google are looking to replace their Snapdragon computer chips, the ones that run the iPad, and have them run on the strongest Intel computer chip, Moorefield.This is enough tech-talk to make Tony Stark's Iron Man jealous. But wait -- there's more: not only has it been reported that Google intends to debut new devices, there is talk that they will discontinue the Nexus line, the Times reported. By discontinuing the Nexus line, Google wants to focus on their Google Play Edition.The Nexus has three specific purposes, the Time reports. Firstly, it provides developers, Android and Google, with devices that they can show off Android at its best on. Secondly, Google can sell unlocked full-price devices directly to users. Thirdly, it provides mainstream users with the best of ""pure Google"" experience at the lowest cost possible.The seed of Google speculation may have started when The Inquirer reported that Taiwanese phone maker HTC had been chosen, by Google, to build its next-gen tablet. This was reported on since Feb. 6, exactly one month ago.HTC stated it has orders to make a high-end model of Google's tablet line, that they could be shipping in the third quarter of 2014, The Inquirer reported.Google's proposed launch of their new Nexus products comes at a time when the Nexus sales have been low, and the market is saturated with similar looking tablets.2014 for Google could be a good year.Tagstech, nexus, Google, google nexus 7 who can enter to us sanctuary city A Department of Health and Human Services study found 22,798 unaccompanied children were housed with parents, aunts, uncles, or other close relatives between September 2015 and February 2016, nearly equaling the total of the previous 12-month period. 4:44 hassan jameel Get ready for the final matchup of the big tournament.CategoriesCategoriesFollow Us"	Science

Google has finally said that it is soon planning to launch Chromecast, its cheap media streaming dongle outside of the US.Google's Senior Vice President of Android, Chrome and Google Apps, Sundar Pinchai, said at SXSW that the company would be bringing Chromecast to ""many more countries"".
Pinchai did not reveal which countries would be in line to get the dongle or the pricing the rest of the world will be facing, he did indicate that it would be launching elsewhere within a few weeks.While we've looked on in envy since Chromecast was launched in the US last year, this is our third indication that Google Chromecast will be coming to Australia in the last few weeks.Reports emerged mid-February that Telstra has been in talks with Google in how it could bring Chromecast to Australia, and just last week the ABC indicated that it was readying itself for Chromecast as well.But while Pinchai's comments have us believing that Chromecast has an Aussie future, we're still waiting on confirmation that Australia is on the list for a launch.Via: The Next WebGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

429	"Google helped put wearables on the map with Google Glass and now it’s aiming to solidify its position in that market. In around two weeks’ time, the tech giant will be releasing an Android-based software development kit (SDK) that will specifically target wearable devices.
The promise came from Google SVP Sundar Pichai speaking at SxSW in Texas. According to Pichai, the wearable SDK will help developers tie up different sensors that can be found in wearable devices, easing how the developers will get access to sensor data and mash them up together. Aside from that, the SDK remains shrouded in mystery.Pichai, however, did not comment on rumors of a Google smartwatch. And while the upcoming SDK might be taken by some as sure signs of the device, the SDK isn’t meant to be tied particularly to a smartwatch. The exec says that when Google says wearables, the company thinks of a broader range of possible applications.The hottest types of wearable devices of late include smart glasses and smartwatches, but there is definitely room for more. Pichai makes mention of a jacket with sensors and we have indeed seen variants of that theme, from smart trench coats to shirts with heart rate monitors. We’ve also seen concepts for smart jewelry, glucose sensing contact lenses, and even baby onesies. The bottom line is that Google is leaving the doors open for partners and developers to run wild.It isn’t clear yet what exact form the SDK will take, though it will be based on Android. This is similar to the Glass Development Kit (GDK), which is still available only to a relative few. A Google spokeswoman later commented that the company won’t be holding a big event to mark the release of the SDK, so we’ll be keeping an eye out for the announcement.VIA: Re/code

Be part of the largest Android communityorAlready registered? Log in hereWe reported earlier that the Nexus 8 is set to drop is July of this year, after the Google I/O event which is scheduled to happen on June 25th. This seems to be correct instead of earlier reports around the web that the device may drop in late April of this year. The push back however seems to coincide with rumours that the device will be using Intel chips instead of the tried and tested Snapdragon ones from Qualcomm to power the iPad mini rival.The Intel chip in question is called the Moorefield chip which is said to hum away at a top speed of around 2.33 GHz. If the Moorefield chip is used with the Nexus 8, it will also be very able when it comes to GPU muscle thanks to the PowerVR G6430 graphic engine.Other reports seemed to indicate that the actual chip will be ready for bulk shipments soon. This may very well be as soon as Q3 of 2014 which is very much in line with the reported release date of the Nexus 8 tablet from Google and Asus. Word on the street is that Google may unveil the actual tablet during the Google I/O event as well as the next big upgrade to the Android software, which many are already dubbing lollipop. The tablet may then become available during the weeks following the event.Apart from the speculation on what chip the Nexus 8 is likely to have and what the name of the Android version that will come with the phone is going to be there really isn’t a whole lot more on the actual Nexus 8 device yet as far as specifications go. If Moorefield comes with the device though, we can probably expect some pretty impressive specs to come along with the affordable hardware that Google is known for delivering?What do you think about the possibility of Google dumping the Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm for Intel’s Moorefield? Please leave your comments below and we will get back to you.
Well, it looks like Google is planning to move a step ahead in the race to the crown. Having an intel chip means higher performance, graphics....!! I am getting a good feeling about nexus devices now.

432	Some exciting news has come out of the SXSW( South by SouthWest event) this morning. It look as though Google may be looking to launch an open SDK for the Android wearable platform. The announcement came up this morning by Google’s Sundar Pichai who is the Vice President of Android, Apps , and Google Chrome, who says that the SDK will be ready to go and will get an official Google launch in just two weeks from today. The official statement from Pichai was: -In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android, that will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working.-Now that we know the SDK is coming, we have to wonder what sort of other confirmations we’ll get from Pichai or anyone else at Google regarding the matter. We have already heard rumors that Google will be working LG on the Google Smartwatch, perhaps in the weeks to follow either company will confirm that this is actually the case. Even if it is true, LG may not be the only one to release a smartwatch working off of the Android Wearable OS this year. Since it will be an open SDK fairly shortly, that means that other OEMs will have the chance to work with the software packages to complete a wearable product and release it to the public. Wouldn’t it be nice to see an official Google Smartwatch in partnership with LG, and then multiple other wearable products from OEMs like HTC, Motorola, and others as well? Whatever the case, we might at least get to see the rumored Smartwatch that both Google and LG are working on together at this years I/O event in San Francisco. There’s only a few short months to go before many of us will be touching down at Google I/O 2014, and excitement is certainly rising to see what Google may have to offer and compete with other OEMs in the wearables space.We’re sure to see some cool things inside the official Google Smartwatch, but arguably what might be more intriguing is the fact that Google is making this SDK open and releasing it to the public for use with OEMs and Third Party Developers. One thing is for sure, it really is going to be an exciting year for the wearables industry.Get your app reviewd by our editorial staffWrite articles for AndroidHeadlinesLet us know your insider tipCopyright © 2018 Android Headlines.

But as with the Nexus line of smartphones that Google makes, the company wants to help lay out a “vision” for developers for wearable devices.In making it easier for developers to use Android on wearable devices, Google would appear to be following a playbook similar to the one it used in mobile devices, where it makes Android available for free to phone and tablet makers. The software kit might give Google an opportunity to attract developers and grab a quick lead in a new category.

434	Google hasn’t exactly revealed sales figures of the Chromecast, but it did say soon after the launch of this HDMI dongle that they had underestimated its demand. This $35 dongle became an instant hit soon after it was launched last year, and even though its only available in the U.S. right now, there has been speculation that it is ready to go global. At SXSW today, Google’s Android chief Sundar Pichai told attendees that Chromecast sales are now in the “millions,” and that they are continuing to grow very actively.Pichai also said that in the coming weeks Chromecast is going to be released in more countries, however he didn’t detail exactly which countries will be the first after the U.S. to receive this popular dongle. Previous rumors suggest that the UK might be the first international stop for Chromecast, a UK retailer had its availability listed for March 1st but that was later clarified to be provisional.It remains to be seen how soon Google is able to launch Chromecast officially in other countries, pricing would obviously vary by region and country. The $35 dongle does a bang up job of streaming content to a TV, and now that its SDK has been opened up, developers have been creating some very interesting applications for it.Filed in Gadgets.

The wearables market is likely to continue to explode as more device makers look for ways to grow outside of the smartphone world. That's why it makes sense for Google to provide an SDK for Android wearables, as doing so will make Android a more attractive choice for manufacturers interested in crafting new wearable hardware.

436	"At SXSW 2014, Sundar Pichai, Google's head of Android and Chrome, revealed a big announcement: Android-powered (non-Google Glass) wearable tech is in our future. A developer SDK for smart watches, smart glasses, and maybe even smart contact lenses that run on Android will launch in about two weeks.This means that even more of your favorite Google services — Gmail, Calendar, Hangouts, etc. — will be accessible at any time, somewhere on your body. A developer software development kit, or SDK, allows any capable engineer to quickly implement Android software for hardware. Google will then be able to receive data provided by the sensors in that hardware and standardize Android across devices like Galaxy Gear and the Qualcomm Toq. Get ready for even more wearable computing via Google!
Photo: Nicole NguyenWearable tech wasn't the only thing on the Google exec's mind. Sundar had a lot of things to say about Google's most buzz-worthy moves.Google recently acquired Nest, the smart smoke detector and smart thermostat company, for a whopping $3.2 billion. The acquisition made many Nest fans nervous. Would Google force all Nest users to sign up for Google+? Moderator John Battelle prompted the VP with this question, to which Sundar answered:""We are thinking about the devices made by our ecosystem partners. We need a mesh layer for this data. Google is thinking hard about the layer that connects these devices together.""Takeaway? It wasn't exactly an admission that Nest and Google+ will somehow be integrated in the future, but it does hint at some sort of connectivity to the user's Google account.The messaging service was bought by Facebook for an astounding $19 billion. Sundar was asked how Google feels about the acquisition, since the company owns very similar products (Google Hangouts, chatting via email, etc.).""This space is evolving very rapidly. What makes WhatsApp possible is the smartphone evolution. To me, the [success of WhatsApp] is evidence that the Android platform is working on scale. Services like WhatsApp and Dropbox have the same access to our API. Staying open is the guiding principle under which we operate.""Stay tuned for more South by Southwest Interactive news from Austin, TX!Cover photo source: Google

437	Google wants to help developers create wearable devices running Android. At a SXSW conference on Sunday, Google’s SVP of Android and Chrome Sundar Pichai said the search giant has plans to detail a developer SDK in a few weeks that will make it simple for wearables to “talk” to other Android devices. Pichai explained that Google’s focus is “at the platform level,” which would allow for a wearable’s sensors to communicate with the Android OS. It’s unclear if Google is working on its own wearable device (outside of Google Glass), such as a smartwatch or even activity tracker. Last we heard, LG was appointed by the search giant to create a Google smartwatch.Google’s vision for the wearable market is figuring out how a device’s sensors can convey data to Android, and how that data can then be interpreted. Via The Verge, Pichai talked about the parallel between the evolution of the smartphone ecosystem and the wearables ecosystem, saying wearables are becoming “nexuses of an array of sensors.” Instead of a manufacturers opting to create its own custom OS, Google wants to “lay out a vision for developers as to how [we] see this market working.”With Google committed to helping developers bring more Android wearables to market, it would stand to reason we’ll see a few new smartwatches this year. What kind of functionality they’ll have is another matter, but hopefully Google’s upcoming developer SDK will shed light on what to expect. According to our report from last month, LG’s smartwatch is expected to have always-on access to Google Now, which essentially means you’ll be able to speak commands at any time and easily get information. That already sounds more appealing than simply being fed notifications. Now it’s just a matter of how the thing looks.Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

438	Posted on March 9, 2014 in MobileGoogle’s head of Chrome and Android, Sundar Pichai, announced today that the company would release a new software developer kit for wearable gadgets within the next two weeks. Speaking with John Battelle at a panel discussion at SXSW 2014, Pichai mentioned that new SDK was coming from Google to help developers create Android apps for devices like smartwatches and fitness bands. “In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android. That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working,” Pichai said.Pichai didn’t give more details of what the Android SDK for wearables would specifically entail, but it will likely help developers take advantage of current and emerging sensor technology that will be baked into smartwatches and fitness bands. Google has released similar SDKs for Android for television, automobiles and tablets. Tags: Android, app development, smartwatches, Sundar Pichai, SXSW 2014, SXSW14Apple’s decision to deprecate the Unique Device ID (UDID) for iOS devices has sent the mobile advertising and analytics industry into panic mode.

442	Reuters Staff8 Min Read* Lawyer leading probe investigated Lehman collapse * Two outside law firms in probe have conducted work for GM * Two of GM’s former top attorneys worked for law firm * House Energy and Commerce Committee to investigate recall By Ben Klayman, Paul Lienert and Nick Brown DETROIT, March 10 (Reuters) - General Motors hired two law firms with ties to the automaker to look into its recall of cars blamed for 13 deaths, and a Congressional committee said it would also investigate the company’s response to a defect that first came to light a decade ago. The internal probe will be led by Jenner & Block Chairman Anton “Tony” Valukas, who investigated Lehman Brothers after the financial services firm collapsed in 2008, and alleged then that Lehman used accounting gimmicks and had been insolvent for weeks before it filed for bankruptcy. GM has worked with Jenner & Block since 2002, and at least two of the automaker’s former top attorneys, Robert Osborne and Elmer Johnson, were partners at the Chicago law firm. GM said lawyers from King & Spalding, which represented GM during some of its bankruptcy proceedings and other litigation work since, will also work on the recall review ordered up by GM CEO Mary Barra. Co-leading the recall investigation with Valukas is GM’s current general counsel, Michael Millikin. “CONFLICT OF INTEREST” Some legal experts said there could be a conflict of interest for law firms with working ties to GM to be involved in the investigation. “To me, there’s a conflict of interest,” said Monroe Freedman, a legal ethics expert and law professor at Hofstra University School of Law. “A reasonable person might question whether the firm wants to curry favor with GM, so it can maintain a good relationship or obtain future work.” GM spokesman Selim Bingol said there is no conflict of interest, and Valukas “has been charged to go where the facts take him and give the company an unvarnished report on what happened. He is the ideal person to do that, given his understanding of our business and his reputation for adhering to the highest standards.” Jenner and King may indeed speed things along, said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law. “It makes sense as a matter of efficiency since the firms know the client,” he told Reuters. In a letter to employees last week, Barra promised an “unvarnished” look at the recall that is occurring 10 years after the issue first came to light. She has not granted any interviews on the matter. GM is recalling cars to correct a condition that could allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle is traveling at high speed. More than 1.6 million older vehicles are affected. The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the “run” position, turning off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring. The House Energy and Commerce Committee said it is investigating GM and the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) response to consumer complaints related to the problems with ignition switches. ()  The committee, led by Michigan Republican Fred Upton, will hold hearings in the coming weeks. Upton led the 2000 investigation into Firestone tire failures on Ford Motor Co vehicles - resulting in the TREAD Act that requires automakers to report complaints of defects to the NHTSA. “Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner? If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended,” Upton said in a statement from the committee late Monday. In an email, GM spokesman Greg Martin said the company was “fully cooperating with NHTSA and will do so with the Committee, too.” GM may be focused on controlling the flow of information from the review. “If they want to send a message to shareholders that they have uncovered everything, they might hire an independent firm,” Richard Painter, a professor at University of Minnesota Law School, told Reuters. “But they may want to disclose just enough to keep shareholders informed, and keep other things private to keep legal defenses available to them.” Sources previously said GM’s team of investigators had begun interviewing employees involved in the problems surrounding the ignition switch, which first came to the company’s attention in 2004. GM went through a U.S. government-led bankruptcy in 2009, which is the dividing line between what became known as “old GM” and “new GM.” Valukas served as lead counsel for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s four-year investigation of “old” GM’s pension accounting, which concluded with no allegations of fraud or intentional misconduct. Jenner & Block was the lead outside counsel for GM’s initial public offering in 2010 when it returned to the market as a public company following its bankruptcy restructuring, and it has said in filings that it has worked for GM since 2002. In addition, some partners at the firm have relationships with GM that go back even farther. A Jenner & Block spokesperson on Monday declined to comment on how much the firm bills GM annually, and on whether there was any concern within the firm of a real or perceived conflict of interest in Valukas leading GM’s internal investigation of the ignition-switch recall. King & Spalding referred questions to GM. Valukas declined to comment on his appointment by GM, which said late Monday that Jenner & Block is “doing other work for us.” The No. 1 U.S. automaker has said the recall will begin next month when it has the replacement parts. Most of the affected vehicles are in North America. While recalls are not unusual, the number of fatalities involved and the way GM handled this one stretching over the past decade has the potential to cost the company hundreds of  millions of dollars in fines and possible legal damages, in addition to tarnishing its reputation. U.S. safety regulators have also opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough. The NHTSA sent the automaker a list of 107 questions about the recall to answer by April 3. In addition to ordering up an apology and crafting the letter to employees with Bingol’s help, Barra has designated assignments for top executives related to the recall, according to a person familiar with the situation. Barra placed global product development chief Mark Reuss in charge of working with supplier Delphi Automotive to obtain the replacement parts as quickly as possible and assigned North American head Alan Batey to work with GM dealers on serving the customers, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the recall. She also involved GM quality and customer service chief Alicia Boler-Davis as well as Bingol, who is in charge of GM’s governmental affairs in Washington, the person said.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

443	Federal auto-safety regulators were under fire Monday for failing to act quickly on evidence that faulty ignition switches in some General Motors cars were killing the engine and preventing air bags from inflating in accidents, contributing to 13 deaths.Consumer advocates — including Joan B. Claybrook, a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — called on NHTSA to investigate why it did not demand that GM recall affected models after learning as early as 2007 that an ignition defect could inadvertently stall a car, disabling its air bags. “While GM bears complete responsibility for failing to recall these vehicles by 2005, when it knew what the defect was and how to fix it, NHTSA has responsibility for failing to order a recall by early 2007, when it knew what the effect was and how to fix it,” Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, wrote in a letter to NHTSA seeking an independent probe of the agency’s response. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said late Monday that the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which he chairs, will investigate whether GM or NHTSA missed “something that could have flagged these problems sooner. If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened.” NHTSA officials defended the agency’s actions, saying they have long been concerned about the potential stalling problem. The agency launched probes of suspicious crashes caused by the faulty switches, but investigators struggled to pinpoint the exact cause of the accidents amid a fog of complaints and complications, including the introduction of a new type of air bag around the time of the earliest incidents. “NHTSA receives and screens more than 40,000 consumer complaints each year and pursues investigations and recalls wherever our data justifies doing so,” the agency said in a statement. “As a data-driven organization, ­NHTSA is constantly looking for ways to improve our process so we can better identify serious safety defects in the nation’s vehicle fleet and ensure that those defects are remedied.”GM on Monday named a former federal prosecutor to head its inquiry into why the automaker waited more than a decade to recall vehicles equipped with the problematic ignition switches, which now number more than 1.6 million. Anton “Tony” Valukas, chairman of the law firm Jenner & Block, will work with GM’s general counsel, Michael Millikin, on the probe. In addition, attorneys from the law firm King & Spalding will help conduct the investigation into the chain of events leading up to GM’s announcement last month that the vehicles would be recalled.GM chief executive Mary Barra said she has demanded an “unvarnished” picture of GM’s handling of the ignition problem.The automaker, which has been enjoying a resurgence following its descent into bankruptcy in 2009, issued the recall last month to fix the faulty switches, which sometimes cause cars to turn themselves off, stalling the engine and shutting down electronic components, including air bags. The company has said that the problem is more likely to occur when cars go off the road or when the ignition switch is jostled by, for example, the driver’s knee or an overloaded key ring. GM has linked the problem to 13 deaths, and consumer activists suspect the total could rise. The recall covers the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, and the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Sky and Chevrolet HHR.As it draws pointed scrutiny for its response, NHTSA is conducting its own investigation. Last week, it issued an order to GM, demanding answers to 107 questions about what happened in the decade between the first indication that the switch was faulty and last month’s recall. In what some agency officials called an unprecedented request, NHTSA wants the names of employees involved in investigating the problem. It also wants to know details about complaints GM received from owners, the names and correspondence of employees involved in the company’s attempts to fix the problem, and reasons why proposed design changes were not implemented in 2004 and 2005, soon after the problem first surfaced.Among the first victims of the faulty switch was Amber Marie Rose, 16, a Southern Maryland girl who died in 2005. Rose was legally drunk, she was not wearing a seat belt and her Chevrolet Cobalt was going 69 mph in a 25-mph zone when the car crashed early one morning, according to an investigation of the accident.Still, an investigator hired by Rose’s adoptive parents determined that her car’s ignition switch had gone into the “accessory” position during the accident, preventing her air bags from deploying. And Rose likely would have been saved by a functioning air bag, the investigator concluded, said Rose’s birth mother, Laura Christian.In 2006, the automaker disclosed the problem to dealers in a technical-service bulletin that resulted in repairs to 474 cars. In 2007, a research team looking into the Rose crash informed federal safety regulators about the potential link between the defective ignition switches and the failure of air bags to deploy.Another seven years would pass before last month’s recall. “It is absolutely appalling,” Christian said in an interview Monday, “that it took so long for this recall to happen.” 	Science

General Motors
 said it hired  Tony Valukas, chairman of the Chicago-based law firm Jenner & Block, to help lead its internal investigation of how the company handled an ignition-switch failure linked to at least 13 deaths.Valukas, who was appointed by the U.S. Justice Department to examine Lehman Brothers' failure in the wake of the Wall Street firm's collapse, will work closely with GM's general counsel, Michael Millikin to understand why a recall on the affected vehicles wasn't issued years ago.  In addition to attorneys from Jenner & Block, GM said attorneys from the law firm King & Spalding are also part of the team conducting the investigation.GM is conducting its own investigation, even as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration digs deeper into what steps the company took to investigate engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating from 2004. GM has until April 3 to answer specific questions in a 27-page NHTSA order issued March 4.Only recently did GM issue a recall on 1.6 million affected vehicles,  all currently out of production, citing a flaw in the design that would allow heavy key rings or jarring to cause ignition switches on some Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn vehicles to slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. GM has linked the defect to at least 23 crashes, including the 13 deaths.
NHTSA could fine GM as much as $35 million, which would be the most ever by the U.S., if it finds the Detroit-based automaker didn’t pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective. The agency can also seek criminal charges.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra, under fire just weeks after being promoted to the top spot, has promised to solicit ""an unvarnished report of what happened"" and said the company will hold itself accountable and improve its processes to make sure it doesn't happen again.Regarding the potential hit to GM's reputation, Barra wrote in an email to employees: ""The vehicles we make today are the best in memory and I’m confident that they will do fine, on their own merits. And our company’s reputation won’t be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward.  What is important is taking great care of our customers and showing that it really is a new day at GM."" "	Science

General Motors is currently dealing with a 1.6-million-vehicle recall that’s been linked to a nine-year ignition switch defect, and while a high-profile case like this normally comes with an onslaught of lawsuits, GM says those filed before its 2009 bankruptcy are not its problem.The defect that GM first learned about in 2004 has been linked to 31 crashes with 13 deaths in the U.S., but under terms of its bankruptcy, GM is not liable for injuries that arose before then. That means anyone involved in an accident in one of the recalled vehicles who filed a lawsuit before 2009 will have to negotiate with “old GM” for recoveries on their claims. However, “new GM” is assuming responsibility for legal actions brought on after 2009. While this seems rather questionable, a bankruptcy lawyer told The Wall Street Journal that “In a bankruptcy sale, generally speaking the [asset] buyer is not going to be liable for any claims the old company is liable for.”Among the recalled vehicles include several of old GM’s vehicles such as the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, 2003-2007 Saturn ION, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, and 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky. The vehicles were recalled because it was found that if there’s too much weight on the key ring, or if the car hits a rough patch of road, the ignition could inadvertently turn off, resulting in a loss of power. If the vehicle is still in motion, this could cause a crash – and because the vehicle is off, airbags may not deploy.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the timeliness of GM’s latest ignition switch recall. Under federal regulations, an automaker must inform the NHTSA of a potential safety problem within five business days after discovering the issue, and GM has admitted it’s known about the problem since 2004. However, neither GM nor the NHTSA have provided details on the timing of known injuries.Source: The Wall Street JournalAdvertisement

A list of the most popular browsers can be found below.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration may have known as early as 2007 about a faulty ignition problem in over 1 million General Motors cars.That’s according to a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Joan Claybrook, who has asked for an agency probe as it investigates GM. The car king may have known about the malfunction since 2004 but didn’t order a recall until last month.The recall includes various versions of the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, the Pontiac G5 and Solstice and the Saturn Ion and Sky.All models were suspected of a potentially deadly fault in which the car’s engine, electronics and air bags sometimes inadvertently switches off when the key jiggles.Questions are now being raised over why the recall wasn’t issued sooner. In 2005, the NHTSA conducted three special crash investigations into why GM’s new air bags weren’t deploying, so suspicions should have been spiked. There were also at least six complaints logged in the NHTSA database about the problem from as far back as 2007. That year, the NHTSA and GM met to discuss a crash involving an involuntary engine switch-off.GM says 31 crashes and 13 deaths are connected to the malfunction, including one involving 15-year-old Amy Rademaker of Woodville, Wis.“These were our children! And [GM] just acted like they don’t matter! They may not have mattered to GM, but they mattered to us,” said Rademaker’s mother, Marhie Beskau.Marhie BeskauMother of car crash victimGeneral Motors is conducting an internal investigation now. The company’s new CEO, Mary Barra, announced last week that she will personally direct the recall. It’s her first major test as leader of the company, which went through bankruptcy restructuring in 2009.In a statement published Wednesday, GM said, “In addition to getting NHTSA the information they need, we are doing what we can now to ensure our customers’ safety and peace of mind. We want our customers to know that today’s GM is committed to fixing this problem in a manner that earns their trust.”The NHTSA is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Its mission includes investigating safety defects in motor vehicles.In 2013, the NHTSA says, automakers issued 632 recalls involving 22 million vehicles. Seven million of those vehicles were recalled because the agency initiated an investigation. More than 15 million were because the automakers reported problems.In the case of this GM recall, the question is why the government didn’t step in earlier, given that the agency first investigated the problem back in 2007.The NHTSA probe of GM is expected to continue for six months. If it finds GM knew of the defect and did not report it within the first five days, the company could face a fine of $35 million.What went wrong with the GM recall?Did the NHTSA know about the problem?What happens now?We asked a panel of experts for the Inside Story.This panel was assembled for the broadcast of “Inside Story.”For future hard-hitting conversations, find Al Jazeera America on your TV.

449	Reuters Staff6 Min Read* Barra learned of ignition-switch issue two weeks after becoming CEO * Lawyer leading probe investigated Lehman collapse * U.S. safety regulators also investigating GM’s handling of recall * Two outside law firms in probe have conducted work for GM By Ben Klayman DETROIT, March 10 (Reuters) - In her first big test as General Motors Co’s chief executive, Mary Barra has taken a hands-on approach behind the scenes in directing the automaker’s response to ignition-switch problems that have been linked to 13 deaths. On Monday, GM said the team conducting an internal probe ordered up by Barra of the recall of more than 1.6 million vehicles is being led by the lawyer who investigated Lehman Brothers after the financial services firm collapsed in 2008. Barra has been heavily focused on the recall since she learned of the issue in late January, about two weeks after she took over as the industry’s first female CEO. The No. 1 U.S. automaker has said the recall to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off will begin next month when it has the replacement parts. Most of the affected vehicles are in North America. Barra apologized for the recall and sent a letter last week to employees promising an “unvarnished” look at the recall that is occurring 10 years after the issue first came to light. She has not granted any interviews on the matter. “Mary believes that her time is best spent on making the recall work as smoothly as possible for our customers,” GM chief spokesman Selim Bingol said in an email. “Meanwhile, GM is keeping our customers informed about the recall while working to provide timely responses to questions from regulators.” While recalls are not unusual, the number of fatalities involved and the way GM handled this one stretching over the past decade has the potential to cost the company hundreds of  millions of dollars in fines and possible legal damages, in addition to tarnishing its reputation. U.S. safety regulators have also opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent the automaker a list of 107 questions about the recall to answer by April 3. In addition to ordering up the apology and crafting the letter to employees with Bingol’s help, Barra has designated assignments for top executives related to the recall, according to a person familiar with the situation. Barra placed global product development chief Mark Reuss in charge of working with supplier Delphi Automotive to obtain the replacement parts as quickly as possible and assigned North American head Alan Batey to work with GM dealers on serving the customers, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the recall. She also involved GM quality and customer service chief Alicia Boler-Davis as well as Bingol, who is in charge of GM’s governmental affairs in Washington, the person said. Anton “Tony” Valukas has been named head of GM’s internal probe. He is chairman of the law firm Jenner & Block, whose attorneys are helping with the investigation of the recall. Valukas could not immediately be reached for comment. Co-leading the investigation with Valukas is the automaker’s general counsel, Michael Millikin. Sources previously said GM’s team of investigators had begun interviewing employees involved in the problems surrounding the ignition switch, which first came to the company’s attention in 2004. Valukas, a former U.S. attorney, was the court-appointed examiner in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. His probe resulted in the so-called Valukas report, a 2,200-page document released in 2010 which detailed the causes of the financial services firm’s spectacular collapse. The report showed how Lehman had long used accounting gimmicks to bolster its balance sheet, and had been insolvent for many weeks prior to its Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy filing. It did not find extensive wrongdoing at the Wall Street bank. GM went through a U.S. government-led bankruptcy in 2009, which is the dividing line between what became known as “old GM” and “new GM.” Valukas also served as lead counsel for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s four-year investigation of “old” GM’s pension accounting, which concluded with no allegations of fraud or intentional misconduct. Jenner & Block, which is based in Chicago, was the lead outside counsel for GM’s initial public offering in 2010 when it returned to the market as a public company following its bankruptcy restructuring. Another lawyer who works at Jenner is Robert Osborne, GM’s general counsel from 2006 to 2009. The law firm referred questions to GM. In addition, GM said lawyers from the firm King & Spalding are also part of the team investigating the recall. The firm also referred questions to GM. King & Spalding, founded in Atlanta, represented “new” GM during some of its bankruptcy proceedings, in addition to some other litigation work since then. Partners at the firm include Gary Grindler, the former U.S. deputy attorney general under Eric Holder. Regarding the ignition-switch issue, GM previously said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the “run” position, turning off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring. The company said last week that the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

451	General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) executives had hoped to begin this year anew, in recovery from the company's 2009 Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it seems the past will continue to haunt the world’s second-largest auto manufacturer. GM just began a recall of 1.6 million cars to replace faulty ignition switches that can cause the car to shut down in motion, leading to hazardous driving conditions that have been linked to 13 fatalities and 31 crashes in the U.S. since 2004.The company has until April 3 to respond to more than 100 questions from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (click here to read the PDF) about the recall. The NHTSA itself is under scrutiny because it dismissed hundreds of complaints from car owners over the years about cars stalling in motion.As more details are released about the recall, it’s becoming clear GM has a corporate bureaucracy that’s slow to respond to safety issues. CEO Mary Barra said recently that she was only informed of the problem on Jan. 31 after deliberations by internal committees who insulate corporate higher-ups, and Robert Lutz, who was vice chair of global product development when subordinates were studying the ignition switch issue, last week vehemently denied to the New York Times knowing anything about the issue.The NHTSA could slap the automaker with a civil fine of up to $35 million if it finds that GM knew about a safety problem and didn’t inform the federal safety watchdog within the legally required five business days. The company could also face charges from the U.S. attorney’s office, which is currently going after Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, for the way it disclosed sudden acceleration problems in its vehicles. But $35 million is a relative drop in the bucket compared to what it pays out in product liability claims, which amounted to $601 million in 2012, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last year.How much GM could wind up paying out in product liability claims related to the ignition switch recall will depend on how many accidents occurred after the company was turned from General Motors Corporation (aka the “old GM”) into General Motors Company, the “new GM.”When it comes to litigation, the new GM in not liable for any sins committed by the old company. “The analogy is if someone committed fraud while he was alive; you can go after the assets of the estate of the deceased, if there are any assets,” said John Bird, a bankruptcy lawyer for Fox Rothschild LLP in Wilmington, Del. “The old GM is dead. This is a new GM, with new hands and new shareholders.”Essentially the new GM is protected from legal liabilities of the old GM, which still exists as a shell company but doesn’t have any assets that could pay out liability claims. That means that anyone harmed by the ignition switch flaw prior to GM’s restructuring will not be able to sue the new GM. So far only two of the 13 fatalities in accidents involving cars that fall under the recall and recorded by the NHTSA occurred after GM’s bankruptcy: one involving a Pennsylvania woman in January 2010 and another from a female driver in Georgia in March of the same year.The recall includes six models: the Chevrolet Cobalt (2005-2007 model years), the Chevrolet HHR (2006-2007), the Pontiac Pursuit (2005-2006), the Pontiac Solstice (2006-2007) the 2007 Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion (2003-2007) and the 2007 Saturn Sky.Subscribe	Science
452	General Motors (NYSE: GM) and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration are under scrutiny for taking years to address an ignition switch problem that is tied to 13 deaths.Last month, the Detroit automaker recalled 1.6 million vehicles. NHTSA has launched an investigation into how long it took GM to admit there was an issue and take action.GM learned about at least one incident of ignition switch problems in the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt around the time of the vehicle's launch, according to a chronology report submitted to NHTSA.The report says GM employees were able to replicate the ignition switch issue, where the key moved out of the “run” position when the driver accidentally contacted the key or steering column. An engineering inquiry was opened to investigate the issue. Although there were potential solutions, the inquiry was closed without action “after consideration of the lead time required, cost, and effectiveness of each of these solutions,” according to the report.The Wall Street Journal says that GM's chronology of events surrounding the issue shows the company is “burdened by bureaucratic complexity” to the point that it wasn't able to decide how to address a fatal defect in its vehicles. Related: Mary Barra Takes Charge, Launches Internal Inquiry Into GM Recall“Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot once said that where he came from, if you see a snake, you kill it. But at General Motors, if you see a snake, you hire a consultant on snakes, then you form a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years,” the WSJ article says.GM announced Monday it hired Jenner & Block Chairman Anton Valukas to help lead an internal investigation into how the company handled the ignition switch failures, Bloomberg reports.NHTSA's actions are also being examined. Despite receiving more than 260 complaints over 11 years, federal safety regulators never investigated the problem, the New York Times reports. A NYT analysis of consumer complaints submitted to NHTSA found that complaints about potentially dangerous shutdowns due to faulty ignition switches were received roughly twice a month since February 2003, but the agency repeatedly responded that there wasn't enough evidence to launch an investigation into the issue. The NYT says the complaints involved six of the models currently being recalled by GM. Senior Kelley Blue Book analyst Jack Nerad told Benzinga the fact that the complaints on the ignition issue occurred across several different brands might have masked the scope of the problem. “NHTSA relies, in part, on reporting by vehicle manufacturers and typically engages in very frank exchanges with manufacturers in determining if there is a safety issue, how big the issue is and what can be done to rectify it,” Nerad said in an email. “To do its job effectively NHTSA needs to communicate with auto manufacturers. Both NHTSA and the individual auto manufacturers have the same goal – providing safe transportation to the buying public. At times the two sides do differ on what is required to obtain that result.”Watchdogs and Revolving DoorsThe issue could also be how GM and NHTSA work together. Automotive News suggests that the federal agency is getting too cozy with the automaker, referring to NHTSA as the “watchdog that didn't bark.” The article cites a Sherlock Holmes story where the detective observes that the watchdog didn't bark on the night of a murder, indicating the murderer must have been someone friendly with the dog. Automotive safety expert Byron Bloch told Benzinga an ongoing problem for NHTSA is its revolving door between the government and the automotive industry. “I think it's important to realize that NHTSA is frequently politicized to the point that decision-makers inside have come from the auto industry directly,” said Bloch. When reports of ignition switch issues began trickling in around 2005, Jacqueline Glassman was the acting administrator of NHTSA. Glassman had previously worked as a senior counsel for Chrysler. Jeffrey Rosen was the general counsel for the U.S. Department of Transportation. Before that, he worked for Kirkland & Ellis, who has represents GM. “If you want to put it in this framework, the top two decision makers were from Chrysler and GM, respectively,” said Bloch. “Might their decisions be gently or more overtly influenced because of these affiliations?”Posted-In: Automotive News Byron Bloch Jack NeradNews Wall Street Journal Rumors Media General Best of Benzinga© 2018 Benzinga.com.

458	"General Motors launches an internal investigation into how the company handled a recall linked to more than a dozen deaths. GM recalled roughly 1.4 million cars last month because of a problem with the ignition switch that could cause cars to easily be shut off while driving. The faulty switch is linked to 31 frontal crashes and at least 13 deaths over several years. Documents submitted to federal safety regulators reveal some GM engineers knew of the problem 10 years ago but did not immediately treat it as a safety concern. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether GM responded quickly enough  in recalling the car.

461	"The warnings are written in a stark plain text file maintained on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website. ""I'm just happy my family is alive,"" one driver wrote of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, after the car's engine suddenly went dead after driving over a small rock. ""I don't think this is the first and last time this will happen, and hopefully a recall will take place before someone dies from this flaw.""Another complaint tells a harrowing story about a woman who was driving with her four-year-old son in a 2005 Cobalt when the car suddenly died on the highway. ""She was able to coast off the highway, but was almost rear-ended by a larger vehicle that was following her,"" the complaint notes. More than 260 complaints were made during the past 11 years about Cobalts and other General Motors cars that suddenly shut off while driving, or about two complaints per month, according to an analysis by The New York Times. With GM's recall of 1.6 million cars last month, the finger pointing has begun. While the NHTSA is investigating the ""timeliness"" of the recall, others are asking whether the government agency missed picking up on a trend hidden within its long ledger of complaints. The NHTSA has been criticized before for missing patterns, with the agency coming under fire more than a decade ago for failing to flag problems with Ford Explorers with Firestone tires, The Times notes. But the NHTSA is defending its track record when it comes to the GM cars, noting that there wasn't enough evidence to support an investigation. The 260 complaints represent only about 0.018 percent of all cars that have been recalled. ""Regarding the recent recall of certain GM vehicles, the data available to NHTSA at the time did not contain sufficient evidence of a possible safety defect trend that would warrant the agency opening a formal investigation,"" the agency said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch. The NHTSA said it uses ""a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall."" Customer complaints are only one source of information that the agency considers, as well as early warning data, crash investigations and industry-related websites, the agency said. One thing is for certain: GM knew of the defect, which happens when a key chain is jostled and shuts off the ignition, as early as 2004.  GM was aware of the problem with the debut of its 2005 Chevy Cobalt, but said in a chronology provided to the NHTSA that it decided to close an inquiry because of ""lead time required, cost and effectiveness.""A former head of the NHTSA is asking the Department of Transportation to investigate into why the agency didn't demand a recall earlier, according to USA Today. Joan Claybrook, who is now an activist, said the agency ""failed to carry out the law"" by not requiring GM fix the problems earlier. The finger-pointing probably isn't much consolation to the families and friends of those involved in the 31 crashes and 13 deaths linked to the defect. According to the complaints listed in the NHTSA's database, there may have been many more close calls. ""The car stalled once this morning and then completely shut down without warning,"" one woman wrote of her husband's 2005 Cobalt, which she noted had shut down while on the highway. ""My husband thought he was going to die.""

462	"SUBSCRIBE TODAY AND SAVE 84%PAID SUBSCRIBERS GET A FREE SUBSCRIPTION TO THE AUTOMOBILE MAG APPLE EDITION!Owners of cars involved in General Motors’ wide-ranging ignition-switch recall may be out of luck if they want to sue the automaker. The Wall Street Journal reports that bankruptcy proceedings mean GM is safe from liability lawsuits over any accidents that occurred before 2009.When the “old GM” was dissolved in bankruptcy in 2009, its responsibility for any product-liability lawsuits vanished as the company’s creditors broke up its remnants. The “new GM” established post-bankruptcy is still responsible for vehicles produced before 2009, but it cannot be held liable for accidents or injuries that occurred before then.“It is true that new GM did not assume liability for claims arising from incidents or accidents occurring prior to July 2009,” a spokesman confirmed today in an emailed statement. “GM is focused on ensuring the safety and peace of mind of our customers involved in the recall… Our principle throughout this process has been to the put the customer first, and that will continue to guide us.”The Journal reports that anyone pursuing litigation against “old GM” — that is, suing over something that happened before 2009 — must work with mediation lawyers and typically won’t receive much compensation. However, the automaker that most people recognize today as General Motors will only be subject to lawsuits if somebody was injured or killed in one of the affected vehicles after July 2009.The GM ignition switch recall was first announced in February, covering 619,122 vehicles in the U.S. The problem stems from a faulty ignition-switch design, which can allow the switch to inadvertently move from “Run” to “Off.” That can stall the car while driving, possibly precipitating an accident. Worse yet, GM found that the ignition often toggled “Off” in an accident, disabling the airbags and thus increasing the severity of the accident.Later in February, GM expanded the recall to cover a total of 1.37 million cars in the U.S. The automaker said that had reports of 31 crashes in which the airbags didn’t deploy because the ignition switch toggled off, and reports of 13 deaths due to the problem. The recall covers the 2003-2007 Saturn ION, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice, 2006-2007 Saturn Sky, 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, and 2007 Pontiac G5.

General Motors announced this week that a team conducting a probe of the company's ignition-switch recall that's been linked to 13 deaths is being led by the same lawyer who investigated Lehman Brothers in 2008, according to Reuters.Anton ""Tony"" Valukas is the chairman of the firm Jenner & Block, whose attorneys are apparently helping with investigation of February's recall of over 1.6 million vehicles.Valukas has not commented publically regarding the news yet.Michael Millikin is co-leading the investigation with Valukas, according to Reuters.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a letter to employees last week that GM will take an ""unvarnished"" look at theThe recall supposedly came approximately 10 years after issue first came to light.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent the automaker a list of 107 questions about the recall. GM has until April 3 to answer each question.The recall was issued to correct a condition that could allow the engine and other components to turn off unintentionally. Most of the vehicles affected by the recall are in North America.Valukas was the court-appointed examiner in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. His probe eventually resulted a 2,200-page document released back in 2010 that is now known as the ""Valukas report.""The report detailed the causes of the financial services firm's collapse, and showed how Lehman used accounting gimmicks to boost its balance sheet.Additionally, lawyers from the firm King & Spalding are also part of the team looking into the recall, according to Reuters.2018 BMW 520i And 525d Specs Reveal Four-Cylinder Engine & 6.6-Second Acceleration Rate2018 Mercedes-Benz S Class To Offer A New Kind Of Mobile Yoga System?Dallara’s New Sports CarIs Coming Out Soon!

467	"General MotorsGeneral MotorsNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — General Motors has appointed a team to investigate events leading up to the automaker’s recall of roughly 1.4 million cars for a problem that has been tied to at least 13 deaths.The internal investigation is being led by attorney Anton Valukas, chairman of Chicago law firm Jenner & Block and by GM’s own General Counsel, Michael Millikin. Valukas is best known for his work on the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. He is also a former United States attorney.Attorneys from the firm of King & Spalding are also participating in the investigation, GM said in an announcement.A representative of Jenner & Block was not immediately able to comment on the appointments. A spokesman for King & Spalding said he cannot confirm their involvement.In a letter to employees released earlier this month, GM chief executive Mary Barra had announced that an internal investigation would be launched “to give us an unvarnished report” about what happened.GM issued the recall in February of Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5 cars and then expanded that recall to Saturn Ions, Chevrolet HHRs, Pontiac Solstices and Saturn Sky models because a problem with the switch can cause the cars to easily be shut off accidentally while driving. The ignition switch problems caused 31 frontal crashes and at least 13 deaths over several years.Documents submitted to federal safety regulators reveal that some GM engineers knew of the problem with the switch 10 years ago but did not immediately treat it as a serious safety concern. Even after the seriousness of the problem was recognized, internal communication problems caused delays in dealing with it.Barra, who became CEO of the automaker in January, said in her letter that the problems were first brought to the attention of her team “a few weeks ago.” She said she led a committee that acted immediately when informed about the problem.“We will hold ourselves accountable and improve our processes so our customers do not experience this again,” Barra said in her letter.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether GM responded quickly enough in recalling the car. Under federal regulations, an automaker has five days from the moment it learns of a potential safety defect to alert federal regulators to the issue. The maximum fine for failing to do so is $35 million.Filed in: News Topics: General Motors They also need to look at faulty 2006 Pontiac G6 models as well. I bought American to support “built in America” production. Had I had known that these cars were sent out of production incorrectly assembled, I would have reconsidered.   I have had nothing but problems with power steering, and dash lights. My dash resets itself when initially starting, including the odometer completely going blank. All while driving!! How safe! Piece of junk, and it will be the last GM model car that I will ever purchase! Looks like I will swing the other way and buy foreign.Comments are closed.

Valukas served as investigator of the collapse of the Lehman Brothers Holdings.According to the automaker, Valukas together with Michael Millikin, general counsel of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), will handle the investigation. Lawyers from King & Spalding are also part of the investigating team.General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is conducting an internal investigation in response to the 27-page order from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to outline the steps the automaker is carrying out to resolve engineering concerns and consumer complaints on the issue dating back in 2004. The automaker has until April 3 to answer specific questions in the order that was issued on March 4.According to Bloomberg, the NHTSA could impose as much as a $35 million penalty against General Motors if it finds out that the automaker didn’t implement a recall when it was aware that the cars were defective. The NHTSA could also file criminal charges against the automaker.General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) recently stated that heavy key rings or jarring could cause ignition switches to slip out of position, cutting off power, and deactivating air bags on some Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn vehicles. The automaker found that the defect was connected to at least 23 crashes, including crashes that resulted in 13 deaths.Mary Barra, chief executive officer of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), emphasized in her note to employees last week that the automaker “acted without hesitation” to deal with the recall over the past few weeks, but that they have much work ahead.General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) already recalled 778,562 Cobalts and G5s, as well as an additional 800,000 Saturn Ions (2003 to 2007 models), Chevrolet HHRs (2006 to 2007 models), Pontiac Solstices (2006 to 2007 models) and Saturn Skys (2006 to 2007 models). The automaker also said that the 2005 to 2006 Pontiac Pursuit and 2007 Opel GT sold in Canada and Europe respectively were included in the recall.In a separate report, Greg Martin, spokesperson for General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) denied reports that the automaker ignored customer complaints. According to him, the company was monitoring complaints, but he did not provide further details regarding the investigation into failures related to the ignition switches.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!

471	Reuters Staff2 Min ReadDETROIT, March 10 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Monday that the team conducting a probe of the company’s handling of an ignition switch recall linked to 13 deaths includes attorneys from both inside and outside the No. 1 U.S. automaker. The team conducting a review of last month’s recall of more than 1.6 million vehicles is being led by Tony Valukas, chairman of the law firm Jenner & Block, and by GM’s general counsel, Michael Millikin, the company said.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra previously said in a letter to employees that the company would take an “unvarnished” look at the company’s handling of the recall, which occurred about 10 years after the issue came to light. GM’s recall was to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off. GM previously said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the “run” position, turning off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring. The company said last week that the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended,"" U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the committee, said in a statement Monday.In the Senate, Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, has asked for a subcommittee hearing on the matter from Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said a person familiar with the matter who didn’t want to be identified because the request isn’t public. The Detroit News reported the request earlier.GM said earlier Monday it has hired Jenner & Block Chairman Anton Valukas, who served as a U.S. Justice Department-appointed examiner of the downfall of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., to help lead an internal probe of the handling of the ignition-switch recall.NHTSA officials have also expanded a probe of the recall.Upton oversaw a subcommittee in 2000 that investigated the rollovers of Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires, a problem that followed years of complaints and was eventually linked to 271 deaths.In response, Congress passed the Tread Act, sponsored by Upton, that requires automakers to report complaints of defects in a timely matter to NHTSA and make it easier to identify and track automotive safety defects.Upton, in calling for hearings, said he is particularly interested in how an automaker and U.S. safety regulators, despite the added oversight, once again failed to recognize safety defects and trends.“Here we are over a decade later, faced with accidents and tragedies, and significant questions need to be answered,” Upton said in a statement. “Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner? Americans deserve to have the peace of mind that they are safe behind the wheel.""GM said it is already cooperating with NHTSA and planned to cooperate with the House committee's investigation, as well. ""We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts,"" GM said in a statement late Monday. GM's internal investigation of the flaw that prompted the recall of 1.6 million vehicles is being conducted jointly by a team led by Valukas and GM’s general counsel, Michael Millikin, the automaker said in a statement. Attorneys from the law firm King & Spalding are also part of the team conducting the investigation, GM said.The internal company probe is running parallel to a query from NHTSA on what steps the company took to investigate engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating from 2004.GM has until April 3 to answer specific questions in a 27-page order the safety agency issued March 4.GM last month said heavy key rings or jarring can cause ignition switches on some Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn vehicles to slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. GM has now linked the defect to at least 23 crashes, including the 13 deaths.The auto-safety regulator could fine GM as much as $35 million, which would be the most ever by the U.S., if it finds the automaker didn’t pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective. The agency can also seek criminal charges.Reputation at stakeGM CEO Mary Barra said March 4 she would lead senior executives monitoring progress on the recall, which includes Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 small cars. The company’s reputation may be driven by how it responds, she said.GM “has acted without hesitation” to address the recall in the past few weeks, Barra said in a note on a Web site last week for employees. “We have much more work ahead of us.”The initial recall on Feb. 13, limited to 778,562 Cobalts and G5s, was widened less than two weeks later to include more than 800,000 additional vehicles. Those vehicles include 2003-2007 Saturn Ions, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and the 2006-2007 Saturn Sky. Other models affected are the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada and the 2007 Opel GT sold in Europe.GM North America President Alan Batey said in a Feb. 25 statement expanding the recall to the Saturn Ions and other models that the company’s “process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been.” The automaker is preparing a second timeline related to the Feb. 25 recall expansion.Valukas, 70, is a former U.S. attorney.Bloomberg, David Phillips and Mike Colias contributed to this report.

General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) on Monday hired Anton Valukas, chairman of law firm Jenner & Block, to lead its internal investigation of the company’s handling of complaints that led to at least 13 deaths and a massive global recall of 1.6 million GM vehicles. Valukas led the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation into the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.A report in The New York Times published over the weekend said that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) received an average of two complaints a month since 2003 related to a defect in the ignition switch in a number of GM models. The NHTSA declined to investigate because “there was not enough evidence of a problem to warrant a safety investigation.”The problem is that the weight of the key ring, perhaps coupled with road conditions, may cause the ignition switch to be jarred from the “run” position, turning off the engine and shutting down the car’s electrical power, which causes the airbags to fail to deploy.The New York Times also noted that since 2003, GM has reported no less than 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries related to the recalled vehicles. How many of the injuries and deaths are related to the ignition switch defect is not clear. The NHTSA announced its own investigation two weeks ago.The recalled vehicles are the 2005 to 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2003 to 2007 Saturn Ion, 2006 and 2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2006 and 2007 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky. The company also recalled 2,300 Opel GTs in Europe and an unspecified number of 2005 to 2006 Pontiac Pursuits sold in Canada. GM no longer manufactures any of these models.GM faces a maximum fine of $35 million if the NHTSA investigators find that it failed to notify the agency within five days after learning of the defect. The larger liability for the company might be the result of lawsuits related to the deaths and any injuries caused by the defect.GM shares were down about 2.2% Monday morning, at $36.88 in a 52-week range of $27.11 to $41.85.By Paul Ausick"	Science

480	"Safety activist Joan Claybrook - a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) - has sought an investigation into why the NHTSA failed to demand a recall of General Motors' (GM) vehicles affected by a potentially fatal problem involving ignition switches.	Pointing out the NHTSA became aware of the problem with GM ignition switches way back in 2007, Claybrook said that the agency's inactivity on the recall of the affected vehicles shows that it had ""failed to carry out the law."" Claybrook is of the opinion that the NHTSA should have forced GM to fix the problem back then, in 2007.	Claybrook's call for a probe into the NHTSA's evident lapse comes within weeks of the GM's recall of 1.37 million cars in the US in February. Revealing that the recall is related to faulty ignition switches which can shut off power to the front airbags, GM said that it has received reports of 31 crashes and 13 deaths linked to the ignition-switch problem.	The vehicles which have been recalled by GM include the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky.

481	"NEW YORK — Less than a month after General Motors said it would recall 1.6 million cars because of a defective ignition switch, the automaker faces an arduous task: fixing the cars.The process, particularly for older vehicles like the ones GM is recalling, is time-consuming and requires many steps, from designing the new parts, testing them to make sure they solve the problem, finding and informing owners, and completing the repairs. It will not be until early April, GM said, that the repairs will begin.On Friday, GM started sending out the first recall letters to registered owners, telling them a fix is coming.Under the heading “Important Safety Recall,” the letter contains a stern, if unusual, warning: “Remove all items from your key ring, leaving only the vehicle key.”That’s because if the defective ignition switch is jostled or even if the key chain is too heavy, it can turn off the engine and the car’s electrical system, disabling the air bags.GM said it had linked the defect to 31 crashes and 13 deaths since it was first alerted to the problem in 2004.The letter, which does not advise drivers to stop using the car, also tells owners the replacement parts “are not currently available.”For the older cars being recalled by GM, simply getting the part made is a challenge for the automaker.The recall covers six models: 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices; and the 2007 Saturn Sky.Alan Adler, a GM spokesman, said that the supplier, Delphi, needed to prepare the machines that would make the part before it could be mass-produced.Once the part is made, a second letter will be sent to registered owners telling them to schedule an appointment at a dealership. That letter, GM said, will go out later this month. The parts are not expected to arrive at dealerships any sooner than early April.The recall of the 1.6 million vehicles, including nearly 1.4 million in the United States, is large, but it is one of many. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that over the past seven years, its investigations have resulted in more than 900 recalls, covering more than 50 million vehicles.For models like the Cobalt, GM will use an automotive consulting firm, R.L. Polk, which performs computer searches of state motor vehicle registrations to find current owners through vehicle identification numbers. But they are harder to find.“These are second- and third-owner cars now, because of their age,” Adler said.  And some of those who are reached may not respond, he predicted. 
Adler said that General Motors would soon establish a website where owners could get more information, and that it has monitored Facebook discussions of the Cobalt as well.

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQsFederal safety officials commissioned a special probe into the crash of a 2004 Saturn Ion, similar to the 2006 shown, in which the airbags didn't inflate. The car is among 1.37 million GM has recalled for the airbag issue.(Photo: GM Wieck)A former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking for a probe of why NHTSA knew as early as 2007 about a potentially fatal problem with General Motors ignition switches, but didn't demand a recall.Now a safety activist, Joan Claybrook says the safety agency ""failed to carry out the law"" when it didn't force GM to fix the problem back then.GM recalled 1.37 million cars in the U.S. last month because faulty ignition switches can shut off power to the front airbags. GM says it knows of 31 crashes and 13 deaths linked to the fault. Claybrook asked the Department of Transportation, of which NHTSA is a unit, to probe ""the failure of"" NHTSA ""to require the recall"" earlier. GM last month recalled the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky.The switches unexpectedly can move from ""run"" into ""accessory,"" killing power to the airbags and other systems. Heavy key rings can exacerbate the problem. GM says drivers awaiting the fix should be sure nothing is attached to their ignition keys. NHTSA did not immediately respond to Claybrook's slap. But the agency in past cases has noted that it's easy, in hindsight, to say a problem should  have been obvious, but at the time, the cases might have been so few that they were statistically inconsequential and wouldn't have attracted attention. In the GM case, NHTSA paid extraordinary attention. It triggered three Special Crash Investigations, which are probes performed by outside investigators working under contract and reporting to NHTSA and the DOT. Claybrook says that makes it even more unlikely that NHTSA should not have seen the problem clearly. The agency commissioned the SCIs because it wanted to know why then-new ""smart"" airbags were failing to deploy in some GM crashes: The probes:•Aug. 15, 2005, into a July 29, 2005, Maryland crash of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt that killed Amber Marie Rose, 16.That report, by Calspan Research of Buffalo, said the ignition switch was in ""accessory,"" and the front airbags did not deploy. The report also noted that the driver was unbelted, impaired by alcohol, and accelerating under a wide-open throttle to 69 mph when the car slammed into trees and rolled.NHTSA and GM met and discussed the crash in 2007,  according to GM's own timeline.•Nov. 26, 2006, into the October 2006 crash of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt that killed Amy Beskau, 15, of Wisconsin, a front-seat passenger. A rear-seat passenger also died. The driver survived. None were wearing safety belts. The SCI report in April 2007, by the Indiana University Transportation Research Center, said the switch was in ""accessory,"" and the airbags didn't deploy. The report noted, however, at least six complaints in the NHTSA database at the time about power being lost when the keys moved inadvertently to ""accessory.""•March 15, 2004, into the crash of a 2004 Saturn Ion in Pennsylvania in January of 2004. No one was killed. The SCI report by Calspan noted that the crash was severe enough that the bags ""probably"" should have deployed, but didn't.The position of the ignition switch wasn't  noted, but Calspan reported anomalies in the data from the car's ""black box"" recorder consistent with a loss of engine power prior to the crash."

More than 1.4 million GM cars will soon be under recall over a problem with the ignition switch that causes the vehicle to shut off in certain conditions and also disables the airbags; 13 fatal crashes have been linked to the problem by GM themselves. As owners of 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalts, Pontiac G5s, Saturn Ions and other cars await the recall…AdvertisementThe Times story also says that since 2003 GM has reported at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries involving their six recalled cars, though it isn't clear how many of those deaths are linked to the ignition switch problem. The Times combed through 8,000 complaints about the recalled models in NHTSA's public database and found more than 260 related to a moving car stalling unexpectedly. It's not clear from their story, however, how many of those stalls are related to the ignition problem. AdvertisementThe complaints cited include ""frightening scenes in which moving cars suddenly stalled at high speeds, on highways, in the middle of city traffic, and while crossing railroad tracks."" The most recent complaint was filed Thursday. ""When the vehicle shuts down, it gives no warning, it just does it,"" wrote one driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. ""I drive my car to and from work praying that it won't shut down on me while on the freeway.""Another driver wrote of the same model: ""Engine stops while driving — cannot steer nor brake so controlling the car to a safe stop is very dangerous.""AdvertisementThe agency responded with formulaic letters to people who filed the complaints, the Times reports. The newspaper spoke to one owner who said she never got a response after complaining her daughter's 2005 Cobalt shut down three times in normal driving.NHTSA responded to the newspaper by saying they have recalled more than 55 million cars in the last seven years, and that while they use a variety of methods to search through complaints, ""260 complaints amounts to about .018 percent of the vehicles under recall."" But Carter-era agency director Joan Claybrook criticized NHTSA in the Times story, saying they do not have trend-spotting methods under control. In doing our own coverage of the GM recalls, I've been genuinely surprised at the number of Jalopnik commenters who have chimed in to say they owned the cars covered under this recall and experienced shutdowns themselves. It seems pretty clear by now that this is a real problem, and now NHTSA may not escape criticism of it either.  AdvertisementCheck out the full Times story here."	Science

485	"General Motors CEO Mary Barra, shown here with former CEO Dan Akerson, says that GM will take an ""unvarnished"" look at the events that led to the recent recall of 1.6 million vehicles. Photo credit: General Motors.Last month, General Motors  announced the recall of 1.6 million vehicles built between 2003 and 2007, for faulty ignition switches.We at The Motley Fool often say that most auto recalls are no big deal in the grand scheme of things, and that's true. Nowadays, most recalls in the auto business involve a problem that could cause a safety issue. Typically, it's a defective part that is caught quickly -- often in the automaker's own internal testing -- and the comany is proactive in making sure it's repaired promptly. It's a nuisance for owners of the affected cars, and an expense and a hassle for the automaker, but rarely much more than that.This is not one of those recalls.The problem with these ignition switches is this: The impact of just the right kind of crash can make the switches switch from the ""run"" position to the ""accessory"" position. If the ignition switch isn't in the ""run"" position during a crash, the airbags won't go off. What are the odds of that happening? They're not zero: apparently, there have been 31 crashes in which this happened. Thirteen people have died.That's bad. But it gets worse. GM has known about this problem for years. It fixed the switches in 2007. But the company didn't do a recall at the time.Why? Good question. GM's legal department is now conducting an investigation to find out.Of course, GM was in turmoil in 2007, and for several years after, as it spiraled into a wrenching bankruptcy. It's a different company now, under very different management. As Fool contributor John Rosevear explains in this video, the one good thing in this situation is that GM's new leadership is determined to find out what happened, to take responsibility for fixing it, and to make sure it doesn't happen again.A transcript of the video is below.Free report: Learn from Warren Buffett's greatest wisdomWarren Buffett has made billions through his investing and he wants you to be able to invest like him. Through the years, Buffett has offered up investing tips to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. Now you can tap into the best of Warren Buffett's wisdom in a new special report from The Motley Fool. Click here now for a free copy of this invaluable report.Hey Fools, it's John Rosevear. So you may have heard that General Motors has this enormous recall going on. The story in a nutshell is that they recalled 1.6 million older vehicles, these are all 2007 model year or older, Chevy Cobalts, Pontiac G5s, Chevy HHRs, Pontiac Solstices, and Saturn Skys, they've been recalled [for] faulty ignition switches.The issue is that the switches can fail in a way that you'd never notice until you were in a huge crash and the car's airbags failed to deploy, basically, the switch's mechanism can become loose enough that it gets knocked into an ""off"" position, technically the ""accessory"" position, by the force of the crash, and of course airbags don't deploy when the car isn't switched on. There have apparently been 31 crashes where this actually happened, where investigators determined that the airbags in one of these affected GM vehicles should have inflated and they didn't, and 13 people have died.As safety defects go in modern cars, this one's a doozy.We often say that most recalls are no big deal, and that modern cars are very very safe, and that's true, but this one is a big deal. It's a big embarrassment for GM, a big potential liability, but it's interesting how GM has chosen to handle this.GM is of course a very different company now than it was back in 2007; it has been through bankruptcy, and it's under completely different senior management that has taken a completely different approach, and I would argue a much much healthier approach. What's different, first of all, is that GM has made public a chronology that shows that the company first learned of the potential for a problem way back in 2004, they outlined the whole investigative process, and it shows that they probably should have done this recall in 2007 when they figured out what the issue was and implemented a change to the ignition switch design that solved the problem.Just owning up to that is likely to land them in some legal hot water. I mean, it seems awfully likely that they'll get sued by some of the victims here, but in addition, it's a big violation of federal regulations. Automakers are required to tell the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within five days if they become aware of a safety defect. The maximum penalty is a $35 million dollar fine.It looks like what happened is that some balls got dropped within GM, which is somewhat understandable given all the massive internal turmoil that GM went through between 2007 and 2011 or so, but even though it's arguably understandable it's still bad. It really looks like GM as an institution kind of dragged its feet while people were getting killed and injured in defective cars.But what's good about this, to the extent that there's anything good here, what's good is that GM's current leadership is finally stepping up and owning this. They did release the chronology, and GM North America chief Alan Batey actually apologized, he had a letter published in USA Today that apologizes for the defect and GM's slow response to it. Batey's letter says: ""Today's General Motors places our customers' satisfaction and safety at the center of all we do. That is why we are deeply sorry for the events that led to our recent recall.""And he goes on to really take a shot at Old GM. He says, ""It is fair that we are getting questions about our commitment to customers when you consider the way we did business and some of the vehicles we built at times during the past decade."" Reuters reported on Wednesday that a team of GM attorneys is now conducting an internal investigation, questioning employees, a day after GM CEO Mary Barra sent a letter to employees saying that GM would take an ""unvarnished"" look at what happened.I have to say, as a GM shareholder, I hate that this safety defect exists, I hate that it took them so long to deal with it, but I do like the way that GM is finally stepping up here. It's nice to see management trying hard to do the right thing. Thanks for watching, and Fool on.

General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) has recalled 1.6 million cars worldwide to repair a defect that led to 13 deaths. According to a report in The New York Times, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) received an average of two complaints a month since 2003 related to the defect. The NHTSA declined to investigate because “there was not enough evidence of a problem to warrant a safety investigation.”The problem is that the weight of the key ring, perhaps coupled with road conditions, may cause the ignition switch to be jarred from the “run” position, turning off the engine and shutting down the car’s electrical power which causes the airbags to fail to deploy.The Times reviewed the NHTSA’s public database and examined nearly 8,000 complaints made against the recalled models looking for instances of trouble with the ignition switch. It found more than 260 cases where a moving car unexpectedly stalled.But how culpable is the NHTSA? The agency’s response to the NYT’s story is that over the past 7 years the agency has issued 929 recalls affecting more than 55 million vehicles and that the agency “uses a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall.” The 260 complaints about the GM cars is about 0.018% of the vehicles under recall according to the agency. How that is relevant is not immediately obvious.The NHTSA’s failure does not let GM entirely off the hook. Under a law passed in 2000, automakers are legally required to report to the NTHSA any claims the carmakers receive that blame a vehicle defect for a serious injury or death. The NYT report notes that since 2003, GM has reported no fewer than 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries related to the recalled vehicles. How many of the injuries and deaths are related to the ignition switch defect is not clear.Any federal penalties the company may face are likely to pale in comparison to the civil claims from the survivors of the 13 dead and who knows how many injured. GM’s new CEO Mary Barra has said that she leading a group of the company’s senior executives who will be monitoring the company’s response to the NHTSA’s investigation. That’s probably not how she wanted to start off her new job.By Paul Ausick"	Science
488	"The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has asked General Motors to provide details about what it knew and when surrounding ignition switch failures linked to 13 deaths. The failures have resulted in a recall of 1.6 million Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Saturn vehicles.In a 27-page order, NHTSA has requested that GM provide it with specifics on the steps it took to investigate engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating from 2004. The agency has requested the report by April 3rd.In February, General Motors said that heavy key rings or jarring could cause ignition switches on affected cars to move out of position, thereby cutting power and deactivating air bags. The agency also stated on its website that “Falsifying or withholding information in response to this special order may also lead to criminal penalties of a fine or imprisonment of up to 15 years, or both.”The General has stated that it is fully cooperating with the probe, welcoming “the opportunity to help the agency have a full understanding of the facts,” said  Alan Adler, a GM spokesman, in an e-mailed statement.“In addition to getting NHTSA the information they need, we are doing what we can now to ensure our customers’ safety and peace of mind,” Adler added. “We want our customers to know that today’s GM is committed to fixing this problem in a manner that earns their trust.”General Motors CEO Mary Barra stated that she would guide senior executives in monitoring progress on the recall, adding that the automaker’s reputation may be driven by how it responds.GM “has acted without hesitation” to address the recall in the past few weeks, reads Barra’s note from a GM employee website. “We have much more work ahead of us.”NTHSA’s order contains 107 questions about the events leading up to the recall, including the 10-year timeline the automaker provided regulators on February 24th. The agency also requested all GM documents used to prepare the timeline, as well as details about each of the 23 crashes the automaker linked to the defect, and all depositions and testimony from lawsuits.The agency also requested details surrounding the following items:NHTSA spokesperson Nathan Naylor said in a statement that, “We are a data-driven organization, and we will take whatever action is appropriate based on where our findings lead us.”Adding more complexity to the situation is a GM technical service bulletin to dealers from 2006 describing the issue; GM didn’t issue a a recall until 2014. Notably, a research team informed U.S. automotive safety regulators in 2007 of a possible link between defective ignition switches and airbags not deploying.In a statement dated February 25th, GM stated that it was “deeply sorry”, while CEO Barra stated on March 5th that the automaker has commenced an internal investigation to provide an “unvarnished report on what happened.”To note, the initial recall on February 13th was limited to 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s was expanded less than two weeks later to include more than 800,000 additional vehicles, including 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice, and the 2006-2007 Saturn Sky. Other affected models not sold in the U.S. include the Canadian-market 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuit and the European-market 2007 Opel GT.— Chris EcclestoneNews editor focusing on business, financial, and sales coverage who loves anything on wheels, especially if it's fast.As soon as I heard about the recall, I contacted my daughter in Manhattan. Her first experience was traumatic when going over a pothole in the high speed lane, lost power to the car. Trying to maneuver to the breakdown lane w/o power or blinkers during rush hour was harrowing. I told her to contact her local GM dealer about the recall and they said come back if you get a recall in the mail. Not the kid glove treatment that CEO Mary Barra has been talking about. I also asked my daughter to check on getting a free loaner car for the day when they do replace the ignition switch. Answer was something like “no way”. BTW, she drives a 2006 HHR.This very alarming, GM dealer network is worthless at best.I just don’t understand how GM is responsible for these cars! We are talking about cars that were made years ago and are way passed the warranty! How long are car makers responsible for taking care of repairs on a car? Please stop saying that these switches are faulty! They lasted for 10 years in some cases! That’s not the definition of a bad part! I think people just have it in for GM and will take any chance they get to bury them! Simply pathetic!Lay off this shit Brian. Its the simple fact GM sold vehicles they KNEW were dangerous and could cause serious injury… Do some research on “Product Liability”; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_liabilityIt doesnt matter if it exceeded warranty, it had a defect that caused deaths…Then it’s not a defective part! If the part last for years then there is no way it’s defective! If the part was defective then why didn’t they all fail? Did every ignition go bad? These are greedy people with their hands out hoping to get paid! Let me ask you something, have you ever had a car that needed the ignition replaced? Was that car out if warranty? If so what did you do? Have it replaced! Please don’t think I’m just trying to stir the pot! I’ve driven plenty of these cars and used to own one myself and do you know how many problems I had with the?NONE! Total And Complete BS!If the part is detective then don’t you think 95% of the components involved would fail? Did that happen? No!If it wasnt defective then we wouldnt even have this situation. If it wasnt defective then they wouldnt be recalling 1.4 Million cars would they? The problem in question is that GM KNEW about the potential safety hazard and STILL sold the vehicles, acting like the problem wasnt even there. THAT is grounds for lawsuits, especially now that people died. Maybe you dont understand, but as consumer we have the RIGHT to get compensation for a companies defective product. And yes, it IS defective whether you like it or not.Did the part make it past the warranty? If the answer is yes then it’s not defective! We have this problem cuz are looking for a hand out!I would be looking for a handout too if i paid $30K for a car and it has a potentially deadly part. Also, some of these deadly accidents occured when the warranty was still in play. Also, you should rethink your approach, a warranty cannot help a person when the defective part already caused an accident or even death.I dont think you understand warranties…At all…
(You might want to take notes.)Warranty:
In contract law, a warranty has various meanings but generally means a guarantee or promise which provides assurance by one party to the other party that specific facts or conditions are true or will happen. This factual guarantee may be enforced regardless of materiality which allows for a legal remedy if that promise is not true or followed. (GM knew of the problem but chose not tell the public the car had a problematic ignition, thus lying.)Breach of Warranty:
A breach of warranty occurs when a product is defective, or broken, to an extent that cannot be reasonably expected by a buyer. (A buyer does not expect the ignition to become faulty from the factory and cause a severe accident)Product Liability:
Product liability is the area of law in which manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make products available to the public are held responsible for the injuries those products cause. Although the word “product” has broad connotations, product liability as an area of law is traditionally limited to products in the form of tangible personal property. (This shows that even though the product exceeded warranty, it is still the manufactures problem IF it causes injuries)Types of Manufacture Liability:
Section 2 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability distinguishes between three major types of product liability claims:– manufacturing defect
– design defect
– a failure to warn (GM is being accused of this)The simple fact is, GM knew of the issue, sold the cars anyways. And because the issue CAUSED DEATHS, it is now the manufactures problem for simple negligence. GM wouldnt be in hot water if they had just fixed the issue before selling the vehicles, but instead they ignored the public safety and sold these cars anyways…Its sickening and they deserve every bit of heat. Warranties do not matter in situations that cause deaths. And it doesnt matter how many Cobalts are still on the road, it only takes a handful to ruin the whole batch. How can you defend GM for being guilty for something so obvious? I cant believe you are so filled with Bias that you cant allow yourself to believe GM did something wrong.If some of the cars failed during the warranty then they would have been fixed during that time which is normal! These people are making a mountain out of a nothing just to get some money they don’t deserve! Why doesn’t the driver have to take any of the responsibility of being able to pull the car over when there is a loss of power! Have you ever been in a car when the car died, I have pulling over to the side of the road is not a major problem! But I guess GM is responsible for that too!These ignitions are not what caused deaths it was the drivers inability to bring his or her car to a safe stop! You don’t need power steering to steer, you don’t need power brakes to stop, and you don’t need hazards to let other people know your having a problem! Let me ask you would this have been a big deal if she just ran out gas? The same thing would of happened the car would of just shut off and they would of had to get the car over to the side of the road regardless! You give the victim a pass! I don’t!Would be nice if they converted the cars to push button ignition as the fix. Anyone know how difficult this would be?I find this rediculous, $500 is pennys when buying a car in todays economy. This a PR disaster, this is a week offer at best. While Scott has some great points, when you consider the challenges of modern driving and many of the conditions out their, a Cobalt stalling out without warning would be incredibly dangerous. Considering most of the time I am being talegated if my car was to suddenly shut off I would be toast before I could even begin to figure out what was happening. Lets say I just purchased a used Cobalt from auction for $4,000 with around 100,000 miles, a dealer is going to mark that up 2 to 3 grand. So the average joe is going to buy a used 05 to 07 Cobalt for around 7 to 8 grand. Now what is it owrth, maybe $2,000 to $3,000 at auction. GM has to protect its consumers wether buying used or new, this is the concept they failed to understand in pre-bankruptsy but I believe they do get this now. While the old GM is at fault here, lets not forget that most people dont know or care if their was an old or new GM. New GM has finally come out of the closet with this and has a responsibility as well as new GM to resolve the issue as well as any lawsuits that come from further investigation. I believe their will be some serious accountability reprecusions from this. Lets hope new GM stays focused on the course and continues to develop class leading products.GM is not responsible for lawsuits pre bankruptcy 2009! They are only responsible for the cost of repairing the switches! These are not my words they are fact! Old GM New GM! I still want to know why the victims in all of this are not held to a higher standard when it comes to driving? Cars lose power everyday and people deal with it, they find their way to the side of the road! Why these switches any different?Your email address will not be published.

489	"NEW YORK — Federal safety regulators received more than 260 complaints over the past 11 years about General Motors vehicles that suddenly turned off while being driven, but they declined to investigate the problem, which GM now says is linked to 13 deaths and requires the recall of more than 1.6 million cars worldwide.A New York Times analysis of consumer complaints submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that since February 2003 it received an average of two complaints a month about potentially dangerous shutdowns, but it repeatedly responded that there was not enough evidence of a problem to warrant a safety investigation. The complaints — the most recent of which was filed Thursday — involved six GM models that the automaker is now recalling because of defective ignition switches that can shut off engines and power systems and disable air bags. GM said the first recall notices were mailed Friday to vehicle owners.Many of the complaints detailed frightening scenes in which moving cars suddenly stalled at high speeds, on highways, in traffic, and while crossing railroad tracks. A number of the complaints warned of catastrophic consequences if something was not done.“When the vehicle shuts down, it gives no warning, it just does it,” wrote one driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. “I drive my car to and from work praying that it won’t shut down on me while on the freeway.”Another driver wrote of the same model: “Engine stops while driving — cannot steer nor brake so controlling the car to a safe stop is very dangerous.”To the mounting complaints, the safety agency sometimes responded with polite but formulaic letters similar to one it sent in December 2010 to Barney Frank, then a congressman from Massachusetts, who had written on behalf of a distraught constituent whose 2006 Cobalt kept stalling. In the letter to Frank, the agency said it had reviewed its database of complaints to determine if a “safety defect trend” existed. “At this time, there is insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation,” the letter concluded.Failure to recognize a pattern in complaints has been a problem for the safety agency before. In the late 1990s, it was criticized for failing to detect a wave of highway rollovers in Ford Explorers with Firestone tires, a problem that was eventually linked to 271 deaths.In response, Congress passed a law in 2000 requiring automakers to report to the safety agency any claims they received blaming defects for serious injuries or deaths, so the government would not have to rely only on consumer reports. Since 2003, GM has reported at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries involving the now-recalled cars, according to a review of agency records. Though the records mention potentially defective components, how many of these records were related to the ignition problem is unclear. Even with that additional information, regulators appear to have overlooked complaints of  shutdowns.“We need to make it clear to both industry members and regulators that adverse events must be immediately reported and analyzed to ensure public safety,” said Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, a Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The panel’s staff is set to meet with the safety agency Monday.The safety agency has repeatedly suggested that it failed to act over the years because of a lack of a critical mass of evidence that suggested a problem beyond isolated incidents.In a statement e-mailed to The New York Times, a spokesman noted that over the past seven years, the agency’s investigations in other cases have resulted in 929 recalls of more than 55 million vehicles. The agency “uses a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall,” the statement said. The agency said 260 complaints are about 0.018 percent of the vehicles under recall.The recall has thrown GM into turmoil just as it was emerging from the shadow of bankruptcy under new chief executive Mary T. Barra, and as the agency stepped up pressure on GM in late February by launching an investigation into the “timeliness” of GM’s “defect determination.” Last week the agency sent the company 107 questions, demanding it explain why it had waited so long to recall the vehicles.But the Times review of thousands of complaints stored in the agency’s public database raises questions about the agency’s own timeliness. The newspaper analyzed nearly 8,000 complaints about the recalled models to find instances when drivers may have been affected by faulty ignition. The 260-plus total includes only complaints that mentioned a moving car stalling unexpectedly. It does not include the complaints filed about basic ignition problems on these models, like trouble starting or stopping a car’s engine, or failures of the power steering mechanism, even though these could have stemmed from an inadvertent ignition shutdown. People may have filed multiple complaints about the same car.Greg Martin, a GM spokesman, said the company monitors complaints to the NHTSA about its vehicles but declined to say how the agency responded to ignition switch complaints.By the time the agency wrote to Frank in 2010, it had received more than 170 complaints about unexpected stopping or stalling of the recalled GM models, and 35 specifically for the 2006 Cobalt. The Cobalt has been a particularly problematic model for GM. 

The recall covers six models: 2005-07  Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices and the 2007 Saturn Sky. Both the agency and GM are warning motorists that if they must drive a recalled vehicle, no keys other than the car key should be on the key chain to eliminate  jostling that could shut down the ignition.In announcing the recalls, GM said the ignition defect may have been responsible for 31 accidents and 13 deaths, but it has declined to disclose the names of those who died or  details of the crashes. GM said it had been “involved in claims and lawsuits” related to the ignition problem, but did not disclose how many settlements had been reached.© 2018 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC"	Science

In the letter to Frank, the agency said it had reviewed its database of complaints to determine if a “safety defect trend” existed. “At this time, there is insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation,” the letter said. Failure to recognize a pattern in individual complaints has been a problem for the safety agency before. In the late 1990s, it was criticized for failing to detect a wave of highway rollovers in Ford Explorers with Firestone tires, a problem that was eventually linked to 271 deaths.In response, Congress passed a law in 2000 requiring automakers to report to the safety agency any claims they received blaming defects for serious injuries or deaths, so the government would not have to rely only on consumer reports.Since 2003, GM has reported at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries involving the now-recalled cars, according to a review of agency records. Though the records mention potentially defective components, how many of these records were related to the ignition problem is unclear. Even with that additional information, regulators appear to have overlooked disturbing complaints of engine shutdowns.“We need to make it clear to both industry members and regulators that adverse events must be immediately reported and analyzed to ensure public safety,” said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The panel’s staff is scheduled to meet with the safety agency Monday.The safety agency has repeatedly suggested that it failed to act over the years because of a lack of a critical mass of evidence that suggested a problem beyond isolated incidents.In a prepared statement emailed to The New York Times, a spokesman noted that over the past seven years, the agency’s investigations in other cases have resulted in 929 recalls of more than 55 million vehicles. The agency “uses a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall,” the statement said. The agency said 260 complaints amounts to about .018 percent of the vehicles under recall.The recall has thrown GM into turmoil just as it was emerging from the shadow of bankruptcy under the leadership of a new chief executive, Mary Barra, and as the safety agency stepped up pressure on the company in late February by launching an investigation into the “timeliness” of GM’s “defect determination.” Last week, the agency sent the company 107 questions, demanding it explain why it had waited so long to recall the vehicles.But the review of thousands of complaints stored in the agency’s public database raises questions about the agency’s own timeliness. The newspaper analyzed nearly 8,000 complaints about the recalled models to find instances when drivers may have been affected by faulty ignition. The 260-plus total includes only complaints that mentioned a moving car stalling unexpectedly. It does not include the complaints filed about basic ignition problems on these models, like trouble starting or stopping a car’s engine, or failures of the power steering mechanism, even though these could have stemmed from an inadvertent ignition shutdown. People may have filed multiple complaints about the same car.Greg Martin, a GM spokesman, said the company monitors complaints to the NHTSA about its vehicles but declined to say how the agency responded to ignition switch complaints.By the time the agency wrote to Frank in 2010, it had received more than 170 complaints about unexpected stopping or stalling of the recalled GM models and 35 specifically for the 2006 Cobalt. The Cobalt has been a particularly problematic model for GM. In 2010, the automaker recalled some of the vehicles for power steering failure, and in December 2005, it told dealers that owners should remove unessential items from key chains.The expectation of the 2000 law, known as the Tread Act, was that the measure would help government regulators flag trends months or years earlier than they would if they relied on consumer complaints alone. The law was used to punish Toyota for failing to report unintended accelerations; that company paid a civil penalty of $16.4 million under the act. But it does not appear to have helped the government identify problems faster.Joan Claybrook, who led the safety agency during the Carter administration, said, “The ability to spot trends is a huge issue, and NHTSA has not got it under control by any means.”Many consumers who approached the agency were met with institutional silence.“This is a safety issue if there ever was one,” wrote Laura Denti of Toms River, N.J., in a letter both to GM customer service and to the safety agency on June 29, 2005, citing three times when her daughter’s new 2005 Cobalt shut down abruptly while in operation. The letter also referred to a previous letter she had sent.“I don’t recall them ever responding,” Denti said in an interview last week.The recall covers six models from years between 2003 and 2007: 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices and the 2007 Saturn Sky. Both the agency and the company are warning motorists that if they must drive a recalled vehicle, no keys other than the car key should be on the key chain to eliminate potential jostling that could shut down the ignition.In announcing the recalls, GM said the ignition defect may have been responsible for 31 accidents and 13 deaths, but it has declined to disclose the names of those who died or the dates, location or other details of the crashes.The company said it had been “involved in claims and lawsuits” related to the ignition problem but did not disclose how many settlements had been reached.Hilary Stout, Danielle Ivory and Matthew L.

493	"	General Motors Co needs to get through its ignition-switch recall and the resulting federal investigation quickly to avoid any lasting damage to its brand, but the federal probe could keep the problem in the public eye for at least six months.	Analysts and academics warn that a misstep by GM could leave it with a lingering headache, something Toyota Motor Corp experienced from 2009 to 2011 with recalls linked to sudden acceleration. The Japanese automaker was criticized for being slow to react to complaints and initially blaming the drivers.	GM is currently interviewing employees dating back to the discovery in 2004 of the problem with the ignition switch, which has since been linked to 13 deaths, sources previously said. Meanwhile, U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigation into whether the No. 1 U.S. automaker reacted swiftly enough in its recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles.	GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Tuesday in a letter to GM employees said she deeply regretted the circumstances but was pleased with the company's response and the focus will be on customer safety and satisfaction.	Moving past the recall and related fallout will be critical to ensure the Detroit company continues the rebound since its 2009 bankruptcy reorganization, analysts said.                         	""They need to get past this as quickly as possible,"" said George Cook, a marketing professor at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester.	""You cannot be reactive in dealing with the American car-buying public,"" added Cook, formerly an executive at Ford Motor for 10 years. ""You have to be proactive and I think they'll be forgiving if it's not really, really serious. People have short memories about that stuff.""	GM's recall was to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off.	GM has said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the ""run"" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.	The company said last week that the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.	Trent Ross, senior vice president of reputation and risk management at Ipsos Public Affairs, said GM needs to take ownership of the issue right away. Several analysts lauded Barra for her letter.	""GM needs to show it's doing the right thing,"" he said. ""And Mary Barra has to demonstrate that the buck stops with the CEO.""	In her letter to employees, Barra emphasized that whether the company's reputation and sales suffer is not the issue.	""Our company's reputation won't be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward,"" she said.	GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in addition to recall costs it has not outlined. Analysts agreed the big costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.	Toyota, for instance, settled economic-loss claims in its case for more than $1 billion and is negotiating settlement of hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits. It also is in talks to settle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department for a reported $1 billion.	However, that has not hurt sales or stopped Toyota from ranking highly in consumer quality rankings conducted by J.D. Power and Associates, suggesting that any damage to GM could be fleeting, analysts said.	GM's case could take time, however, given the Detroit company's internal probe and the investigation opened by the NHTSA, which Cook said could last at least six months.	Allan Kam, a former enforcement attorney with NHTSA, said the agency's 107-question ""special order"" was unusual. ""I've never seen one quite as detailed as this one,"" he said.	Kam speculated GM would prefer to settle the NHTSA probe in a way that would allow its answers not to be published widely. However, the mounting pressure on NHTSA, with members of Congress sending letters of inquiry, may make that outcome unlikely.Copyright: Thomson Reuters 2014	""They need to get past this as quickly as possible,"" said George Cook, a marketing professor at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester.

500	" By Ben Klayman DETROIT, March 7 (Reuters) - General Motors Co needsto get through its ignition-switch recall and the resultingfederal investigation quickly to avoid any lasting damage to itsbrand, but the federal probe could keep the problem in thepublic eye for at least six months. Analysts and academics warn that a misstep by GM could leaveit with a lingering headache, something Toyota Motor Corp experienced from 2009 to 2011 with recalls linked tosudden acceleration. The Japanese automaker was criticized forbeing slow to react to complaints and initially blaming thedrivers. GM is currently interviewing employees dating back to thediscovery in 2004 of the problem with the ignition switch, whichhas since been linked to 13 deaths, sources previously said.Meanwhile, U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigationinto whether the No. 1 U.S. automaker reacted swiftly enough inits recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Tuesday in a letter to GMemployees said she deeply regretted the circumstances but waspleased with the company's response and the focus will be oncustomer safety and satisfaction. Moving past the recall and related fallout will be criticalto ensure the Detroit company continues the rebound since its2009 bankruptcy reorganization, analysts said. ""They need to get past this as quickly as possible,"" saidGeorge Cook, a marketing professor at the Simon Business Schoolat the University of Rochester. ""You cannot be reactive in dealing with the Americancar-buying public,"" added Cook, formerly an executive at FordMotor Co for 10 years. ""You have to be proactive and Ithink they'll be forgiving if it's not really, really serious.People have short memories about that stuff."" GM's recall was to correct a condition that may allow theengine and other components, including front airbags, to beunintentionally turned off. GM has said the weight on the key ring, road conditions orsome other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to moveout of the ""run"" position, turning off the engine and most ofthe car's electrical components. GM has recommended that ownersuse only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring. The company said last week that the initial replacementparts will be available in early April. Trent Ross, senior vice president of reputation and riskmanagement at Ipsos Public Affairs, said GM needs to takeownership of the issue right away. Several analysts lauded Barrafor her letter. ""GM needs to show it's doing the right thing,"" he said. ""AndMary Barra has to demonstrate that the buck stops with the CEO."" In her letter to employees, Barra emphasized that whetherthe company's reputation and sales suffer is not the issue. ""Our company's reputation won't be determined by the recallitself, but by how we address the problem going forward,"" shesaid. GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from U.S. NationalHighway Traffic Safety Administration in addition to recallcosts it has not outlined. Analysts agreed the big costs couldcome from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe. Toyota, for instance, settled economic-loss claims in itscase for more than $1 billion and is negotiating settlement ofhundreds of personal-injury lawsuits. It also is in talks tosettle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department for areported $1 billion. However, that has not hurt sales or stopped Toyota fromranking highly in consumer quality rankings conducted by J.D.Power and Associates, suggesting that any damage to GM could befleeting, analysts said. GM's case could take time, however, given the Detroitcompany's internal probe and the investigation opened by theNHTSA, which Cook said could last at least six months. Allan Kam, a former enforcement attorney with NHTSA, saidthe agency's 107-question ""special order"" was unusual. ""I'venever seen one quite as detailed as this one,"" he said. Kam speculated GM would prefer to settle the NHTSA probe ina way that would allow its answers not to be published widely.However, the mounting pressure on NHTSA, with members ofCongress sending letters of inquiry, may make that outcomeunlikely.

510	Boy, did GM step in it. Last week, General Motors expanded its recall (you know, the one that has been ten years in the making) to nearly 1.37 million vehicles after 13 people have reportedly died as a result of faulty ignitions. Now that the American automaker has at long last issued the recall, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has submitted 107 questions to GM regarding the safety issue and the manner in which it has been addressed.The Saturn Ion was among the recalled vehicles.The 107 questions span 27 pages in a document sure to make Mary Barra wish her promotion had come just a few months later. And GM doesn’t have too long to reply; the government administration has ordered a response by April 3rd.One of the questions asks for “precise detail” on how exactly the ignition issue kept some airbags from deploying while another queries, “Did GM perform any work in 2008 (relating) to the defect that is the subject of this recall, including by investigating crashes in any of the recalled vehicles in which the airbags did not deploy?” The feds also want info on every vehicle that was reported to GM to have had an issue related to the ignition, and they want to know who at General Motors was involved.The NHTSA is also seemingly baffled by Alan Batey’s statement issued after the recall in a press release. They want an explanation for his statement that the “process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been.”Batey was not available for comment on what foot in mouth actually tastes like.GM North American President, Alan Batey, sans foot in mouthRecalled vehicles include 2006-2007 Chevy HHRs, 2005-2007 Chevy Cobalts, 2003-2007 Saturn Ions, 2006-2007 Saturn Skies, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solsices, and 2007 Pontiac G5s.Timothy Moore takes his leadership inspiration from Michael Scott, his writing inspiration from Mark Twain, and his dancing inspiration from every drunk white guy at a wedding.

511	"  Less than two months after taking over General Motors and being hailed as a sign of how much the country's largest automaker has changed, CEO Mary Barra is facing a huge test.   Can she steer GM through a recall investigation that threatens to damage the automaker's reputation?  The automaker's latest headache is how it handled the recall of 1.37 million vehicles sold in the U.S. with a faulty ignition key. Some of those keys, while in the ignition, could inadvertently move out of the ""run"" position, turning off the engine and some of the electrical components. One of the side effects was that the airbags could unintentionally be turned off.    According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there have been 31 accidents and 13 deaths related to the faulty keys.   (Read more: NHTSA to GM: Hand over recall data)   For GM, the issue—which involves 2003 to 2007 models—dates to 2004, when questions about the key surfaced. But it wasn't until early in 2014 that the automaker issued a recall. That time lag is at the heart of a special order from the legal counsel office at the NHTSA   What did GM executives know?   When did they know it?   And did they move as quickly as the law requires to issue a full recall of the ignition keys?   (Read more: GM expands recall of cars with ignition problem)   Those are just a few of the questions the agency wants GM to answer. In a letter sent to the automaker on Tuesday—requesting detailed answers to 107 questions related to the recall—it's clear federal investigators are not treating this probe as a routine inquiry. NHTSA wants answers, and it wants them by April 3.     Barra knows just how serious the investigation is for her company. The same day NHTSA sent its list of questions to GM, she announced the automaker had ""launched an internal review to give us an unvarnished report on what happened.""   In a letter to employees, Barra said, ""First and foremost, everything we are doing is guided by one unwavering principle: Do what is best for our customer. Customer safety and satisfaction are at the heart of every decision we make.""   There's no reason to believe Barra is not sincere. She knows General Motors has to move quickly to stop the lingering questions about the safety and quality of its models.   It didn't help matters that Alan Batey, the new president of GM's operation in North America, issued a statement in late February, saying GM's handling of the recall investigation ""was not as robust as it should have been.""   Allan Kam, a former senior enforcement attorney for NHTSA who is now an automotive safety consultant, said the latest moves by federal investigators were noteworthy. ""This is not a routine inquiry,"" Kam said. ""I've never seen a special order from NHTSA this detailed.""  Lingering impact for GM?   Since GM issued the first recall for ignition keys in early February, the story has festered and steadily gained more attention. It has prompted GM to twice issue public apologies, where the company has said the recall is not an indication of how the automaker wants to conduct business. On paper that sounds good. In reality, the NHTSA inquiry casts serious doubt on GM's claims.   It's unclear what impact the recall has had on sales, as harsh winter weather has hurt business for all automakers. The company most recently reported a sales dip of 1 percent in the month of February.   (Read more: GM, Ford extend discount war through March)   In any case, Barra and her leaders need to move quickly to end the ongoing questions about the safety of GM cars and trucks.    It doesn't matter that the models in question with this recall are no longer being built.   What matters is the perception, fair or not, that General Motors dragged its feet announcing a recall surrounding the deaths of 13 people.   When Barra was selected as CEO, many said it was symbolic of the new GM. She was held up as the hope GM would drive even further from the bad habits that tarnished its reputation before it slid into bankruptcy. Ironically, it's the actions of GM in those ""pre-bankruptcy"" years—when it was known as a slow-moving conglomerate that reacted slowly to change—that are now haunting the automaker and its new chief.  —By CNBC's Phil LeBeau.

U.S. safety regulators are demanding that General Motors turn over documents detailing what the company knew when about a dangerous ignition problem that has been linked to 13 car-crash deaths. (AP Photo/Mark Duncan, File)DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators are demanding that General Motors turn over reams of documents and other data showing what the company knew and when it found out about a dangerous ignition problem that has been linked to 13 car-crash deaths.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating how GM handled the problem, which triggered the global recall of 1.6 million older-model compact cars. GM has acknowledged it knew of the ignition troubles a decade ago but didn't recall the cars until last month.In a 27-page order sent to GM Tuesday, NHTSA demanded pictures, memos, electronic communications, engineering drawings and other data to answer 107 questions. The reply, which must be signed under oath by a company officer, is due on April 3.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to know how automaker handled ignition problem

March 6, 2014
by Tom Krisher, The Associated Press

DETROIT—Safety regulators in the United States are demanding that General Motors (GM) turn over reams of documents and other data showing what the company knew about a dangerous ignition problem that has been linked to 13 fatal car crashes.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating how GM handled the problem, which triggered the global recall of 1.6 million older-model compact cars.GM has acknowledged it knew of the ignition troubles a decade ago but didn’t recall the cars until last month.In a 27-page order sent to GM, NHTSA demanded pictures, memos, electronic communications, engineering drawings and other data to answer 107 questions.The reply, which must be signed under oath by a company officer, is due April 3.GM spokesperson Alan Adler said this week the company is co-operating.NHTSA wants the documents to determine if GM delayed its response or withheld evidence.In either case, it could fine GM up to US$35-million.Automakers are required to inform NHTSA of safety defects within five days of discovering them.Such a fine would be a record for NHTSA, but essentially is pocket change for GM, which made US$3.8-billion last year.Included in the order is a series of questions about when GM discovered the ignition problem in 2004 and the identity of employees involved in finding and replicating it.The order asks what fixes GM considered, “including the lead time required, costs and effectiveness of each of the solutions.”On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s from the 2005 to 2007 model years.Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts from 2003 to 2007, and Chevrolet HHR wagons and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 to 2007.Facts surrounding the recall are embarrassing for GM and could scare away consumers.Since leaving a painful bankruptcy in 2009, GM has cut bureaucracy, improved vehicle quality and is quicker to recall cars when problems occur.However, its admission that recall procedures were lacking 10 years ago shows how the old culture can still haunt the automaker.In an effort to reassure employees and customers, GM’s new CEO, Mary Barra, promised an “unvarnished” internal investigation to figure out what happened and prevent it from recurring.“We want our customers to know that today’s GM is committed to fixing this problem in a manner that earns their trust,” GM’s Adler said.Even as NHTSA pressures GM for details, safety advocates say the agency bears some blame for the automaker’s slow recall response.NHTSA said in a statement this week that it’s a data-driven agency “and we will take whatever action is appropriate based on where our findings lead us.”The maximum fine NHTSA can charge was more than doubled last year under legislation approved by Congress after Toyota Motor Corp.’s unintended acceleration recalls.But critics say it still isn’t enough to deter bad behaviour.GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch in the recalled vehicles to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power.That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags.In the fatalities, the air bags did not inflate, but the engines did not shut off in all cases, GM said.It was unclear whether the ignition switches caused the crashes, or whether people died because the air bags didn’t inflate."

                 Read Full Bio→General Motors is recalling an additional 824,000 to replace the ignition switches. That means all model years of its Chevrolet Cobalt, HHR, Pontiac G5, Solstice and Saturn Ion and Sky in the U.S. will get new switches because faulty switches may have been used to repair the vehicles.The parts are at the center of the company’s recently announced ignition switch recall, which originally extended through the 2007 model year. About 95,000 faulty switches were sold to dealers and aftermarket wholesalers. Of those, about 90,000 were used to repair older vehicles that were repaired before they were recalled in February.Because it is not feasible to track down all the parts, the company is recalling 824,000 more vehicles in the U.S. to ensure that every car has a current ignition switch. GM says it is unaware of any reports of fatalities with this group of vehicles where a frontal impact occurred, the front air bags did not deploy and the ignition is in the “accessory” or “off” position.As with the earlier recalls, if the torque performance is not to GM specification, the ignition switch may unintentionally move from the “run” position to the “accessory” or “off” positions, leading to a loss of power. The risk may be increased if the key ring is carrying added weight or if the vehicle goes off road or experiences some jarring event.The timing of the key movement out of the “run” position relative to when the sensing algorithm of a crash may result in the air bags not deploying, increasing the potential for occupant injury in certain kinds of crashes.Until the recall has been performed, GM is urging customers to remove all items -- including the key fob -- from their key rings, leaving only the vehicle key.“We are taking no chances with safety,” said GM CEO Mary Barra. “Trying to locate several thousand switches in a population of 2.2 million vehicles and distributed to thousands of retailers isn’t practical. Out of an abundance of caution, we are recalling the rest of the model years.“We are going to provide our customers with the peace of mind they deserve and expect by getting the new switches into all the vehicles,” Barra said.GM records indicate the service parts may have been used for ignition repairs in:Owners who may have had a suspect part installed will receive a letter the week of April 21. GM dealers will replace their ignition switch free of charge as parts become available.Customers who paid to have their ignition switches replaced will be eligible for reimbursement.

came close to directly blaming the ‘old’ GM,” in telling Automotive News at the Geneva Motor Show: ‘This is a new leadership team. We're aiming to do things in the
right way.""""We're doing everything we can to work with our customers and our dealers to get everything as straight as we can,"" Ammann toldAutomotive News Mike Colias and Nick
Bunkley.That includes an internal investigation for which it has
hired an outside law firm that is questioning employees, WSJ’s Bennett reports. “GM had maintained before the recall
that the cars involved were safe because they can be steered and stopped, even when the key slips out of ‘run,’ turns off the engine and eliminates power assist to the steering and brakes
and disables some safety systems,” write James R. Healey and Greg Gardner in the Detroit Free-Press. “GM also has noted that in many of the crashes
now linked to the problem that lack of seatbelt use and alcohol were factors.”In a document that in parts seems a Pythonesque parody
of  legalese — “The singular includes the plural; the plural includes the singular. The masculine includes the feminine and neuter genders; the neuter gender includes the masculine
and feminine genders” — the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued
a special order to GM with 107 specific questions it wants answered. One in particular — No. 27 — that is drawing a lot
of attention in the 27-page document is a statement by GM North America president Alan Batey in a press release Feb. 25 about the expansion of the recall. In it, he admitted, “the
chronology shows that the process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been.”The NHTSA want to know
exactly how it “was not as robust” as well “its plans (if any) to change its process.” “NHTSA also asked
GM to name all employees or engineers involved in the ignition switch production whether they worked for GM or part supplier Delphi Automotive, which made the ignition switches,” Bennett
reports.“The company is fully cooperating with NHTSA’s probe and welcomes ‘the opportunity to help the agency have a full
understanding of the facts,’ a GM spokesman, Alan Adler, said in an e-mailed statement today,” reports Bloomberg’s Jeff Plungis.Indeed, General Motors appears to be trying to appear to be as transparent as possible in is current investigation of its past investigation. In a letter to employees posted on the GM website Tuesday, CEO Barra
wrote that the inquiry “has led some to ask if the recall of these out-of-production vehicles might affect our company’s reputation or sales of our current models.” Her response is “our company’s reputation won’t be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going
forward.”Indeed, Jeremy Robinson-Leon, COO at crisis public relations firm Group Gordon, tells Healey that Barra is “staking her
reputation on handling this properly.”“Our process for determining whether and when to recall a vehicle is decided by experienced
technical experts. They do their work independent of managers with responsibilities for other aspects of the business, so that their decisions are made solely on technical facts and engineering
analysis,” Barra wrote in her email. “When this was brought to my team a few weeks ago, we acted without hesitation to go well beyond the decision by the technical
experts.”The NHTSA is facing scrutiny itself.“The safety agency has
come under mounting pressure over its own failure to act on complaints about the recalled GM cars,” Christopher Jensen reports in the New York Times. “Twice, it has
taken an in-depth look at fatal crashes, but has never begun a broader investigation.”Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) last month
“sent a letter to the agency saying that significant improvements were needed in the way it gathers information about potential defects,’ Jensen writes, but the agency replied that the
data it had did not “warrant … opening a formal investigation.”Thom Forbes was editorial director of Adweek and its sister publications in the 1980s and has written about marketing and media as a freelancer since 1990.advertisement"	Science

			Trending:		Host and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson walks across the Cosmic Calendar, on which all of time has been compressed into a year-at-a-glance, in the premiere of ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.Neil deGrasse Tyson investigates the relatedness of all living things and the possible evolution of life in the cosmos in the ""Some of the Things That Molecules Do"" episode airing March 16.Executive Producer Seth MacFarlane attends the premiere of Fox's ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" at The Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos: A Personal Journey"" was a ground-breaker for science on TV.The guy who is going to get the masses to embrace a TV series about science, the one to get viewers to go where no man has convinced them to go before – or at least since Carl Sagan – is … Seth MacFarlane?The comic mind behind “Family Guy” and the hit film “Ted” contains a serious side, too, as MacFarlane is the executive producer and driving force behind “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” – Fox’s reboot of Sagan’s 1980 miniseries masterpiece, “Cosmos: A Personal Journey” – that launched Sunday night.MacFarlane has not tackled the challenge alone. Chief among his “Cosmos” compatriots are Ann Druyan, Sagan’s widow and a co-writer of the original series, and host Neil deGrasse Tyson, the unofficial face of astrophysics to most Americans.Sagan’s “Cosmos” achieved a popularity unheard of for a science program. It became PBS’s most-watched series ever, and held that title until it was usurped in 1990 by “The Civil War.”Although the paths they take are slightly different, both versions of “Cosmos” bear an ambitious plot: The story of everything. The series is intended to be a necessarily brief biography of existence, as well as how our understanding of the known universe has evolved. The production uses special effects and animation to give the new “Cosmos” a visual impact the original could not achieve, and Tyson’s approachable style helps make a complex topic as friendly as possible.Still, the 13-part miniseries is a gamble for Fox. Science programming is extremely rare in prime time on a major network. But for MacFarlane, putting the show outside of a specialty channel was part of the appeal.“While National Geographic, Discovery Channel were some of the places that it was being considered to be pitched to and are great networks, in a way, you’re sort of preaching to the converted,” MacFarlane told a gathering of TV critics recently. “Wouldn’t it be nice to broaden it a little bit even more? And I thought that there was a strong possibility that this particular regime at Fox, as creative and open-minded as they are, would be receptive to the idea of doing the show on a network, and sure enough, they were.”And he thinks scheduling it after Fox’s block of animated comedies on Sunday nights makes sense, as it will draw viewers, well, like him.“I think you’re going to see a lot of people who are fans of both genres and are very enthusiastic,” MacFarlane said.It’s too early to tell what Sunday’s premiere means for “Cosmos.” The early numbers on Fox were unimpressive – 5.8 million viewers – but it totaled nearly 9 million when all 10 networks showing it were added in. With DVR numbers and online viewing yet to be counted, “Cosmos” still could work its way up.For many years, science television, at least for grown-ups, has largely belonged to PBS and imports from the BBC – which often are one and the same.“Nova” is a spinoff of the British series “Horizon,” and often its episodes are from that show or other documentaries from the United Kingdom, with the narration redubbed by an American speaker.The BBC has produced some of the most acclaimed science miniseries of the past: “The Blue Planet,” “Planet Earth,” “Life,” “The Ascent of Man,” many of which came to the United States via PBS.And science remains a big part of PBS’s lineup. Wednesdays were rebranded “Think Wednesday” this year, as the network added a weekly hour of science specials to its astoundingly long-lived lineup of “Nature” and “Nova.” (“Nova” debuted 40 years ago this month, on March 3, 1974.)The shows continue to be two of PBS’s better ratings draws. An episode of “Nova” about the John F. Kennedy assassination last fall pulled in nearly 6 million viewers, the biggest audience in nearly two years, according to Paula Apsell, the show’s senior executive producer. Apsell called the 2013 fall season “very successful.”Elsewhere on the programming guide, science fares less well. In the last few years, channels that served up a high portion of science have seen their schedules metamorphose into something considerably less scientific. The problem is easy to understand. For many people, “science” conjures memories of struggling to calculate molarities in high-school chemistry class. Getting them to think of science as a topic tospend their TV time on is difficult.The phenomenon mirrors what happened with channels that began in the 1990s with an eye toward arts and education. Bravo, the Arts & Entertainment Network (now A&E) and The Learning Channel (now TLC) currently serve up such highbrow fare as “The Real Housewives of Orange County” and “Here Comes Honey Boo-Boo.”Discovery, originally intended for mostly science programming, spun the bulk of its science content to a sister network, the Science Channel, to concentrate on reality series like “Deadliest Catch” and “Moonshiners.” Sure, it still offers shows like “MythBusters,” but that has been on since 2003. Newer programs aremore likely to look like “Amish Mafia.”The Science Channel itself does some excellent work, such as “Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman.” Increasingly, though, its programming slate is filled with the likes of “Uncovering Aliens” and “NASA’s Unexplained Files” that pander to pseudoscience fans and conspiracy theorists.The National Geographic Channel, the Fox sibling that is co-broadcasting “Cosmos,” has seen its schedule fill up with “Doomsday Preppers” and “Wicked Tuna.”Even legitimate science programs seem to feel the need to overemphasize death and disaster to draw viewers. For instance, History Channel’s “The Universe,” which began life as a well-reasoned documentary series, has spent the last five seasons detailing the various ways the Earth might be destroyed.But perhaps nothing exemplifies the issue better than Animal Planet, which came under fire from scientists for its 2012 “documentary” “Mermaids: The Body Found,” actually a bad science-fiction film disguised as a documentary. The special was wildly popular, and last year’s inevitable sequel, “Mermaids: The New Evidence,” became Animal Planet’s highest-rated program to date.Perhaps all is not lost, though. National Geographic’s excellent series “Brain Games,” a fun investigation into the vagaries of perception and the conscious mind, was popular enough to prompt the network to add similar programs, such as “Duck Quacks Don’t Echo.”If “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” succeeds, perhaps an explosion of science programming will follow. If not, there’s always PBS.Contact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @Watcherof TV on TwitterGet the latest news delivered daily!We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

524	"""Cosmos,"" a highly anticipated series that explores the universe and attempts to make science entertaining for everyone, is causing some to examine the tension between religion and science.The series, a revamped version of the immensely popular 1980 documentary, premiered Sunday. The series' host, Neil deGrasse Tyson, a renowned astrophysicist, told CNN's Brian Stelter he wants the series to appeal to everyone, including those ""who don't know that they like science"" and ""the people who know they don't like science at all.""The Wire contributor Danielle Wiener-Bronner believes Tyson tried to meet his goal to appeal to a wide audience in the first episode by ""inviting religious viewers to identify with scientists,"" but she also believes Tyson was attempting to persuade his religious audience to subscribe to evolution.""There was no ambiguity about the fact that Tyson wants its viewers to see the scientifically oppressed as akin to the religiously martyred,"" says Wiener-Bronner. She explains that the shows' use of the story of Giordano Bruno, a monk who was persecuted and executed for having heretical views about the universe, was similar to a Christian martyr story.Wiener-Bronner's fellow Wire contributor Abby Ohlheiser agrees with Wiener-Bronner, but she hopes religious individuals will perceive the Bruno story ""as a redrawing of the boundaries between faith and science"" rather than a condemnation of religion.""Instead of putting the two in opposition, the show wants to place faith, curiosity, wonder, and questioning — what if my God is too small? to paraphrase Bruno — along with science against enforced ignorance,"" says Ohlheiser.Other writers feel the new ""Cosmos"" is not sympathetic to religion. ""The new 'Cosmos' feels like a pushback against faith’s encroachments on the intellectual terrain of science,"" writes Matt Zoller Seitz in Vulture.And Tony Rossi wrote for Patheos that ""Cosmos"" inaccurately showed religion condemning and oppressing science, especially in the case of Bruno, who wasn’t a scientist. And, Rossi said, Bruno was outcast because of his anti-God beliefs and not his perception of the universe.“The show’s presentation of science will likely be brilliant and visually stunning, hopefully opening people’s minds to the wonder and complexity of the universe,” wrote Rossi. “But it should have stayed within the parameters of its own expertise – or at least provided an unbiased look at the whole story of what actually happened. A show and worldview that thrive on empirical evidence should have the sense and integrity to apply that approach to all aspects of its storytelling.”In an update to the post, Rossi argued that the show portrayed the Catholic Church in a negative light, but didn’t address any of the broader views on space from the church’s standpoint.“Killing people who disagree with us is indefensible, and the church was wrong to do so,” Rossi said. “Still, it’s a church with a 2,000-year history that shouldn’t just be defined by the times it was wrong.”Tyson told CNN he is frustrated by the debates about religion and science that constantly appear in op-ed articles and political campaigns.""There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,"" Tyson said. ""I find it odd that we live in a time where people who are strongly religious want to make everyone else the same kind of religious way they are, and break down the door of the science classroom to put their religious philosophies in there.""While some might think the new show is arguing against religion and faith, Slate writer Willa Paskin argued that the show is giving a uniting message about God.“Organized religion certainly comes in for it, but I think this segment is up to something more gentle than declaring war on blinkered anti-science evangelists,” Paskin wrote. “‘Cosmos’ is offering viewers a way to reconcile science and faith: Don’t let your god be too small.”Religion and space have intertwined for a while now, so much so that believers are perfectly fine with new space information that comes out, Deseret News reported in December of last year. Faithful religious followers see the universe’s chaos as an example that God exists.“It’s so perfect,” said Jennifer LeClaire, an editor and writer at the Christian magazine Charisma, to Deseret News. It’s so ordered so perfectly. What’s to keep it from melting and coming down? God.”"	Science
525	"Was ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" a red giant in the TV ratings or more of a white dwarf?Well, that depends on whom you ask.The science-minded people at Fox predict that Sunday's premiere of ""Family Guy"" producer Seth MacFarlane's reboot of the classic Carl Sagan docu-series — this time hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson — will be seen by more than 40 million total viewers this week, according to Nielsen numbers. How did the network arrive at that figure? Nielsen estimates that a total of 8.5 million watched Sunday on a total of 10 Fox-owned networks, including Fox broadcast, National Geographic and FX. Throw in foreign territories and time-delayed viewing via DVR, and supposedly you'll quintuple that figure by week's end.BEST TV OF 2013 Lloyd | McNamaraThat sounds a bit blinded by science, though. ""Cosmos"" failed to throw off much light on Fox Sunday, gathering fewer than 6 million total viewers despite heavy promotion. It was trounced by ABC's premiere of ""Resurrection,"" a life-after-death drama that animated more than 13 million.Fox points out that ""Cosmos"" aired against some heavy competition, which besides ""Resurrection"" included AMC's zombie smash ""The Walking Dead"" (12.7 million) and HBO's season finale of the critically acclaimed crime drama ""True Detective"" (3.5 million).Which is all true enough, but then again there are people who do TV scheduling for a living and Fox knew what the whiteboard looked like when ""Cosmos"" was put there.

526	"Posted by 	Ian Casselberry
	 on Mar 10, 2014 14:15Early on during Fox’s new version of Cosmos, host Neil deGrasse Tyson shares what is likely a guiding principle for his life and work, but certainly a fundamental premise of this new show: “Science gives us the power to see what our senses cannot.”What our senses can’t see without science — and some extremely impressive animation and effects work by the show’s producers — is the universe around us. Tyson and his “Ship of the Imagination” (a sleek update of Carl Sagan’s original concept that would fit comfortably in any current sci-fi film) takes us on a guided tour of the solar system, of the galaxy, pushing the view further and further out until we reach the limit of our knowledge and perception. There’s only so much we know. There may be only so much we ever know.For many, that could be a stopping point. How interested can we be, or should we be, in something so abstract, something we can’t see or perhaps even comprehend? In Tyson’s view, however, that uncertainty should be what fuels our desire to learn more. It’s there — we just haven’t seen it yet. And that should excite us. Why wouldn’t it excite us? How could you not want to learn more about this? Come on and join him on his magic spaceship ride!Above all, the intent of Cosmos seems to be getting you to look up from your laptop, put down your phone, stop playing games and chatting, realize what the hell is going on around you (in a cosmic sense) and appreciate just how amazing everything is. A byproduct of that is telling us to get over ourselves. We are but a tiny speck of dust on the table that is the universe. Existence as we know it — or what we know of it — is so very small in the big, infinite picture.But Tyson and Cosmos try to make that concept accessible by framing it in terms we can understand. In perhaps the best segment of the first episode, Tyson lays out the existence of the universe as if it were a 12-month calendar. The Big Bang, of course, would be Jan. 1 on this calendar, while humanity would be Dec. 31 — not just the last day, but the very last seconds of this cosmic year. If this calendar was on your desk, we would be the extremely tiny tip of the lower-left corner.This is one of several moments in Cosmos’ first episode meant to make you go, “Whoa…!” And you can sense Tyson in front of you, smiling and saying, I know — right?” The astrophysicist is the perfect host for the show, having been an ambassador and champion of science in the culture for years. He’s obviously comfortable talking to fellow academics, but also makes a great guest on shows like The Daily Show, The Colbert Report and Real Time with Bill Maher because he’s intelligent, funny and entertainingly intolerant of those who willfully ignore the facts that science presents.Most importantly, Tyson is engaging enough that you want to listen to him. (So many already have, from Tyson’s days of hosting Nova on PBS to his StarTalk podcast.) The man is a really good talker and an enthusiastic teacher. And he’s great on Twitter.(Two years ago, Tyson was even a character in a Superman comic, showing the Man of Steel his home world of Krypton. Because who else would you want to consult with Superman about his home planet and how he traveled to Earth than Neil deGrasse Tyson?)But there’s also something personal in this for Tyson, as he shares toward the end of the first episode. Sagan was a hero of his, a mentor. As a 17-year-old from the Bronx, Tyson traveled to Cornell to visit Sagan and spend the day with him. Sagan welcomed him with open arms, signed his books, offered him lodging and inspired the young man to follow his interests and curiosities. Hosting Cosmos is a legacy for Tyson, one he’s clearly honored to fulfill as tribute to a man who meant so much to him.The show looks fantastic. As mentioned earlier, the cosmic landscapes created by animation and visual effects are as impressive as anything you’d see in a Hollywood blockbuster. This show isn’t restricted by the public television budget that Sagan’s original PBS incarnation of Cosmos had to work with. (And, of course, computer-generated imagery has come a long, long way in more than 30 years.) The producers have invested some serious money into this project and it’s impressively apparent on screen.One of my first thoughts as I was watching the show was that my TV isn’t nearly big enough. I was watching on the smaller screen in my bedroom. This is one you’ll want to watch on the big screen in your living room. The show seems to be why HD televisions were invented. Retailers like Best Buy will want to play episodes of Cosmos on the sales floor to show customers what their televisions are capable of showing. It’s not just hockey and golf that looks great on those sets, folks.Watching Cosmos on the big screen in your living room raises another thought. If this is meant to be Sunday night family-friendly programming — and it’s easy to imagine parents watching this with their children, with everyone in awe and learning — why isn’t Fox showing this at 7 p.m., instead of 9 p.m. when many kids are presumably going to bed? (Even worse is the Monday night replay on National Geographic Channel, which broadcasts at 10 p.m.) Or did the kids already get their fill of programming with Fox’s animation block?Speaking of that animation block, one of the biggest surprises behind the scenes of Cosmos, if you didn’t already know, is that Family Guy impresario Seth McFarlane is a key figure responsible for the show’s revival. “Cosmos Being Brought Back by Seth McFarlane” seems more like an Onion headline than actual news.The guy who’s created some of TV’s raunchiest (and funniest) prime-time content is shepherding Carl Sagan’s original science vehicle? Yet we should all be grateful that McFarlane has enough influence and clout with Fox to get this series made. It surely wasn’t an easy sell for prime-time programming. Any worries that Peter Griffin will tell us about Uranus are unfounded. Besides, would Tyson really let that happen? He’s more concerned with battling the war on science, as CNN’s Brian Stelter calls it, or what President Obama termed “the flat earth society.” Educating the masses, fighting for science’s place in the culture and respecting our role in the universe is far more important work.If you missed Cosmos Sunday night, try to catch that replay on NatGeo or check it out on Hulu. The stuff with the spaceship might seem a bit cheesy, but it’s all fun. (That is, unless you feel the show might be challenging your religious or anti-science beliefs. It’s not for everyone, nor is it intended to be.) Cosmos will make you feel like a kid again. Or maybe take you back to those dorm-room discussions (perhaps drug- or alcohol-fueled, perhaps not) when you contemplated existence, the origins of trees and the vastness of outer space. It restores a sense of wonder, which is what great television should do.

527	"Last night’s season finale of True Detective temporarily crashed HBO Go, and the premiere of Cosmos – the updated version of Carl Sagan’s hit series, with new host Neil deGrasse Tyson – drew 5.8 million total viewers to 
 
Fox
 when it aired after its very strange bedfellow Family Guy (Seth MacFarlane is an exec producer). Cosmos’ ratings weren’t as stellar as some had hoped, but True Detective proved to be HBO’s most popular new series since Six Feet Under.Ratings aside, people were Tweeting about both shows last night, and though they couldn’t catch up to The Walking Dead and Pretty Little Liars (perennial favorites on Nielsen SocialGuide’s weekly list, likely thanks to the rabid fan base of tweens) True Detective inspired 97,000 Tweets, while Cosmos had 167,000 people sharing their observations about the show, which had an intro by President Obama.It’s sad to say goodbye to Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as world-weary detectives Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, but it’s the kind of show that will no doubt inspire people to immediately watch the show a second time to find early clues about the mysterious “yellow king,” the spaghetti-faced monster, and all those pagan spirals. As for Cosmos, we’ll see how the show fares going forward. For more on Nielsen SocialGuide’s Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings Weekly Top Ten click here.

528	"Cosmos host Neil DeGrasse Tyson is a scientist, not a devout atheist, and he has no problem with people subscribing to whatever religion they believe in. But as an educator, he has a big problem when religious activists attempt to insert their beliefs into science education as if it’s an equally valid theory. He said, “The issue there is not religion versus non-religion or religion versus science, the issue there is ideas that are different versus dogma.”Brian Lehrer asked Tyson in the radio interview if religion and science are compatible. Tyson said there are plenty of scientists who believe in God, and in that sense they are, but not if religion starts meddling in science.“If you start using your scripture, your religious text as a source of your science, that’s where you run into problems, and there is no example of someone reading their scripture and saying ‘I have a prediction about the world that no one knows yet because this gave me insight.'”He added, “Enlightened religious people know this, and don’t try to use the Bible as a textbook.”Tyson was on CNN yesterday saying that anti-science views just aren’t worth giving equal time on cable news.Listen to the audio below, via The Brian Lehrer Show:[h/t Salon]

CosmosRecaps & Reviews

Mar 10, 2014
Matt Tucker 
It’s been ages since I’ve seen the original PBS version of Cosmos (heretofore to be distinguished by the latter part of its full title, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, when applicable), and I’m less familiar with it than I’d remembered while encountering the first episode of FOX’s fancy new Cosmos (consequently heretofore to be referred to by the latter part of its official title Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, also when applicable). In a fashion, that’s a good thing, as it provided the opportunity for a fresh approach to the new presentation. Eventually revisiting the prior work would be welcome to see how well they both convey what is ultimately similar material.A Spacetime Odyssey is an intriguing proposition. With FOX’s immense resources, they’ve spared no expense at bringing this engaging introduction and exploration into the science of life amongst the universe to, well, life. It’s clear that such an update is entirely relevant when trying to reach an audience that has continually been wowed to expectation by the Hollywood machine. At the same time, it will be interesting to see if audiences, particularly young demographics, respond and turn out to take advantage of this unique use of primetime airspace.One of the more surprising facets of this production is that Seth MacFarlane — he of Family Guy fame — is the driving force behind it. He not only invested his own money in the project but was influential in getting FOX on-board and providing the bulk of the funding. MacFarlane was concerned that less focus on space travel and exploration in modern times was a result of what he called “our culture of lethargy,” and that thought behind this project is to once again spark the imagination and interest in what’s out there for newer generations.MacFarlane became friends with writer Ann Druyan, wife of the late Carl Sagan, the brain behind A Personal Voyage, and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, a mentee and devotee of Sagan’s. They’ve tried for years to launch an update and follow-on to Sagan’s seminal series, and make no mistake, the two are the scientific, creative, and educational hearts and minds behind the revival. Their care and devotion to Sagan’s work and science in general is evident in every moment of the first hour of this thirteen-part series event. Tyson, who has gained his own popular following and serves as both the face and the voice of A Spacetime Odyssey, recounted how he was introduced to Sagan at 17 years old, solidifying his desires to pursue science as a career, but also modeling how open and communicative of a person to be, particularly in gifting the knowledge of science to those who haven’t devoted their lives to it.Tyson proves a warm and enchanting host, never too wild as to be shrill and push people away, but also not dispassionate or cold as to bore or isolate the audience. He fundamentally understands that as academic as the material needs to be, it also has to be entertaining. Using the kitschy yet cool framing device of being on a ship that allows him to traverse the vast expanse of the observed universe, as well as gives him the ability to view through the extensive reach of time both backwards through the past and into the future, Tyson is able to engage new generations in the best possible way. It’s a visual shorthand that offers the appropriate lens through which to keep them interested. (Yes, by all means, it should be noted that this “Spaceship of the Imagination” is firmly rooted in the original series, which used the same device to attract and interact with its audience.)The question is will it keep new audiences interested. And, for as media-focused as our young have become, is network television the best outlet? It’s certainly more prominent than public television would offer in this day and age, even with all the focus on shows as wildly popular as Downton Abbey, Doctor Who, and Sherlock. (Though, to be fair, one has to wonder if most are catching those shows on BBC America instead of PBS.) In a generation starting to get used to getting bite-sized educational information, specifically through new media, are we at the point where a television miniseries event is going to provide the same impact as the original? Certainly, involving a second screen app on mobile devices to delve further into the information presented in each episode is a shrewd model and practice. And, if anything, this is the type of series that will likely be made available for use in classrooms to tie into specific lesson plans, perhaps allowing for even greater modern ways to communicate the included information.These are fascinating questions raised by the creation and airing of this series. Educational television is hardly anything new — in fact, FOX is re-airing episodes on its distinctly appropriate National Geographic Channel — but employing mainstream educational programming portends good things for the future, especially if this does well in the ratings. It’s also exciting to see network television branch out and try new models and new approaches to their programming. For that alone, this endeavor should be celebrated.Beyond all of those externalities, this first episode draws one in throughout the hour. It starts right from the beginning with the Big Bang, describing in brisk, fantastic detail how our Sun, the Earth, and our moon came to be formed. Tyson presents us with Sagan’s “Cosmic Calendar,” which uses the familiar construct of our annual calendar to present the known entirety of cosmic time in a digestible and relatable context. It still proves a powerful metaphor. To see the extent of our human history relegated to mere “seconds” of the “cosmic year” is both humbling and awing.Further captivating was the zooming out through the various layers of the universe to really identify just where we are in the cosmic soup. For better or for worse, it reminded me of the navigation system of the Mass Effect video game series, which was obviously trying to ape true cosmology as much as possible, and was always a personal favorite element of those games. It wasn’t surprising to see the scope, but it said much for the presentation that it kept the viewer engrossed as the Spaceship flew further out. A few notable moments: The still-saddening recognition of Pluto as just one of many planetoid structures laying amidst and beyond the belt past Neptune. (Tyson is popularly cited with starting the movement to “demote” Pluto from planetary status, which the IAU agreed with in 2006.) And the recognition of the theory of multiple universes.With the series being fundamentally science-based, it’s not hard to see how those of religious faith and belief could possibly be turned off to the material. Yet, Tyson and Druyan don’t necessarily shy away from religions of the world and the obvious connection to the creation of life. In some instances, including an extended animated sequence recounting the story of Giordano Bruno, they touch on the role religious institutions played in science, but more specifically the availability of education, during the early formation of what’s come to be known as Copernican cosmology.It is unfortunate yet historical that churches have, at various times and for myriad reasons, withheld education and writing from the masses. In the case of Bruno, who actually wasn’t a scientist and based his beliefs of an ever-expanding universe made of multiple stars and solar systems on visions and the reading of certain books considered apocryphal, he was tossed out of the church and eventually burned for daring to espouse his beliefs. Sadly, Galileo would prove him right just a scant decade after his death. Some might consider this science trying to blackeye religion, yet it’s honestly addressed historically rather than with any sort of bias.Furthermore, they manage to namecheck Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha without scientific comment during the discussion of our human history. One wouldn’t expect Tyson to start quoting scripture throughout this series, but they aren’t attempting to get into the ages-old science vs. faith debate.Behind the deft writing of Druyan and Steven Soter and the adept direction of Brannon Braga, he of Star Trek franchise fame, this first episode is a wondrous jaunt through the basics of our universe. Some may describe it as nothing more than a glorified planetarium exhibit, and yet there is really very little wrong with that. Through state-of-the-art visuals and a compelling score by heavyweight composer Alan Silvestri, it’s a sweeping and sense-engaging installment that instills the appropriate excitement for the entire endeavor.It’s safe to say that, while I was intrigued by the premise; fondly recalled the excitement, if not the particulars, of the original series; and was impressed by the gumption to do this series event in regular season primetime network television, I hadn’t expected to be as nigh-inspired by the hour as I was. Science has always been an interest, particularly the cosmos, but never to the level that fired a dedicated pursuit into the field. That makes programs like A Spacetime Odyssey a treasure and astonishing journey to spark those latent passions, if only for those moments.Yet, that spark was greater than anticipated, inspiring in personal pursuits beyond those secondary or tertiary interests. That speaks to the power of the series, and a desire to see more of it. I’m left wondering how many others were so inspired.Matt Tucker is a stage and film actor, writer, Seattleite, comics nerd, sports fan, and aspiring person. Someday, he’ll be a real boy.

FYI

Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, hosted by Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, began its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.

 
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Astronomer Carl Sagan become Mr. Science for a generation after his 1980 series, Cosmos, took audiences on a groundbreaking TV journey through the universe.



Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, the 21st-century edition, which debuted Sunday on Fox, has a head start with a Twitter following of 1.7 million thats just edged by the starry likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Cee Lo Green. 



Tyson, a go-to expert for news reports on Earth-threatening asteroids and other science developments, said his public profile frees him from comparisons to Sagan. The educator and author with a gift for conveying the wonder of discovery died in 1996 at age 62.



If I didnt have a following, I think people would say, How is he going to fill Carl Sagans shoes? How is he going to pronounce billion? said Tyson, referring to the billions and billions of stars phrase made famous by Sagan in Cosmos (although purists insist Sagan said upon, not and).

Sagan was the presenter for the first series, Tyson said, and hes the presenter for the second. He gamely accepts an analogy, one hes clearly heard before, to the string of actors who have starred in the Doctor Who title role.



Each contributes something different, but youre still with the franchise at the end of the day, he said.



The new version began its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.



Tyson, 55, brings to the program his distinguished credentials as director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an author whose works include Space Chronicles and The Pluto Files.



Hes the perfect modern media scientist: tall and good-looking, with a deep voice that he uses to charismatic and authoritative effect.



Proving hes a stickler for accuracy, Tyson took Gravity to task for scientific gaffes and prompted a flurry of coverage ranging from Hollywood trade papers to geek-favored websites. Among the more lighthearted of his Mysteries of #Gravity tweets: Why Bullocks hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.



He is also one of the nations most prominent African-American scientists, but says ethnicity isnt in the forefront of his perspective.



Ive never divided my audience that way. My audience is, are you curious about the universe or not? Tyson said. The father of two also rejects the idea of inspiring anyone to follow his career path because he is black.



I dont go around saying Im going to be somebodys role model. In fact, I think the concept of role model is overrated and should be rethought, he said. His argument: If it had taken a black astrophysicist to have been raised in Bronx, N.Y., as Tyson was, for him to become one, it wouldnt have happened.



Role models limit what it is you might want to be when you grow up, because youre only allowed to do what others have done who have come before you, Tyson said. And no one should ever be limited in their imagination.



His involvement in Cosmos brings him to a different and bigger stage. It gives him the chance to increase his profile with a new crowd, including the viewers who tune in to Fox for Family Guy laughs in the half-hour preceding Cosmos on Sunday and suddenly find themselves lost in space. 



It was Seth MacFarlane, the comic mind behind Family Guy and other projects including Foxs American Dad! and the movie Ted, who got the network involved in the project. MacFarlane, a fan of the original Cosmos, also turns out to be a Tyson admirer. The two met through a group that connects people in science and entertainment for the exchange of ideas.



MacFarlane told reporters in January that he wanted to sit down and ask him (Tyson) a whole bunch of nerd questions, and so I asked if he wanted to have lunch, and astonishingly he said yes.



They became collaborators on Cosmos, with MacFarlane an executive producer. The project has the look of a costly sci-fi film, reflecting what Tyson called a budget commensurate with its scope as well as the participation of top entertainment industry talent such as Bill Pope, director of photography on Matrix and Spider-Man movies.



Patrick Stewart, Richard Gere, Kirsten Dunst and other actors give voice to the scientists whose achievements are part of Cosmos.



Adding to its pedigree: Sagans widow, Ann Druyan, who wrote the original series with Sagan and Steven Soter and who joined again with Soter to craft the second.



Shes also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.



Yes, its the same in that intersection of emotion and solid science and fabulous facts and animation and drama and history, she told a news conference. But its completely new.



For Tyson, the series is a means to connect viewers to the awe and wonder of the universe and the role of science in helping them become a better shepherd of this world.



We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address, he said.

It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.LOS ANGELES (AP)  Astronomer Carl Sagan become Mr. Science for a generation after his 1980 series, Cosmos, took audiences on a groundbreaking TV journey through the universe.


Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, the 21st-century edition, which debuted Sunday on Fox, has a head start with a Twitter following of 1.7 million thats just edged by the starry likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Cee Lo Green. 



Tyson, a go-to expert for news reports on Earth-threatening asteroids and other science developments, said his public profile frees him from comparisons to Sagan. The educator and author with a gift for conveying the wonder of discovery died in 1996 at age 62.



If I didnt have a following, I think people would say, How is he going to fill Carl Sagans shoes? How is he going to pronounce billion? said Tyson, referring to the billions and billions of stars phrase made famous by Sagan in Cosmos (although purists insist Sagan said upon, not and).

Sagan was the presenter for the first series, Tyson said, and hes the presenter for the second. He gamely accepts an analogy, one hes clearly heard before, to the string of actors who have starred in the Doctor Who title role.

For Tyson, the series is a means to connect viewers to the awe and wonder of the universe and the role of science in helping them become a better shepherd of this world.



We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address, he said.

Tyson, a go-to expert for news reports on Earth-threatening asteroids and other science developments, said his public profile frees him from comparisons to Sagan. The educator and author with a gift for conveying the wonder of discovery died in 1996 at age 62.


If I didnt have a following, I think people would say, How is he going to fill Carl Sagans shoes? How is he going to pronounce billion? said Tyson, referring to the billions and billions of stars phrase made famous by Sagan in Cosmos (although purists insist Sagan said upon, not and).

Sagan was the presenter for the first series, Tyson said, and hes the presenter for the second. He gamely accepts an analogy, one hes clearly heard before, to the string of actors who have starred in the Doctor Who title role.



Each contributes something different, but youre still with the franchise at the end of the day, he said.



The new version began its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.



Tyson, 55, brings to the program his distinguished credentials as director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an author whose works include Space Chronicles and The Pluto Files.



Hes the perfect modern media scientist: tall and good-looking, with a deep voice that he uses to charismatic and authoritative effect.



Proving hes a stickler for accuracy, Tyson took Gravity to task for scientific gaffes and prompted a flurry of coverage ranging from Hollywood trade papers to geek-favored websites. Among the more lighthearted of his Mysteries of #Gravity tweets: Why Bullocks hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.



He is also one of the nations most prominent African-American scientists, but says ethnicity isnt in the forefront of his perspective.



Ive never divided my audience that way. My audience is, are you curious about the universe or not? Tyson said. The father of two also rejects the idea of inspiring anyone to follow his career path because he is black.



I dont go around saying Im going to be somebodys role model. In fact, I think the concept of role model is overrated and should be rethought, he said. His argument: If it had taken a black astrophysicist to have been raised in Bronx, N.Y., as Tyson was, for him to become one, it wouldnt have happened.



Role models limit what it is you might want to be when you grow up, because youre only allowed to do what others have done who have come before you, Tyson said. And no one should ever be limited in their imagination.



His involvement in Cosmos brings him to a different and bigger stage. It gives him the chance to increase his profile with a new crowd, including the viewers who tune in to Fox for Family Guy laughs in the half-hour preceding Cosmos on Sunday and suddenly find themselves lost in space. 



It was Seth MacFarlane, the comic mind behind Family Guy and other projects including Foxs American Dad! and the movie Ted, who got the network involved in the project. MacFarlane, a fan of the original Cosmos, also turns out to be a Tyson admirer. The two met through a group that connects people in science and entertainment for the exchange of ideas.



MacFarlane told reporters in January that he wanted to sit down and ask him (Tyson) a whole bunch of nerd questions, and so I asked if he wanted to have lunch, and astonishingly he said yes.



They became collaborators on Cosmos, with MacFarlane an executive producer. The project has the look of a costly sci-fi film, reflecting what Tyson called a budget commensurate with its scope as well as the participation of top entertainment industry talent such as Bill Pope, director of photography on Matrix and Spider-Man movies.



Patrick Stewart, Richard Gere, Kirsten Dunst and other actors give voice to the scientists whose achievements are part of Cosmos.



Adding to its pedigree: Sagans widow, Ann Druyan, who wrote the original series with Sagan and Steven Soter and who joined again with Soter to craft the second.



Shes also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.

Each contributes something different, but youre still with the franchise at the end of the day, he said.


The new version began its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.



Tyson, 55, brings to the program his distinguished credentials as director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an author whose works include Space Chronicles and The Pluto Files.



Hes the perfect modern media scientist: tall and good-looking, with a deep voice that he uses to charismatic and authoritative effect.



Proving hes a stickler for accuracy, Tyson took Gravity to task for scientific gaffes and prompted a flurry of coverage ranging from Hollywood trade papers to geek-favored websites. Among the more lighthearted of his Mysteries of #Gravity tweets: Why Bullocks hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.



He is also one of the nations most prominent African-American scientists, but says ethnicity isnt in the forefront of his perspective.



Ive never divided my audience that way. My audience is, are you curious about the universe or not? Tyson said. The father of two also rejects the idea of inspiring anyone to follow his career path because he is black.



I dont go around saying Im going to be somebodys role model. In fact, I think the concept of role model is overrated and should be rethought, he said. His argument: If it had taken a black astrophysicist to have been raised in Bronx, N.Y., as Tyson was, for him to become one, it wouldnt have happened.



Role models limit what it is you might want to be when you grow up, because youre only allowed to do what others have done who have come before you, Tyson said. And no one should ever be limited in their imagination.



His involvement in Cosmos brings him to a different and bigger stage. It gives him the chance to increase his profile with a new crowd, including the viewers who tune in to Fox for Family Guy laughs in the half-hour preceding Cosmos on Sunday and suddenly find themselves lost in space. 



It was Seth MacFarlane, the comic mind behind Family Guy and other projects including Foxs American Dad! and the movie Ted, who got the network involved in the project. MacFarlane, a fan of the original Cosmos, also turns out to be a Tyson admirer. The two met through a group that connects people in science and entertainment for the exchange of ideas.



MacFarlane told reporters in January that he wanted to sit down and ask him (Tyson) a whole bunch of nerd questions, and so I asked if he wanted to have lunch, and astonishingly he said yes.



They became collaborators on Cosmos, with MacFarlane an executive producer. The project has the look of a costly sci-fi film, reflecting what Tyson called a budget commensurate with its scope as well as the participation of top entertainment industry talent such as Bill Pope, director of photography on Matrix and Spider-Man movies.



Patrick Stewart, Richard Gere, Kirsten Dunst and other actors give voice to the scientists whose achievements are part of Cosmos.



Adding to its pedigree: Sagans widow, Ann Druyan, who wrote the original series with Sagan and Steven Soter and who joined again with Soter to craft the second.



Shes also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.



Yes, its the same in that intersection of emotion and solid science and fabulous facts and animation and drama and history, she told a news conference. But its completely new.



For Tyson, the series is a means to connect viewers to the awe and wonder of the universe and the role of science in helping them become a better shepherd of this world.



We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address, he said.

We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address, he said.

Proving hes a stickler for accuracy, Tyson took Gravity to task for scientific gaffes and prompted a flurry of coverage ranging from Hollywood trade papers to geek-favored websites. Among the more lighthearted of his Mysteries of #Gravity tweets: Why Bullocks hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.


He is also one of the nations most prominent African-American scientists, but says ethnicity isnt in the forefront of his perspective.



Ive never divided my audience that way. My audience is, are you curious about the universe or not? Tyson said. The father of two also rejects the idea of inspiring anyone to follow his career path because he is black.



I dont go around saying Im going to be somebodys role model. In fact, I think the concept of role model is overrated and should be rethought, he said. His argument: If it had taken a black astrophysicist to have been raised in Bronx, N.Y., as Tyson was, for him to become one, it wouldnt have happened.



Role models limit what it is you might want to be when you grow up, because youre only allowed to do what others have done who have come before you, Tyson said. And no one should ever be limited in their imagination.



His involvement in Cosmos brings him to a different and bigger stage. It gives him the chance to increase his profile with a new crowd, including the viewers who tune in to Fox for Family Guy laughs in the half-hour preceding Cosmos on Sunday and suddenly find themselves lost in space. 



It was Seth MacFarlane, the comic mind behind Family Guy and other projects including Foxs American Dad! and the movie Ted, who got the network involved in the project. MacFarlane, a fan of the original Cosmos, also turns out to be a Tyson admirer. The two met through a group that connects people in science and entertainment for the exchange of ideas.



MacFarlane told reporters in January that he wanted to sit down and ask him (Tyson) a whole bunch of nerd questions, and so I asked if he wanted to have lunch, and astonishingly he said yes.



They became collaborators on Cosmos, with MacFarlane an executive producer. The project has the look of a costly sci-fi film, reflecting what Tyson called a budget commensurate with its scope as well as the participation of top entertainment industry talent such as Bill Pope, director of photography on Matrix and Spider-Man movies.



Patrick Stewart, Richard Gere, Kirsten Dunst and other actors give voice to the scientists whose achievements are part of Cosmos.



Adding to its pedigree: Sagans widow, Ann Druyan, who wrote the original series with Sagan and Steven Soter and who joined again with Soter to craft the second.



Shes also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.

Shes also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.



Yes, its the same in that intersection of emotion and solid science and fabulous facts and animation and drama and history, she told a news conference. But its completely new.



For Tyson, the series is a means to connect viewers to the awe and wonder of the universe and the role of science in helping them become a better shepherd of this world.



We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address, he said.

534	"Neil deGrasse Tyson had some straightforward words about using the Bible as a scientific source. Specifically in terms of the Earth being created before the sun, as in Genesis, Tyson said, ""None of that is consistent with any scientifically derived information about the world."" He continued, ""So enlightened religious people know this, and don't try to use the Bible as a textbook, using a Western example.""Tyson made the comments during an interview this morning on WNYC's ""Brian Lehrer Show."" In a segment called ""Ask and Astrophysicist,"" the man who rebooted Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" answered questions from Lehrer and New York City residents about everything under (and beyond) the sun.Intermingled between discussions of ""Cosmos,"" which premiered last night, and quantum physics, Lehrer asked Tyson about religion versus science:""So the first episode of ""Cosmos"" told the story, among other things, of a 16th century Italian monk Giordano Bruno who publicly thought, or said that he thought the universe was infinite. And he was dismissed and eventually excommunicated and killed by the Catholic Church. Did you bring that into the show because you see any scary parallels between science and religion today?""Tyson responded with an initial guffaw, and responded that two others wrote the show. But on the subject of Giordano Bruno, Tyson said, ""His god, as he conceived it, was bigger than the god expressed literally in scripture or as interpreted by the cardinals of the [Catholic] Church of the day.""""The issue there is not religion versus non-religion, or religion versus science,"" Tyson said. ""The issue is ideas that are different versus dogma."" (All categories of dogma from religious to political.)Lehrer then wondered if ideas and dogma are compatible today. Neil deGrasse Tyson said that around one-third of ""Western/American scientists claim that there is a god to whom they pray"" and they're ""fully functioning"" scientists. Tyson points out that the problem is using your scripture as a scientific source. As the astrophysicist put it:""There is no example of someone reading their scripture and saying, 'I have a prediction about the world that no one knows yet, because this gave me insight. Let's go test that prediction,' and have the prediction be correct.""He also stated that there is an issue of teaching scripture-based science in schools and said there's no history of scientists or ""even atheists"" harping on Sunday schools to have them teach scientific views. The entire interview is worth listening to especially if you, like Neil deGrasse Tyson, believe that ""everyone should have their mind blown once a day.""Copyright © 2018 Salon Media Group, Inc.

535	"'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey' reboots Carl Sagan's popular science miniseries. Here are seven things that the show's new host, Neil deGrasse Tyson, taught us about the universe and our place in it. ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" premiered Sunday night (March 9), rebooting the series that the late astronomer Carl Sagan turned into a TV classic 34 years ago.Against a backdrop of sleek graphics and astronomical imagery, host Neil deGrasse Tyson brought a new generation of viewers up to speed about our place in the cosmos. In the hour-long premiere, Tyson broke down each line in our cosmic address, from Earth to the farthest reaches of the observable universe, and he time-traveled through the cosmic calendar from the Big Bang to the present.Some of these morsels may be old news for veteran ""Cosmos"" fans and space buffs, but here's seven awesome things we learned in the series premiere:1. Jupiter has hurricane three times the size of EarthStarting with Sagan, ""Cosmos"" has a long tradition of throwing Earth into scale. The first episode of the new series showed that even within our own solar system our home planet looks relatively small — especially compared to Jupiter.""With its four giant moons and dozens of smaller moons, Jupiter is like its own little solar system,"" Tyson said. ""It has more mass than all of the other planets combined.""Tyson then pointed out the gas planet's Great Red Spot, a hurricane three times the size of Earth that's been plaguing Jupiter for centuries.2. Our solar system has a huge shell that no one can seeOur solar system is enclosed by a swarm of icy bodies known as the Oort cloud, but as a whole, this shell is imperceptible to humans. That's because these comets — leftovers from the solar system's formation — are separated from each other by hundreds of millions of miles.""Each one of these little worlds is as far from it's nearest neighbor as Earth is from Saturn,"" Tyson said.3. Our universe may be part of a multiverseThe ""observable universe,"" is listed as the last line in our cosmic address (Earth is first) in the inaugural episode of the new ""Cosmos."" But as Tyson says, this may only be our cosmic horizon.""Many of us suspect that all of this — all the worlds, stars, galaxies and clusters in our observable universe — is but one tiny bubble in an infinite ocean of other universes,"" Tyson said. In other words, we could be living in a multiverse.4. Our cosmic perspective is relatively newCosmically speaking, it wasn't so long ago that humans thought Earth was the center of the universe. (Actually you can still find humans who believe this; a recent survey found that 1 in 4 Americans thinks the sun revolves around Earth.)""Cosmos"" illustrates just how dangerous it was to challenge cosmic mores a mere 400 years ago through the tale of Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by executive producer Seth MacFarlane). Bruno suggested that we live in a boundless universe, orbiting one of many stars. His reward? Imprisonment and a fiery death at the stake.5. In the cosmic calendar, Jesus was born just 5 seconds agoThose who watched Sagan's original series will remember the cosmic calendar, which is a way to conceptualize the age of the universe (13.8 billion years). Tyson revived the tool, explaining that Jan. 1 would mark the Big Bang and the present falls on midnight on Dec. 31. At this scale, every day represents nearly 40 million years and humans only evolved in the last hour of New Year's Eve.6. Carl Sagan and new ""Cosmos"" host Neil deGrasse Tyson go way backOne poignant moment in the ""Cosmos"" premiere occurred at the end, where host Neil deGrasse Tyson touched on Sagan's legacy in astronomy and science communication. Tyson showed a day calendar from 1975 - Sagan's own daily planner - with a meeting with Tyson penned in on a Saturday. Sagan had invited the then 17-year-old Tyson to Ithaca, N.Y., where Sagan taught at Cornell University, for a visit. It was snowing when the young Tyson went to catch the bus back home to the Bronx. Sagan gave Tyson his home phone number, and invited the student to call him if the bus didn't show and spend the weekend with his family. """"I already knew I wanted to become a scientist, but that afternoon I learned what kind of person I wanted to be,"" Tyson said in the premiere.7. We are made of star stuffLong-time ""Cosmos"" fans were waiting for this moment and Tyson delivered.He explained that the stuff of life and the elements familiar to us on Earth today were cooked inside the hearts of collapsing stars billions of years ago.""They get so hot that the nuclei of the atoms fuse together deep within them to make the oxygen with breathe, the carbon in our muscles, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our blood,"" Tyson said. ""You, me, everyone: We are made of star stuff.""The premiere of ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey will re-air tonight at 10 p.m. ET/PT on the National Geographic Channel and include some extra material on the making of the show.

536	"03.10.2014LifeShare this PostFor the fans of Carl Sagan's  Cosmos series, you might just be pleasantly surprised that the series is back with a 'big bang', not to mention updates on all of the new discoveries in the universe. As if the debut on Sunday night wasn't exciting enough, there was a pretty special surprise guest: President Barack Obama, who introduced the episode with a special message that urged viewers to explore new frontiers, like space! All politics aside, it was awe inspiring to have Obama as the opening act of such a spectacular event. The president's introduction “invites a new generation to embrace the spirit of discovery and inspires viewers to explore new frontiers and imagine limitless possibilities for the future,” according to a statement issued by Fox.The new Fox science series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey  premiered on Sunday March 9th, and begins a 13-part journey through the universe and beyond, airing on 10 networks, led by Fox and National Geographic Channel.With the brilliant scientist, astrophysicist and educator, Neil deGrasse Tyson hosting the series, it should be full of surprises.I want to fall to my knees and weep tears of joy for how beautiful and mind blowing #Cosmos is done. Bravo @neiltyson bravo. #CosmosPremiere— Melissa Danielson⚡️ (@DaniMeli208) March 10, 2014Robert Lloyd writes in his review for The Times, headlined: Neil deGrasse Tyson's 'Cosmos' a fascinating, fun place to be: “The subject — everything that is and how it got that way — is obviously a big one, encompassing not only planets and stars and amoebas and people, but the lenses through which we've viewed it all. Most important, it celebrates scientific inquiry itself, which Tyson defines as 'generations of searchers strictly adhering to a simple set of rules: test ideas by experiment and observation; build on those ideas that pass the test; reject the ones that fail; follow the evidence wherever it leads; and question everything.""The series is presented to generate interest in science and the universe, with an interesting and fun introduction. ""The goal is to convey why science matters to the person, to our society, to us as shepherds of this planet. It involves presenting science in ways that connect to you, so Cosmos can influence you not only intellectually but emotionally, with a celebration of wonder and awe,"" says Tyson. ""Science should be part of everybody's life. The prerequisite is not that you become a scientist. It's that at the end of the series, you will embrace science and recognize its role in who and what you are.""The Fox and National Geographic preview hosted at the White House on Feb 28, signaled the start of the White House Student Film Festival, and tied in with Obama's efforts to boost the use of technology and science in classrooms around the country. Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey will air Sundays at 9 pm on Fox and Mondays at 10 pm on the National Geographic Channel with bonus footage and behind-the-scenes content. Amazingly, the series will also be shown on 220 channels in 181 countries, and is a group effort from Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane’s Fuzzy Door Productions and Cosmos Studios, the company founded in 2000 by Ann Druyan, Carl Sagan’s widow.Image via Tags:13 part series Cosmos, carl sagan, cosmos, Neil Tyson, New series Cosmos, universe

	Even the president of the United States is into the new ""Cosmos.""
President Barack Obama introduced the new TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" last night (March 9) during the FOX premiere of the new show, a reboot of Carl Sagan's original ""Cosmos"" series.
	""America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dream bigger and reach farther than others imagine,"" Obama said during his introduction. ""That's the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original 'Cosmos.' Today, we're doing everything we can to bring that same sense of possibility to a new generation because there are new frontiers to explore and we need Americans eager to explore them. There are no limits. So, open your eyes, and open your imagination. [Carl Sagan's Astronomical Legacy in Photos]
	The first episode of ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" kicked off the 13-episode season with a sweeping overview of the history of time as told using a ""cosmic calendar."" The show uses animation to bring scientific history to life. Sunday's episode paid homage to Sagan's unique brand of science education through subtle and overt references to the late astronomer's legacy. Neil deGrasse Tyson (the new host of ""Cosmos"") even explained that Sagan changed his life with a touching story at the end of the show about how they met. 
	""I already knew I wanted to be a scientist, but that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become,"" Tyson said of his visit to Sagan's lab at Cornell University in upstate New York. ""He reached out to me and to countless others, inspiring so many of us to study, teach and do science. Science is a cooperative enterprise spanning the generations.""
	Tyson was just in Washington D.C. with Obama for the first ever White House student film festival. Actor and Obama Administration employee Kal Penn, TV personality and CEO of the Planetary Society Bill Nye, and Tyson hosted the film festival at the White House.
The new ""Cosmos"" airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Fox. You can catch a replay of the premiere today (March 10) on National Geographic at 10 p.m. ET/PT.

540	Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and host of National Geographic and Fox’s new show Cosmos, said Sunday that he thinks the media needs to stop providing false balance in stories on scientific subjects like climate change.Host of CNN’s Reliable Sources Brian Stelter asked Tyson whether he thought the media had a responsibility portray science correctly, particularly when discussing climate change.“The media has to sort of come out of this ethos that I think was in principle a good one, but it doesn’t really apply in science,” Tyson said. “The ethos was, whatever story you give, you have to give the opposing view. And then you can be viewed as balanced.”Stelter showed a clip of President Obama’s climate speech last year, in which he decried climate deniers by saying the country didn’t have time for a “meeting of the flat Earth society.” Tyson said the president’s reference was a good example of how the idea of “balance” in scientific stories doesn’t make sense.“In the clip you showed of the president — you don’t talk about the spherical Earth with NASA, and then say ‘now let’s give equal time to the flat Earthers,” he said. “Plus, science is not there for you to cherry pick…You can decide whether or not to believe in it but that doesn’t change the reality of an emergent scientific truth.”Tyson has spoken before about the need for the public to accept scientific facts rather than the talking points of politicians. In 2011, he said people who deny climate change exists need “to be mature enough to recognize something can be true even if you don’t like the consequences of it. That’s what it means to be a mature adult.” And this February, Tyson said on CNN that he hopes America doesn’t wait until climate change has drastically changed the Earth’s landscape to realize that our policies haven’t done enough to prepare us.“When politicians start analyzing the science, I don’t know what to say at that point,” Tyson said. “Are we going to wait until the coastlines get redrawn as the glaciers melt off of Antarctica and Greenland?”Tyson also said he hopes Cosmos, which premiered March 9, can help Americans learn how to decipher scientific facts from political spin and that it can help Americans become better stewards of the Earth.“The goal is to convey why science matters to the person, to our society, to us as shepherds of this planet,” he said. “It involves presenting science in ways that connect to you, so Cosmos can influence you not only intellectually but emotionally, with a celebration of wonder and awe.”	Science

Sunday's incredibly crowded TV schedule saw Fox pitting science against scripted heavy-hitters like The Walking Dead, True Detective and ABC's impressive launch for Resurrection.The broadcast net's follow-up to Carl Sagan's 30-year-old Cosmos: A Personal Voyage brought in 8.5 million viewers across 10 networks -- including Fox's cable nets and the National Geographic Channel. It's a modest haul, given the scope of the launch, but Fox cited global projections north of 40 million viewers for the first week.Among adults 18-49, Cosmos grossed a 2.9 rating.Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, produced by Seth MacFarlane and hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson, fared best on Fox. Fast National returns have the network earning a vast majority of the total haul with 5.8 million viewers.As is the case with all non-live TV, expect a great deal of attention on how much of a lift Cosmos gets from time-shifters.

544	"Change LocationNewscasts & VideosAstrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the new voice of Cosmos.





TORONTO – If you were around in the 1970s, you’ll likely remember the PBS special Cosmos, hosted by renowned astronomer Carl Sagan. For many people, that show was responsible for introducing them to our universe. It was wildly successful, reaching an estimated 700 million people.In the show, Sagan explored not just astronomy, but the very essence of life, from the infinitesimally small, to the uncomprehendingly large. More than 30 years passed and rumours swirled about the possibility of reintroducing the series to a whole new generation.But in our day and age — a time of instant gratification and shortened attention spans — how do you wow the audience in a 13-part show about the universe?Carl Sagan standing next to a model of the Viking lander in Death Valley, California.You put it on network television — in this case, Fox (Global in Canada) — and put funny-man and Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane at the helm.READ MORE: Seth MacFarlane Discusses The ‘Cosmos’You create a “Worldwide Premiere Event” airing it on National Geographic and National Geographic Wild at the same time.You use state-of-the-art graphics depicting the Big Bang, collisions of worlds, and a sleek “spaceship of the mind” to take you on your journey.You also include comic book-like animation to tell historical stories that might otherwise be lost in bland dialogue.And you bring in world renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson to host it. Put this all together and you have a way of capturing the attention span of those who might otherwise pass up the opportunity to learn about our universe.In the 1970s, there were specials like Wild Kingdom, National Geographic Explorer and PBS specials like Cosmos. Science shows actually had science programming. But with the addition of hundreds of channels all vying for our attention, so-called specialty channels that promised science content had to reinvent themselves. In order for science to be appealing these days, it has to be sleek and sexy. National Geographic is now “Nat Geo,” a cable channel with a cool nickname. Shiny graphics, maps, and exciting footage are all used together with narration to provide a more immersive experience. And this is what the new Cosmos is doing.Tyson is a logical choice for taking over where Sagan left off: his enthusiasm and love of astronomy and science is clear. He has mass appeal. And Sagan was a huge influence on Tyson, the two having met while Tyson was a teenager. Tyson has often said that he wants to follow in Sagan’s footsteps.WATCH: Carl Sagan’s influence on Neil deGrasse Tyson The question is whether or not — in the age of the Internet — that this kind of show will have legs. Can science television still capture the attention of millions of viewers when they can look at images from Hubble or a Mars rover while sitting at their desks?But it’s not just about seeing pretty images. It’s about trying to understand what you’re looking at. It’s about putting things into perspective. It’s about learning.It’s time real science was brought back into our homes.Cosmos airs on Global Television Sundays at 9 p.m.

545	"by Trevor Kimball, June 2, 2014It’s been quite awhile since FOX programmed anything but animated shows on Sunday nights — and there certainly hasn’t been anything like Cosmos on the network before. Will their gamble pay off and bring in bigger ratings or, will it be a disappointment? We’ll see.Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is a follow up to the Carl Sagan series from 1980 and is hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. The series follows how humans discovered the laws of nature and the quest for knowledge.The ratings are typically the best indication of a show’s chances of staying on the air. The higher the ratings, the better. This chart will be updated as new ratings data becomes available — typically the following morning, around 11:30am EST/8:30am PST. Refresh to see the latest. 6/2 update: You can see the latest night’s ratings in context here. Note: If you’re not seeing the updated chart, please try reloading the page or view it here. These are the final national numbers (unless noted with an “*”). These are different from the fast affiliate numbers which are just estimates of the actual ratings. The final nationals are typically released within 24 hours of the programming or, in the case of weekends and holidays, a couple days later.What do you think? Do you like the new Cosmos TV series? Do you think it should be cancelled or renewed for a second season?More about: Cosmos, Cosmos: canceled or renewed?, Cosmos: ratings
167 Comments on ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey: Ratings""                    This is a wonderful show. I am beginning to re-think my belief in christianity. The pastor keeps telling us that evolution is a lie, but the evidence is obviously all around us. We were taught in school that Science is truth, yet we are taught in church that it is a lie. I think I will take time away from the church and read more Science.It is people like you, with courage and open mind that got us out of the Dark Ages. I am certain that science will be the most wonderful eye opener in your life! Happy learning :P.dji, You are not funny or clever.  Why always playing the race card? And name calling? Mathematical equations don’t prove anything. Observations prove equations.  That being said,  Neil deGrasse Tyson is a brilliant astrophysicist and an excellent communicator.  He is too preachy however regarding evolution and this bias bleeds through his message.  And that bias detracts from his message in my opinion. He publicly says that he is an avoid athiest.You should watch what you post and say as you don’t know me at all. Signing off.PLEASE leave this show on and have 2nd season.  We’re soooooo tired of sit-coms, reality shows, dramas, etc; all done to death.  This show is interesting.  Can’t the intelligent have at least ONE show we like???this show is for 13 episodes. there will be no seond season. it’s an update to the original. enjoy it .Boring. They took a great show and made it a mess. It’s all over the place.I am a Christian and love this show!  It is a family event in my house. I simply love this program!!C.F. somehow and for some reason I don’t believe the first part of your sentence about being a Christian. Maybe you should check yourself to see of your really a believer.  Just sayin.Randy
You should not judge. You are not God.  People like you will be surprised who makes it and who don’t.  You see Randy, i know my personal relationship with God. Be clear, I am not the judge, nor do I try to be. I’d be very careful if I were you. Just saying.Correct I’m not God.  I’m glad IF you’re a believer.  So you like the god evolution? BTW The “facts” presented do far in the series so far are thrown out there without any proof – the same criticism athiests level at Christians.Randy, no I do not believe in evolution. However, I do believe Cosmos shows the power,  glory,  and greatness of God. I see God’s glory in the Big Bang Theory and everything else. I guess it’s how you look at it. As I said about evolution,  I listen to various opinions, but I am educated enough to respect other theories that differ from mine.  At the same time remain firm in my beliefs without putting down and judging others. One does not preclude the other.Actually Randy, all of the facts that have been presented so far are backed up by experimentation and mathematical equations. I respect where your coming from (being a Christian and all), but america is falling behind in the scientific literacy curve. We need more shows like this to educate the future generations of Americans so they can compete in this scientific literate world.I agree with what you say. I acually have advanced degrees in physics and astrophysics. I own a 20″ goto telescope wlas well as an 11″ SCT and love observational astronomy. I hate being force-fed from the hog trough of evolution which is pretty well so far a constant in this remake. I’m Going atheists Druyan and Tyson spend the remaining episodes on the cosmos instead of trying to explain and throw out wild theories and things they have no supporting evidence for.  Evolution is the faith of the atheist scientist and they’re proselytizing. Go figure.
Peace brother.Randy, I can appreciate your point and respect where you’re coming from.  May God bless you! Your friend in Christ.   😉The reason why the original cosmos was good was because of Carl Sagan.  It was his show and that’s that.  I can’t wait for this show to get cancelled and replaced with another horribly animated show that is ‘Dumb TV’ so that everyone that watched Cosmos now can get so angry, they vomit blood all over their friends as they discuss why 1.God doesn’t exist and 2.  Anyway he’s stupid.FRANK NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL IT AIN’T GETTING CANCELED. PERIOD. THEY SPENT MILLIONS ON IT SO IT GOES FORWARD. GOT IT? nobody said god doesn’t exist and that he’s dumb. now just zip it up and don’t watch.just so you know the fist cosoms was written by sagans wife. this one is to. so i don’t get you’re point. and the president did great. i get you don’t like him but that’s you’re problem.Exactly, and it hasn’t gotten any better. Plodding.  This is why so many people don’t like science. They have lost a staggering number of viewers thus far.I love science and was looking forward to this show, but it moved way too slow and seemed more like a history lesson.  We watched half and then switched to other shows.  I’ll finish watching the recording later and may try it again but it better pick up or We’re done with it.The show was lame complete with Odumba introducing the series. He collected attendance degrees from Columbia and Harvard and sealed all his records. The series presented warmed over theories taking the stereotypical swipes at Christianity and giving Islam the standard free pass. The animations were run-of-the-mill at best. Tyson paid obligatory homage to his idol Sagan who was stated to be the greatest astronomer in the world.  Not. He was a great front man of modern astronomical theories. The whole series should have been updated and not merely retraced.randy keep you’re politics to you’re self. and don’t call names.  you seem like a very unhappy man. carl sagan was a great cosmologist. if ya don’t get theat then crawl back under you’re rock.I’ll express myself as I please.  I’m very happy.  I bought the remake of the original Cosmos Series on dvd when it came out. You are mistaken about Sagan being a great cosmologists. He was a planetary scientist at Cornell. Maybe you should do some study on your own and not believe everything you see on tv. By the way you appear to be illiterate or else drunk by your inappropriate use of syntax.he was also a cosmologist. he also did physics. yes he did planetary science but he did a lot more. and you come across as an angry right wing hack. so i say to you don’t watch. and good bye and good luck. and like i said before you’re rock awaits you.Great show for the  average person who is interested in science but doesn’t have the time or energy to watch a long winded explanation of every aspect of the underlying facts that support the theories.   Can’t wait for the next oneActually the series injected politics into it by inviting dear leader to introduce it. Why not have a CEO or union leader to introduce it? They have just as much if not more knowledge about the subject as Obama.Randy, do you really believe that the earth is 6000 years old??  Do you really believe that, despite the overwhelming physical evidence proving that to be incorrect?  If the answer is yes, you should reconsider who the true Odumba really is here.No one is swiping at Christianity, nor Islam.  Facts are facts, and they are being presented impartially in this show.Great show.  It did start a little slow, but great overall.  Everyone I knew watched it, but maybe we are all those that appreciate science and don’t watch dumb TV.the show is great. the ratings are lame. so i guess we have dumbed down so much that nobody cares about science anymore. but it will stay on the air. this cost a fortune to make.The ratings are low because the show sucks.Randy is fundamentally correct.  And the anti-Christian bigotry is really tiresome.Anti-christian bigotry? The show only described what it was like back then with the various churches in Europe. What did you expect?What anti-Christian bigotry?  The show mentions prominent scientists from centuries gone by, who used their belief in Christianity and Islam to further and sometimes impede scientific discoveries.  There has been absolutely no bigotry whatsoever in this show.No infringement of previously copyrighted material is intended on this site. DMCACopyright © TV Series Finale. All rights reserved.

	In early 2018, Facebook made another 
	big announcement regarding its ever-changing algorithm. This time, it was a shift to prioritize content from family and friends instead of publishers. While the news wrought chaos in the digital world, here at RebelMouse, we ultimately believe this is a good thing for organic growth and social ROI. But neither can be achieved without a speedy site.

	If you're familiar with our 
	Layout & Design tool, then you know it's comprised of columns, rows, and different sets of elements that can be nested inside each other. There are also Conditional Content elements, which allow you to set IF statements that display elements based on conditions you define.

For example:

	IF the site is rendering on mobile, show four posts.
	
	IF the site is rendering on desktop, show eight posts.

	We've now upgraded this feature to make it even more comprehensive:
In 2017, Facebook began taking drastic measures to reduce the spreading of fake news. But it's no easy feat, and the company is devoting this coming year to ""fixing"" Facebook and sorting through all the backlash that resulted from the fake news fallout. We saw this unfold after Facebook eliminated users' ability to edit preview links, header text, and images associated with content shared on the platform. We touched on our solution to this here.Today, there's more you can do to fully reclaim your content freedom and prove you're not posting fake news. You must verify your domain. Facebook's domain verification process provides a way for you to claim ownership of your domain in Business Manager. This ownership allows you to control editing privileges of your links and content to prevent both misuse of your domain and the spreading of misinformation.Here are the steps you need to take to get this done:
	Using RebelMouse, you can effortlessly customize teaser headlines and images to tailor your content for key distribution channels, thereby increasing engagement opportunities.

548	"One of the tricky things about science is that it’s always changing.Especially when what you’re trying to do with the science is put it on TV. Programs only a couple years old can be rendered out of date and practically useless by new discoveries, and the former, inaccurate way of understanding becomes of interest only to cultural historians. When we talk about the Earth being flat today, it’s often as a metaphor for a closed-minded adherance to old ideas (see also: people who believe the earth is like 150 years old, or whatever the new Earth theory du jour might be). The thirteen episodes of the original 1980 PBS series “Cosmos” is easily some of the best science television ever brought to the small screen, and not least because Carl Sagan was such a brilliant presenter, that magical and rare brand of teacher whose enthusiasm and wonder infects everyone he reaches. It was also a comprehensive and accessible approach to a field of science most people would never have bothered to try to understand, and as such it stands as a powerful turning point in popular culture. Still, only six years later, enough of its material had changed to warrant a special edition employing not only new narration and information, but new computer animations. Such is the ephemeral nature of science television. And not all of these changes are a result of massive cultural shifts, such as the change from the early belief that the Earth centered the universe to today’s far more complicated perspective. Keep in mind that the very first Earth-like planet orbiting within a star’s habitable zone was only discovered by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope in 2011. While scientists like Sagan had certainly hypothesized the existence of other Earth-like planets somewhere out there -- after all, it seems unlikely that ours would be that much of a fluke -- we had no evidence that any existed until three years ago, which means all of the current material on life elsewhere in the universe written prior to that time would be missing a pretty remarkable piece of information. (As of today, the Kepler mission has detected 961 confirmed exoplanets since it began operations in 2009. 961!) Still, Cosmos has held up in spite of being out of date, because of its thoughtful, congenial, and often philosophical approach to popular science education. It even got a boost in 2009 when music project Symphony of Science made an autotuned music video on YouTube called “A Glorious Dawn” featuring Cosmos clips, which introduced the series to a generation that might never have heard of it otherwise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc

 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbcWhen the original Cosmos first appeared on Netflix, I was ecstatic to have a chance to revisit it, but as much as I loved doing so, I wished for a new, up-to-date version that included all the new cosmological science of the past thirty years, even if it had to do so without Sagan himself, who died in 1996.And then, in 2011, I got my wish: it was announced that a Cosmos sequel WAS in the works, put together by original co-creators Ann Druyan and Steven Soter, the ultimate Cool Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and…. Seth McFarlane. Yeah. I’ll admit this last threw me, but apparently it’s largely due to McFarlane’s influence that this new series has happened at all, and even better, that it has happened on a major network -- Fox -- rather than being relegated to Discovery Science with the rest of the television brainy crap, way up in the dusty attic of the cable channel guide where only nerds like me will go to find it. The new Cosmos is important for a few reasons -- it has the potential to revitalize a popular interest in science, as the original did, at a time when science funding is not particularly central on most people’s radar when it comes to stuff they give a crap about (not to mention a time in which science seems to be going backward in some quarters, owing to the influence of certain religious groups threatened by the idea of an observable universe that does not include a large man in the sky directing all things). Also, it’s simply beautiful. both to look at, and to listen to. While Carl Sagan can never be replaced, Neil deGrasse Tyson is an equally gifted traveling companion on this imaginary trip through space and time, and is just as compelling and passionate about these subjects as Sagan was, but in his own way. (I won’t lie, when NGT told the story about meeting Sagan as a seventeen-year-old aspiring scientist, I WEPT A BIT. I actually cried a few times throughout, because I am emotional space weirdo.)Expectations for this series were extraordinarily high, at least in the nerdy circles in which I tend to run, but to my surprise I felt like last night’s premiere actually did recapture the grandeur and wonder of the original, a feat I would have thought impossible. The use of animation for the historical segments was also a nice touch, and the dramatic approach made what could have been very dry historical information much more broadly appealing.Like its predecessor, the new Cosmos will comprise a total of thirteen episodes, and I'm so psyched about it that I plan on watching shows week-to-week, rather than letting the series pile up on my DVR and wasting a weekend gorging on it, as is my wont. (In fact, I was trying to remember the last time I was this excited about a network TV show, and I'm pretty sure it was Muppets Tonight, in 1996. I hope Cosmos works out better.)But what did you think? Was the new Cosmos everything you hoped? DID YOU CRY TOO?

549	"licensed under 'Fair Use' for critical commentary and discussion of the film, television or media presentation and its contentslicensed under 'Fair Use' for critical commentary and discussion of the film, television or media presentation and its contentsAnd I loved it!The first episode was everything I could have hoped for! The art is striking, the science is more up to date, and the Tyson carries Sagan's torch of teaching, mentoring, and love of science very well. Basically, the guy knew he had HUGE shoes to fill and he did it. Homerun. Out of the park. Hands down.This first episode packed a great deal into it's first hour (40-ish minutes if you don't count the commercials) and I was riveted! I sat on my couch at home with my computer on my lap posting #COSMOS status updates on my Facebook page as I watched and joined in as many of my Facebook friends joined me in the debut of this great series.The only complaint I have is that it was too short. There were parts that felt rushed and I was hoping the'd go into deeper, but I suppose that's what future episodes are for! :)There were little that did not paste a smile to my face, but there was one part that literally brought tears to my eyes. It was Tyson's commentary, his homage to Sagan as he recounted the first time they met when Tyson was a teenager.Tyson held true to the theme that science is an ongoing process in which the former generation 'passes the torch' to the next and trusts that the will continue the search for meaning and our place within the cosmos. His story was so touching that it conveyed a man who truly loved and deeply respected the man that inspired him to enter into the sciences and who later would take up a journey and a call to carry on Sagan's legacy.This is a series that will speak to those who love the old series (and I certainly do, I watch it when I'm drunk) and those who are new to it.This is what I think. What do you think?""We are made of starstuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.""

550	"To paraphrase the late Carl Sagan, billions and billions failed to show up for ""Cosmos.""A reboot of Sagan's 1980 smash science series on PBS, ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" premiered on Fox on Sunday, this time with outspoken astrophysicist and science educator Neil deGrasse Tyson as host and — of all people — ""Family Guy"" writer-producer Seth MacFarlane as executive producer along with Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan. (Sagan died in 1996.)But despite heavy promotion and curiosity — a science documentary right after ""Family Guy,"" how crazy is that? — ""Cosmos"" did not exactly deliver a big bang, with 5.8 million total viewers, according to Nielsen.PHOTOS: WGA's top 101 showsThat amounted to third place in the 9 p.m. time slot. Instead of true science, more viewers seemed to prefer sci-fi drama, with 13.3 million tuning in to the launch of ABC's ""Resurrection,"" about the dead returning to life. It was this season's most-watched drama premiere after CBS' ""Intelligence,"" which had the benefit of an ""NCIS"" lead-in back in January.As for ""Cosmos,"" it premiered simultaneously on 10 networks, including Fox, National Geographic, FX and FXX.

553	Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson’s smooth voice and cool manner steered the Ship of Imagination through the known history of the cosmos and through the development of modern science in the debut episode of “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” on Sunday.Reviving the immensely popular show “Cosmos: A Personal Voyage,” hosted by the late Carl Sagan, Tyson has some big shoes to fill.Here’s a look at Tyson’s maiden voyage, taking the Ship of Imagination’s helm and setting it on course for a 13-episode series (the Ship of Imagination was a feature of Sagan’s show, adopted also in the current series). Episode 1, titled “Standing up in the Milky Way” begins with a promise. Tyson tells the audience he will explore everything we know from the “infinitesimal to the infinite,” taking us through universes smaller than atoms and other wonders of the cosmos.He breaks up the known universe into various lines of our cosmic address. The solar system is one line; the Milky Way galaxy is another; the Virgo supercluster—a group of about 100 billion galaxies of which ours is but one— is the last known line of our address.File photo of star cluster M13. (Shutterstock)The perspective in the episode continually pans out for a broader and broader perspective in which our world is a smaller and smaller speck.Skimming over Venus, we see the “runaway greenhouse effect has turned it into a kind of hell,” says Tyson. Understanding this effect on Venus was one of Sagan’s major contributions to science. Jupiter’s red spot, a hurricane three times the size of Earth, provides the first comparison by which we see our planet’s size diminishing in the ever-expanding view.Beyond Voyager 1—the spacecraft that has traveled farther than any other launched from Earth—and beyond the cloud of comets that encircles our solar system, we enter “the deeper waters of this vast cosmic ocean.”On the subject of extraterrestrials, Tyson speaks of the possibility that life may exist outside our concept of life. “But what do we know about life?” he asked. “We’ve met only one kind before—Earth life.”Our eyes have limited sight. Tyson shows that when we first started to view space in infrared, the kind of technology used in night-vision, we found way more stars and planets than we could see before.The visuals are engaging, and even elegant in the way they flow. Tyson’s descriptions are even poetic at times; he describes the rogue planets detected by infrared as “orphans cast away from their mother stars during the chaotic birth of their native star systems.”On the right is the Orion Nebula as seen with infrared, on the left is the same nebula without infrared. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/Univ. of Toledo/NOAO)The bubble theory has its place in this episode. The screen pans out to show our universe as a bubble surrounded by many other bubbles—so many, in the end, that each universe is like a droplet of water in a massive, rushing waterfall.“Feeling a little small?” asks Tyson. “We may just be little guys living on a speck of dust afloat in a staggering immensity.”This is where he takes us back to Earth.Niagara Falls (Shutterstock)An animated episode tells the story of Giordano Bruno, a 16th-century friar who said the sun is simply a star like so many others. He burned at the stake for his heresy.A thread that ran through the episode was the idea that science has been wrong before—that the scientific community has been so certain of its knowledge that it would shun bold individuals who proposed different perspectives.Will we see Tyson propose any bold or new perspectives throughout the series? Thus far, it all seems to fit fairly well within the bounds of conventional scientific understandings.Bruno had a vision, a startlingly accurate vision of the structure of the cosmos. He was not a scientist. Tyson calls Bruno’s understanding and vision a “lucky guess.” He falls short of considering Bruno’s ability to accurately understand the cosmos through a spiritual vision an ability that may relate to the little-understood wonders of the human mind. Portrait, a derivative modern illustration of Giordano Bruno taken from a modern version of “Livre du Recteur” (1578), University of Geneva. (Wikimedia Commons)File photo of a calendar. (Shutterstock)Another historical perspective fills the second part of the cosmic saga. The history of the known universe is put in terms of a calendar year. Jan. 1 is the Big Bang, Dec. 31 is now. Every month is a billion years and every day is 40 million years.The Big Bang is presented like a scene from an action movie, with Tyson facing the huge explosion, a silhouette with his arms heroically outstretched.The first stars appeared on Jan. 10, our sun appeared on Aug. 31 (4.5 billion years ago), and the final 14 seconds of Dec. 31 are recorded human history.Moses was born seven seconds ago, Buddha six seconds ago, Jesus five seconds ago, Mohammed three seconds ago, and at the very last second came the scientific method.Tyson wrapped up the episode with thoughts of Sagan. Tyson first met Sagan in 1975. Sagan, already famous, took the time to meet with this 17-year-old from the Bronx who had aspirations of becoming a scientist. They spent a Saturday afternoon together in Ithaca, N.Y. Sagan signed a book for Tyson with the message, “For Neil, a future astronomer.”Forty years later, Tyson has taken the torch from Sagan and continued on a mission to bring scientific exploration to a broad audience. He closed the first episode with the words, “Now, come with me, our journey is just beginning.”Carl Sagan, a co-founder of The Planetary Society, at the incorporation of the Society in 1980. (NASA/JPL)Nat Geo will rebroadcast the episode on Monday, March 10 at 10 p.m. ET with extra content. The next episode, “Some of the Things That Molecules Do,” will air on March 16, 2014 at 9 p.m. ET in the United States across 10 networks of 21st Century Fox.

President Barack Obama introduced the premiere of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey on Sunday night and took the opportunity to tout the importance of discovery and exploration.""America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dreamed bigger and reached farther than others imagined,"" he said in his intro (watch it below). ""That's the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original Cosmos.""PHOTOS: 2014's New Broadcast and Cable TV ShowsSeth MacFarlane teamed with Sagan’s original creative collaborators -- writer/executive producer Ann Druyan and co-writer, astronomer Steven Soter -- to conceive the new 13-part series.In his intro, Obama goes on to encourage viewers to use their imaginations and added that there are ""new frontiers to explore.""""Open your eyes, and open your imagination,"" he said.

The long-awaited Cosmos: A Space Time Odyssey aired last night on Fox hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, with an opening by President Obama. Nearly 6 million people tuned in to watch the revival of the show first created by astronomer Carl Sagan more than 30 years ago.“America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dream bigger and reach farther than other imagine,” Obama said, during his 30-second intro. “That’s the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original Cosmos. Today we’re doing everything we can to bring that same sense of possibility to a new generation.”In that same spirit, NASA released a set of space photos to accompany the premiere and to inspire with their beauty. The photos are in the slideshow above.As for the first episode, it didn’t disappoint. Tyson took viewers on an incredible journey. Phil Plait, who writes the Bad Astronomy blog for Slate, put the experience beautifully: “It’s gorgeous, both for the eyes and the brain. The special effects are wonderful and wondrous and Neil Tyson’s style and voice are a good fit. This first episode is all about showing how small we are.”In the grand scope of the universe, that’s pretty tiny. If its creation were a one-year calendar, humans don’t show up until the last hour of December 31, and much of our history happens within the last few seconds of the year.The episode ends with a moving story of Tyson’s initial meeting with Sagan, when the former was just a teenager from the Bronx who knew he wanted to be a scientist. It was a nice moment, humanizing scientists in a way conversations about science typically don’t. If you missed it, the show airs again tonight on the National Geographic channel. Future episodes will air at 9 p.m. on Sunday nights on Fox. MORE FROM WEATHER.COM: Today’s Top Videos© 2018 The Weather Company, LLC"	Science

558	"Photo from Fox, from the trailer for the showAs I write this, the world premiere of the new, updated version of Cosmos just aired. I’ve been waiting for this a long, long, time—I first wrote about it in 2011!—and I can say, I’m happy with it. It was lovingly done, fun to watch, and had me wanting more.Phil Plait writes Slate’s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!  I won’t go into too much detail here; instead, I’ll urge you to watch the replay tonight on National Geographic (check your local listing, etc., etc.). But there are a few points I’d like to mention.Before I even start, let me note that a lot of people questioned airing this show on Fox instead of, say, PBS. This was done on purpose, as a way to get the show out to people who may not otherwise be exposed to science like this. I think that was a clever and wise decision. Good on them.Now about the show: It’s gorgeous, both for the eyes and the brain. The special effects are wonderful and wondrous, and Neil Tyson’s style and voice are a good fit. This first episode is all about showing how small we are; it starts with a brief overview of the Universe (even writing that makes me smile), going from the Earth to the limits of how far we can see.Interestingly, the next two segments are spent telling the story of Giordano Bruno, a 16th-century Italian monk who theorized that the stars were suns, that other planets existed, and that life existed everywhere. He saw this as an obvious extension to the glory of God, but of course the Church took a dimmer view, convicted him of heresy, and burned him at the stake.Top Comment

Cosmos spent a lot of time on this, and I think they were making an interesting and subtle point. A shallow takeaway is that they were slamming religion, but I don’t think that was the reason behind those segments; that could’ve been done faster, in only a few minutes.Instead, I see it as making the more interesting and bigger point about suppression of thought and the grandeur of freedom of exploration of ideas. Certainly, the Church was stuck in its dogma, burning Bruno and later having a go at Galileo. But you’ll note that the story was told with the focus on Bruno himself, his ideas, and how he could not be deterred from spreading the word about the greater Universe. Even as he was marched off to his death, his mind was among the stars.Yes, that doesn’t cast the Church in a positive light, but guess what: The Church wasn’t exactly a force for enlightenment back then. Its arrogance held it back while humanity moved on. Cosmos was honest about this and still managed to present this story as a paean to human curiosity and drive for exploration. And to be honest, Tyson then discussed how Bruno’s vision of the Universe was a lucky guess. That’s the thing about science: It spares no truth for comforting fables.But there’s more.Photo by FoxThe next segment was about the Cosmic Calendar, retooling all of time such that the 13.8 billion year history of the Universe is rescaled to one year. On this scale, the Sun itself wasn’t formed until late August, the dinosaurs were wiped out on December 30, and all of human written history took place in the last 14 seconds before midnight on New Year’s Eve.Again, as in the previous segments, the Universe makes us seem small, insignificant. Through science we have learned that the Universe was not made for us, and we are not at its center, and we hold little or no special place in it. Indeed, its scale crushes our aspirations to dust.Yet here we are, contemplating it. Our greatest achievement is to understand that we are a part of it, that we can understand it at all, and we can explore it if given the freedom to do so. That, to me, was the point of this first episode. And it’s a damn fine one.Finally, the show ends on a personal note for Tyson, talking about Carl Sagan, the original writer and host of Cosmos. I won’t spoil it, because it was lovely, touching, and remarkably well-done. But it does something I wish more programs would: It humanizes scientists and shows science as a human endeavor. It is the most human of endeavors, in fact. It is our imagination, our urge to explore, our desire to discover, and our unquenchable need to find things out.

559	" UPDATE: Cosmos writer Steven Soter responds to my critique here.The first episode of the ambitious reboot of Cosmos, which debuted last night, closely follows the template of the first episode of the original. It also differs in some important ways–most of them right on target, but one of them unfortunately off the mark.Giordano Bruno: cosmologist, genius, heretic, martyr, jerk. (Credit: David Oliver)Special effects have advanced greatly since Carl Sagan’s 1980 original; the new visualizations are both more dramatic and more realistic. Science has advanced greatly as well. The updated Cosmos discusses free-floating planets between the stars, shows real images of Uranus and Neptune, and gives a precise age to the universe (that would be 13.8 billion years). All of these things were unknown 34 years ago.In overall content, the new series introduces two major innovations. One is a tribute to Carl Sagan, a moving segment  in which host Neil DeGrasse Tyson recalls his teenage encounter with the revered astronomer. The other is an extended tribute to the 16th-century Italian philosopher and theologian Giordano Bruno.Here is where Cosmos 2.0 runs into its big problem, missing out both on a chance to set history straight and to embrace the generous, forward-looking spirit of Sagan.Bruno is well known as a martyr to the cause of modern astronomy. As Tyson intones in Cosmos, “for one man, Copernicus didn’t go far enough.” Starting in the late 1500s, Bruno argued not only in favor of Copernicus’s sun-centered cosmology, he also proposed that space was infinite in extent; that stars were other suns, surrounded by other Earths; and that those other worlds were also populated.His belief in an infinite universe, reflecting the infinite glory of God, got Bruno shunned and exiled from country after country. He grew impoverished and largely friendless, but refused to recant. Eventually Bruno was imprisoned by the Church, and burned at the stake in 1600–10 years before Galileo announced his first observations that confirmed Copernicus was right.It’s a powerful, tragic, and cautionary tale, right?Meet the Real Giordano BrunoThat depiction in the new Cosmos matches the standard textbook story of Bruno, but it is misleading and in some ways downright wrong. For starters, Bruno was not the first to link the idea of infinite space with the infinite glory of God. That idea actually originated with Nicolas of Cusa, a German philosopher who lived a century earlier (and who wrote about the notion of infinite space even before Copernicus, though not in a detailed astronomical way). Nicolas kept his infinite theology within the Catholic framework, however, and suffered no ill consequences for his views.A mystic reaches toward the infinite. This woodcut, adapted in the first episode of Cosmos to depict Bruno, originated in a 19th-century popular science text. (Credit: Camille Flammarion)Bruno also was not much of a Copernican, or by most accounts much of an astronomer at all. His interests were theological, not physical, and his astronomical writings are considered amateurish and confused. Bruno’s talents lay elsewhere. He performed great feats of memory (using an early form of mnemonics), he was accomplished in mathematics but also in magic, and he was a true theological and philosophical innovator in his vision of endless inhabited worlds.In Cosmos, Tyson does carefully say that Bruno was not a scientist, and instead describes that picture of infinite worlds as a “guess.” But Bruno was not guessing. He was advancing his own, heretical theology, which goes a long way to understanding the real reason that he was burned at the stake.The Roman Inquisition listed eight charges against Bruno. His belief in the plurality of worlds was just one. The others involved denying the divinity of Jesus, denying the virgin birth, denying transubstantiation, practicing magic, and believing that animals and objects (including the Earth) possessed souls. You could fairly call Bruno a martyr to the cause of religious freedom, but his cosmic worldview was neither a deduction nor a guess. It was a philosophical corollary of his heterodox belief that God and souls filled all of the universe.Despite his heresies, Bruno was neither impoverished nor alone. In reality, he had a series of powerful patrons. In 1579, he was appointed a professor of philosophy in Tolouse, France. In 1581, King Henry III of France offered him a lucrative lectureship at the Sorbonne. In 1583 he visited England, lived with the ambassador to France, and met regularly with the Court…and so on. The gaunt, lonely fellow you see on screen in Cosmos is not the real Bruno.Nor was Bruno the simple, humble figure shown on TV. A major reason he moved around so much is that he was argumentative, sarcastic, and drawn to controversy. He engaged in bitter academic disputes, many of which had nothing to do with his cosmic framework. One example He fled France because of a violent dispute about the proper use of a compass (seriously).None of this means that Bruno in any way deserved his fate. But neither does he deserve to be reduced to a cartoon about intellectual freedom. He was a brilliant, complicated, difficult man.Bruno’s impassioned statements and outrageous personality alienated many of his natural supporters. Neither Johannes Kepler nor Galileo thought much of him. Kepler even wrote specifically to refute Bruno’s ideas. Citing Bruno as the “one man” who dared to go beyond Copernicus also obscures another, equally important and often overlooked historical figure.Thomas Digges, the Forgotten CopernicanWhile Bruno was making grand pronouncements and racking up enemies, Thomas Digges was quietly doing much more to bring the ideas of Copernicus into the  mainstream of European thinking. Digges was one of the leading astronomers in 16th century England–a place where Catholic doctrine obviously did not hold the kind of sway that it did in Italy. In 1576, Digges published the first English translation of Copernicus’s revolutionary (literally) text, De revolutionibus.Digges’s goal, in the words of science historian Francis Johnson, was to make the ideas of Copernicus and the sun-centered universe available “to the skilled artisans and mechanics whose intelligent co-operation was so necessary to successful research in the sciences.” Digges was not just an astronomer, he was also a popularizer of science. You might call him the Carl Sagan of his day.The universe of Thomas Digges, 1576. He placed the stars outside the orbits of the planets–the first explicit illustration of infinite space. (Credit: Galileo Project)Along with his translations, Digges added commentary and new ideas, making it clear that the Copernican model was more than philosophy, it was a physically real model of the solar system. Even more significant, it was Digges–not Bruno–who first broached the idea that a sun-centered universe could well be infinite in extent.If all revolved around the Earth, then the stars needed to be confined to a shell that could likewise circle around us once a day. But if the Earth is in motion, then there is no reason why space could not be open and unbounded. Digges made this point explicit and even created a drawing showing, for the first time in history, how the stars might be scattered through endless space outside our solar system.All of this seems very much in the spirit of Sagan: taking an audacious idea, explaining it to a broad audience, and citing philosophical precedent from classical Greek literature to show that the idea was not so heretical after all.Science and Religion in TandemOK, you may still be thinking that this is much ado about nothing, splitting hairs over old astronomical history. I believe otherwise. The story of Bruno and Digges has a lot to say about the way science operates today, and about the spiritual side of science that Sagan was so adept at exploring.One irony of the Cosmos narrative is that Bruno very likely got some of his ideas from Digges, since Digges was widely read and Bruno spent two years in England in the 1580s. A second, deeper irony is that in trying to show how science and religion sometimes worked hand in hand, Cosmos missed a chance to showcase a key episode in brokering peace between the two sides.Bruno was a pugilist and an ideologue. In many of his ideas he was right–wildly, spectacularly right–but his method of spreading his ideas alienated his supporters. More importantly, his ideas sprang from faith nearly as much as did the ideas of the Church; Bruno was far from a scientist in the modern sense.Digges, in contrast, was focused on advancing the work of Copernicus. He helped lay the intellectual groundwork for Kepler and Galileo, and established England as a beachhead of progressive scientific thought. “The influence of Digges’ treatise on contemporary astronomical thought can hardly be overestimated,” Johnson continues. Digges grafted the idea of infinite space onto Copernicus’s idea of a sun-centered solar system, showing that the two ideas naturally go hand in hand.By presenting the heliocentric system not as heresy but as an extension of classical learning, Digges pointed out a path forward: away from superstition and theological debate, toward the modern world in which scientific theories own real power as physical descriptions of nature. He also implicitly presented science as a cumulative intellectual journey, with each generation expanding on earlier ideas, testing their validity, inviting further questions.I suspect Carl Sagan would approve. Over to you, Cosmos, for episode 2.Follow me on Twitter: @coreyspowell  Great post!  As a Christian who also believes in evolution, I felt Cosmos missed an opportunity to build bridges.  Your words here are helpful in that cause.One scientist can build 100 briges in the same time a fundamentalist destroys 1.000.???!!!$#!T And the converse is true as well.But look around and ask, who are the dogmatists who are suppressing contrary opinions today? It’s not a church-versus-secularism as presented in this myth, the modern players following the inquisitional/suppressive style inhabit different social structures. Just sayin’….“In truth, there are only two kinds of people; those who accept dogma and know it, and those who accept dogma and don’t know it.” ― G.K. ChestertonThe Science VS Religion crap is gettign old, and so is the misuse of the term Fundamentalist. In reality, there wee no Fundamentalists in Mediaval or Renasaucne Europe. Fundamentalism began in the 20th Century in America. its also nto the violent, hostile force its depicted as.There will always be debate between science and religion in the way one compares physical evidence to metaphysical evidence. The literal interpretation of religious writings likely existed at the same time as when writing was developed so that is more a function of closed mindedness that is seen in extreme branches of all religions. Historically, the fundamentalists and extreme likely became hostile and began wars more readily because their boundaries of accepted behaviours allowed little or no bending.Dare I say that religion tends to be more closed while science tends to be more open. Moreover, some religions are stricter and orthodox while science is and needs to keep an open and creative mindset.Alan Braganza  ,There will always be debate between science and religion in the way one compares physical evidence to metaphysical evidence.Not really. Religion often poitns ot physical eience ( ad again relgiion is a bl;anket term for many differnt things.) Sicenceoftne uses Models base don Mathematics rather than concrete observations. The literal interpretation of religious writings likely existed at the same time as when writing was developed so that is more a function of closed mindedness that is seen in extreme branches of all religions.I have no idea what your saign here. But not everyone hwo tskes Relgiosu writtigns Literally is closed Minded, nor extremist. Historically, the fundamentalists and extreme likely became hostile and began wars Actually no war has ever been STartedby a FUndamentalist. The term, while todya much abused, refers to a Protestant Christain Movment that itself was a Reaction to Modernism. Threre were no FUndamentalists until the 20th Century, or perhapd the mod t late 19th if you inclide certain movments that dfevelope dinto Fundamentlaism but werent called this.more readily because their boundaries of accepted behaviours allowed little or no bending.ANd yiru evidence for this is what, exacgly?Dare I say that religion tends to be more closed while science tends to be more open.Neither are “Open” or “CLosed” at all. Peopel are OPen Minded and willignt i acpt New Ideas, or Peopel are CLosed Minded and reuse New Ideas. Relgiion and Science are just terms we use ot describe what peopel do. Moreover, some religions are stricter and orthodox while science is and needs to keep an open and creative mindset.Bunk. The Sicnetific COmmunity is oftne very cloed ot new Ideas and potects its own Orhtodoxy, and Relgiion sees Reform Movements all the Time.You are a christian who also believes in evolution? Wow, good job, here’s a sticker for you.You also believe in magical skydaddies and other horrible nonsense, so you are not much more rational than your creationist peers.You’re an intolerant imbecile.
Funny, the same thing you call religious people.Oh no. I’m so hurt. I bet you get all warm and fuzzy when you think that your god will punish me?Don’t flatter yourself. No one thinks or could care less about small angry people like you. Crawl back into your hole.why are so angry at the individual and dehumanize them in such a way for stating a harmless opinion that would other wise be crushed by the very institution he is criticizing when given enough power by hateful individuals like you?You mean liek hwo the Sovietsd killed peopel simply for beign Relgiious? oh thats right, we’re suppoed tot hink that had nothgin to do with Atheism.Face Reality, the idea of Christaisn wantign to kill peoepl who disagree is a trope, not a Reality. its doubtful that in the modern orld, if the Chruch were givne real absolut power we’d see them crush all opposition mrcileessly. Meanwhile, the original poser yoru defendign Dehumanised peopel for meley beleivign God existed.The soviets killed atheist to. I doubt Trotsky and his followers were killed for his christian beliefs by Stalin. They sought to eliminate any tyrannical institution or anything perceived as a threat  to their tyrannical institutions.There is a difference though. It’s not like the Soviets killed people who happened to be Chhristians becaue they saw them as a Threat politically, for reasons other than their Religion. The Sviets killed several Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and other assorted Religious Clergy expliitly under the Doctrine of State Atheism. The goasl was the eradication of Religion and the development of a Purely Atheistic State.Trotsky was killed for his opposition to Stalinism, but hundreds of Orthodox Priets and Bishops were killed simply becau they wre Orthodox Priests or Bishops.it’s intellectually dishonest to pretend the Societs never killed anyone motivated by their Atheism.> it’s intellectually dishonest to pretend the Societs never killed anyone motivated by their Atheism.Because they weren’t you ignorant christard.SO when the SOviet explicitly killed people who beleived in God for the explicit Purposeof eradicating beleif in God and generatign an Ateist SOciety, that was not motivated by Atheism?  Come on now.Religion has no tolerance for any free speech which is against it and it should be ridiculed for it. One beautiful quote: “Ridicule is the only weapon which can be used
against unintelligible propositions. Ideas must be distinct before
reason can act upon them; and no man ever had a distinct idea of the
trinity. – Thomas Jefferson”And atheists wonder why they have such an image problem?For pointing out to the obvious?He believes in some magical being who counts the fall of every sparrow and sends you to hell for not believing in him.Do you really expect educated people to take theists seriously?You know nothing about him except for what he revealed here, yet you feel you can pass judgment on his whole belief system.Isn’t that enough?What part of christianity is rational?Well, Christainity is Ratioanl in its exploration of the Human condition, such as its treatment of Sin, Forgiveness, and Stonement. From a purely Psychological Standpoint, the idea that e need to forgive others, as well as let go of our pasts and embace a future, and that we can, in fact, change, soemthignthat in the Time and plce Christainity was formed in was radical, hs been proven True. Regardless of yorublefis inthe Afterlife, rhe proccess of Temproal Forgiveness and redemotion inthis Life is vry useful and still employed by contemproary Psychology. If yu read the Early Chruch fathers, you’d also see a wealth ofundertandign in ho the Human Midn works.Then there’s ideas about God and the afterlife which you will fidn Irrational, but which don’t actually viilate causality or any other Rational thing. Even if we aep the “no evidence” claim, the ideas do nto ontradic what we do know.a better wuestion is, what part of Christainity is irrational?The best you will liekly give is in the representation fo Christain ebelfis from men liek Dawkins which really won’t be what Chrstaisn beleifve at all, such as God sending you to Hell just for not beeliv ng in Him orother useless crivel we’ve all heard before.You sound more like a politician than a believer in science.have you ever bothered to look up the word “Caricature’ in a dictionary?You arent describing Christian beeklifs, you’re oversimplifyign them absed on what Militant Atheists have used as propaganda.Not all of them are dicks. One inviolable rule on this site: all discourse must be carried out in a civil way. It is Discover policy, and it is also just common sense. Nobody has ever changed someone else’s mind with insults and name-calling. Some words from Carl Sagan for all sides to consider: “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.”I did not insult anyone and I didn’t call anyone names. I merely pointed out to the fact that a christian who is not creationist is just one tiny step less absurd than a creationist christian.Also, you are mistaken if you think that quote of Sagan’s is somehow defending theism.You were very clearly insulting that commenter, and were far from trying to establish common ground.  You surely didn’t give him any incentive to consider your point of view.  Sagan was more open theistic possibilities than you assume.  In Contact, he even imagines a scenario wherein the Creator seems to have left a signature embedded in the value of pi.  There are limits to where reason has taken man, so far, and Sagan acknowledged that.Insulting? No.I merely reminded the commenter that there is nothing rational about christian dogmas. If you think that was insulting then I suppose that means that you demand special rights for religions and religious people and judge them by completely different standards.I find it funny though, that you cite Contact (Sagan’s work of FICTION) in which a group of religious terrorists blow up the first machine humans have built, killing multiple people in the process.
Sagan was open-minded, yes, but he was not gullible, and he rejected the idea of gods, theistic possibilities and funny things like that, because there’s no evidence to support claims of divine interventions, virgin births, resurrections and whatnot.Sagan was critiquing fundamentalism and distinguishing it from other religious characters in the novel whom he deeply respected.  You, in contrast, conflated both groups, saying that any theist is about as worthy of ridicule as outright fundamentalists.  You were, in essence, denying that Sagan’s distinction is at all valid.  That Sagan goes further and posits that a search for some Creator (divine or otherwise) is a task is worthy of even the most advanced civilizations is utterly incompatible with the stark judgment you made about any deviation from atheism.  Sagan was an atheist, but he was not wedded to his position beyond all hope of reason.  He just didn’t see the evidence that he clearly hoped was out there.  I’m guessing he died with that hope still in him.  Human aspiration isn’t limited to what we know of the universe.You don’t even seem to understand that Deism is a kind of Theism, and prefer to pretend that they re distinct. My guess is, you’re just following yoru own Religiosu Dogma and “Fundamentalism”. Christian beelifs aren’t as irrational as modern Militant Atheiss liek to proclaim them, and the ides that Rarional people cannot be Relgiiosu or that Relgiion itelf is inhernaly Irrational, especially Christianity, is just another Dogma that is reiterated by peopel who refuse to even consider the possibilit that Christianity can eb Ratioanlly defended.No one is askign you judge Christain ideas by a different standard, but in Reality you already are. You’ve decided A Priori that they are wrong, and Irrational, and even stupid, and that no Ratioanl person can accept hem. You dont do this woth other beelifs, expect maybe other Relgiins liek islam.The fact is, you don’t evaluate Christain ideas hoenslty, you’ve just declreed them wrong becaue it fis yoru narrative.Here you go, this is for you:http://vimeo.com/13704095Thanks for that! I hadn’t seen it and it was worth scrolling down through the vitriol.Just to be clear: calling someone else’s views “horrible nonsense” is not civil discourse. This should be a place for constructive conversation.Also in the cause of clarity: I did not say that the Sagan quote is a defense of theism.And yet the quote stands in the middle of an argument over whether or not Cosmos 2014 did justice to theism in the first episode.In particular, we have Jerry, who agrees that Cosmos missed a chance to build bridges. If science is compatible with theism, he may have a point. But science is NOT compatible with theism!Jerry grants evolutionary science, but this doesn’t mean his mind is at peace with both science and theism. He’s managed to evict theism from his belief in the origin of species. If he keeps learning more and more science, there will be less and less room for theism.This is why theists fear science, and why Bruno was burnt at the stake.Near as we can tell, Bruno was burned primarily for denying the divinity of Jesus and Church doctrine on salvation.And Sagan most definitely did believe in building bridges. He had zero room for mystical nonsense–but he very much wanted to make it clear that empiricism was not the enemy of spiritualism.You’ve sneakily changed the subject. You write of empiricism and spiritualism, when neither of those isms are the isms I’m talking about.I said *theism* (the belief) is incompatible with *science* (the process) in the mind of a person. Bruno is the right hero for Cosmos not only because he exemplifies this inherent conflict, but also because he was the first person since antiquity to call the stars other suns! No matter how he arrived at it, this is a fantastic idea!You attempt to claim Sagan as a fellow religious apologist. He wasn’t. He found in science a similar emotional joy that others derive from their faith. If that’s what you mean by spiritualism, then fine.That’s got nothing to do with the inherent conflict between science and theism, much less the heroism of Giordano Bruno.Who is claiming Sagan as a religious apologist, and who is saying that I am one? I quoted Sagan on spirituality–his word, not mine–and suggested that the quote had something for both sides to consider. The responses here illustrate the delicacy of the task Sagan was attempting.But back to the subject at hand. Bruno was not executed for believing other stars are suns (at least not primarily); his personal cosmic beliefs, innovative as they were, were not integrated into a sophisticated Copernican worldview; he was not the first to suggest that stars are other suns (that was Nicolas of Cusa, a century earlier); and he was not the first to consider an infinite expanse of stars (that was Thomas Digges).And Nicholas of Cusa was made a cardinal of the Church, which should indicate that the concern did not center on cosmology per se, but rather on the religious uses some people made of it.How is beleif that a god or gods exist incompatibl with the Proccess of Science?Sagan would be appalled at the way an entire wing of American politics is denying the findings of the entire scientific community on religious grounds.That might come as a surprise to the Jesuits who run some of the most distinguished universities in the world, Georgetown for one. Painting with such a broad kindergarten brush is a mark of a lazy mind.Let’s not forget that the Jesuits pretty much invented modern seismology.Science is not incompatible with the concept of a creator.  If you would like to eliminate the possibility entirely using the scientific method, we’re all ears. Please don’t respond by reduction to the absurd either like “well we can’t disprove a bunny rabbit crapped us into existence either”.  Conceptually, entertaining a creator of vast intelligence is valid. Claiming any certainty about it’s existence without evidence is absurd. The point being asserted by Neil deGrasse Tyson is that the scale and complexity of the universe should make any idea of a creator even more grand to entertain. Anyone who resorts to call any and all theists absurd is him or herself a bigot.I am not Morva Adam. Please give me credit for having not called all theists (people!) absurd. I do not think it, and I would not say it.You’re sound like you’re talking about deism, not theism. I hate philosophical hair-splitting, but theism is the belief in a personal god that intervene with the universe.As it happens, I do not exclude all deism in the sense that our world might be a simulation or envelope of spacetime intentionally inflated by an intelligent being. These are two natural explanations for our world that include a sort of creator, which I’ll allow to be called soft deism.This is not the creator that theists believe in. You cannot compare these scientific ideas to the magical idea of a supernatural creator who exists outside time and created the entire universe.My silly ideas of soft deism are not supernatural, and do not suffer from the problem of infinite regress which does, in fact, *entirely* eliminate the possibility of the theist’s creator.Theism is not the beelif in an active personal god that intervenes int he Universe. Theism is the beelfi that a god exists. Deism is a kind of Theism. I knwo rhis beause, unliek you, I’ve formally studied Relgiions in University, and am getign a doctorate in Theology as well as Psychology. (Cracks abtu my spellign I expect, I am dyslexic though so…)If you cant’ even get that right then of what use isyoru arugment?I know that it’s popular to make a distinction ebtween Deism and theism, but I also knwo hy, its because so many Enlighrenemtn Era heroes tot he Ne Atheists were Deists. Modern Militant Ateism wants to depict Theism as itself inherantly wrong and evil, but also wants men liek Thomas Pine to be on thir side, so they fabricated the idea that Deism and thesim are distinct. In reality Deism is a kind of Theism.its liek hwo many modern Athiest redefine Ateism as “Lakcof beelfi in a god” rahter han a a beelif so they can make it immune from Critisism.That said, an Active, ingerventionist God is not incompatible with Science as far as I can tell. I see no rason why in our Modern Sicnetific Undestnign you can’t also accept the possibilit of a personal and active creator, other han you not wanign it to be so..Actually, yes, theism *is* the belief in an active, personal god, says the dictionary. https://www.google.com/#q=define:theismSiphons work by a difference in Atmosphiric Pressure. Thus Saith the Dictionary.http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/may/10/dictionary-definition-siphon-wrongI’m sorry but, you’r overreliance on Gogole’s Dictioanry is getting old. Dctionaries seem to be like the Biel to you, the Innerant word of the Universe that can never be mistaken.By the way, thnere are more dictionaries out there, and most don’t define Theism as belefi in an active, personal god. THogh you’d think Mirriam Websters did ebcause it says beelfi in a god, especially a personal one, and sicne it says especially a personal one this emans a personal god is intrinsict to the definition, because the word Especially will be ignored.Theism means youbeelive a god exists, it does not mean you beleive in a personal god.I do’t cafe what google said. Google is wrong.Why is Science not compaticble with Theism?Just declarign its not is not really impressive. I can say Sxience is incompatible with Atheism, and it’d mean nothing. Just liek you’re claim emans nothing.Too many Scientists, including promenant ones liek Francis Collins, are Theists for me to accept the notion that Science is incompatibel with Theism.Let me guess – you probably believe disagreeing with someone’s views is “bullying” them.You also calld God a Skydaddy, a ridiculous insult invented by Richard Dawkins that’s used to make beleif in God seem silly but that in the end is innaccurate. Christians do not beeliv ein a magical sky daddy.The truth is, calling Christianity, or any other beelfi other than absolute Atheism, absurd is just baed on a Relgiiosu Dogma itself, an frankly the idea that only an Atheist can eb Rational and all “ReligioN’ is aburd nonsense because its Religion has become this unwuesitoend dogmatism itself, a Dogma that’s justa s blindign to its adherants and just as wrong.Peopel can disagree while stllrespectign others views, but if you’re goign to proclaim that tohers ae simply wrong becaue they are wrong, and then mock them baed on innacurate caricatures and misrepresenatiosn of their beleifs, then it’s really not beneficial.Sagan is referring to spiritual feelings of awe and humility, not belief in the supernatural. At issue is whether a science show should build a bridge from science into the realm of the supernatural. It should not. If you want to adopt science, you must first reject anti-science. There’s no other road to build.Two questions then emerge to me.1: Is Relgiion relaly just about the Supernatural? I’d say its not. Religion is really just another term for Philosophy, with the modern claim that Philosophy is distinct from Relgion just a concient.2: Is beleif int he Supernatural itself Anti-Science? Really, its not. You can beelive in both, and if the Supernatural exists, it also can evntually be discovered and studied.I fidn it droll to limit Science to the Mateial world and just as dogmatic to insist that it is, and that Relgion is beleiv in the Supernatural, and that the Supernatural does not exist and that your Anti-Science fo beleivign in it.These questions amount to nothing more than playing silly games with the definitions of words.1. According to the dictionary, this is untrue. If you can name a religion that involves philosophy but not prayer, at least one supernatural god, and an institution of practitioners, then what you’ve named is no religion at all.2. Again, no, that’s not what the word means. https://www.google.com/#q=define:supernaturalActually, there are more Definitins tot he word Relgiion than the one you foudn on Google, and they don’t all say belefi in the Sueprmnatural or in a go d is required. Relign on a single Dictionadry and demandign a signle definition is theonly one ever is itself rather silly.Just because Gogle defines Relgiion as beelfi in and revernece of gods and supernatural pwoers doens’t mean this is the sole, exclusive Truth we al have to obey. Google is not Infallible. Why not look up Relgiion in the Encyclopedia Brtannica? It cotnradicts Google. Why is Gogle better than Brtannica?For thatmatter, why is Google better than proffessional Anthrolologusts liek Pascal Boyer? Or proffessional Theologians like Stark?Gogled is not the end all be all of the terms meaning.1. Religion is not just another term for philosophy. I think you’re confusing with a personal philosophy, which can be seen as a replacement for religion.2. It depends on what you call supernatural, but I think there’s no definition under which belief in the supernatural could be called anti-science.1: Religion and personal Philosophy are the same thing, and if you can replace Religion with Personal Philosophy you prove its the same thing. If a Personal philosophy serves the same function as Relogion does, then its not different from Religion. I know a lot of peopel want there to be a distinction, but theres not. The divide is puely a culturlaly created construct, and in the end Relgion and Philosophy are the same thing.2: We agreed here.Personal philosophy is, but what’s usually called a personal philosophy has little to do with philosophy. I think you’re using a metonymy to refer to very different concepts.Philosophy is very different from religion, in purpose, scope, and methods.Religion has no “Mehod”, and the scope of Religion is everything, which is the same scope of Philosophy.Philosophy is an attemot to understand the world aroudn us, from Moralty, to where we came from, to how we shoudl live, to how peopel work, to the meanign of Life, and is not bound to any single topic or area. Well, the same is True of Religion. Religion is not limited to beleif in a god or to supernatural consiederations. If you look at Judaism, foe example, the Law of Moses deals in Moral and Ethical issues, as wellas National policy, and covers everythign from practical laws about food regulation and quality of clothing, to worhsip of God.it’s clearly not limited.Look at Christianity. Is Christianity all abotu Theology alone? The Sermon On The Mound refutes this on its own as it gives a list of moral and ethical situations,a nd most odf Jesus’s Teachings revovle aroudn how we treat one another and how we udnerstand one another rather rhan on simoly discussions about God and his Nature. So, I’d argue that the scope of Religion is identical tot he scope of Philosophy. And both rely ultimatley ion peopel rhinkign about the issues they see before them in the world they live in and tryign to find resolution to questiosn abotu who we are, whee we came from, what our uktimate purpose is, and how best to live.In what way then do they differ in scope or in Method?As for Purpose, the Ourpiose of Religion is to unerstand the world we liv ein, and hte urpose of Philosophy is to understand the world we liv ein. I again see no disrinction.Religion is, again, not all about bleif in gods.So in what way do they Truly differ?OK. Forget it.Except the “supernatural” is not necessarily “anti-science”. Science can only ever explain what we can perceive with our senses. We can’t say whether the logic of the scientific method applies outside of that perception, so you can’t use rationality to claim what exists or not outside the realm of our perception. What is non-science doesn’t have to be anti-science. Science and non-science can go in pair, the problem is both sides are too often extremists in their belief.You’re right the *idea* of the supernatural is non-science rather than anti-science. However, belief in the supernatural is an *act* of anti-science.Which are these two sides so often extremist in their beliefs?Those who disregard science because its findings doesn’t match their beliefs, and those who disregard everything that is not scienceExtremism sure sounds like a bad thing. I’m not sure what you mean by disregarding everything that’s not science. Disregard means ignore, pay not attention to. I think scientists get into conflict with theists when they pay attention to that theism, and its consequences. I don’t think that’s extreme. I think that it’s reasonable to question *all* beliefs, religious or otherwise.Disregard also means “to treat as unworthy of consideration or respect”. What I’m getting at is that many so-called scientists have the belief that only science can bring answers, and that anything outside the scope of science is unworthy of consideration. The belief in a god, in other planes of existences, in an afterlife for instance.Science deals with observations acquired from sensory perception, and it seems to me that our logic itself arises from sensory experience, so anything outside such experiences may be outside the scope of science and logic, but that doesn’t mean we can gain no knowledge without applying the scientific method and our classical logic. There might be other planes of existence, science cannot say, but we may find an answer through other means outside of sensory perception and logic. Since all we can perceive with our senses boils down to electrical signals in our brain, and since our logic seems to derive from sensory experience, then when you think that these electrical signals could be simulated in the first place, you realize that what we can observe with our senses and deduce from them through the scientific method may be a tiny part of the whole picture.What’s your point, exactly? That science may never answer every single question? What does that have to do with supernatural beliefs being anti-science? What does it have to do with a missed chance for “building bridges”, as Jerry Asbridge put it?many so-called scientists have the belief that only science can bring answers, and that anything outside the scope of science is unworthy of consideration.Quite right.The belief in a god, in other planes of existences, in an afterlife for instance.If those things exist it only makes sense to believe in them once that existence is proved.  There may be secrets of the universe we can never unravel, but it’s foolish to just assume that things like the existence of an afterlife would be among them, or the existence of God, etc.  Knowledge of how things work is only gained through science.>If those things exist it only makes sense to believe in them once that existence is proved
>Knowledge of how things work is only gained through science.Because you assume that this is the case. You cannot prove using the scientific method that science is the sole or the best way to acquire knowledge. It works pretty well to describe and make predictions about what we perceive, but that’s it. Every logical and scientific reasoning is based on axioms that by definition you cannot prove, and you cannot prove that these axioms are the ones that allow you to gain all or even most knowledge that can be acquired. We use these axioms because they appear self-evident or reasonable to our brains, because our brain processes information in a way as to make them appear self-evident, but an alien brain might conceptualize things in a totally different way to ours. It is narrow-minded to affirm that science and logic are the only way to acquire knowledge. The current paradigm is to believe that this is the case (because indeed that is a belief), but eventually that will change.Obviously, we can trust those scientific axioms because otherwise the technology based on them would not work.  Science can’t be narrow minded.  First, science is a way of thinking, not a thing in itself, and it’s a process that is open to change as new evidence is acquired.Science explains a lot more than just what we can perceive, as Dr. Tyson points out early on.  If we were limited to only what we can perceive we wouldn’t have got very far.  The supernatural doesn’t exist, though.  It can’t.  There’s only the known and the unknown.Instruments such as an infrared telescope make you perceive things that you would not perceive otherwise, you perceive the output of these instruments, so indeed science helps explain things that we can perceive (directly or indirectly through these instruments). What else could it explain?Regarding the supernatural, if we use the definition from the Merriam-Webster dictionary: “unable to be explained by science or the laws of nature”, then your very perception of the world is supernatural, because science does not explain how sensory perception can arise from physical processes, from interactions between particles.supernatural – (of a manifestation or event) attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature:  a supernatural being.From the OED.Instruments such as an infrared telescope make you perceive things that you would not perceive otherwise, you perceive the output of these instruments, so indeed science helps explain things that we can perceive (directly or indirectly through these instruments). What else could it explain?Quite obviously we cannot perceive those things unaided, which was my point.science does not explain how sensory perception can arise from physical processesScience has done exactly that.  We know how vision works.  How hearing works.  Touch.  Taste.  This is all known.The adopting of science doesn’t require going out of your way to denigrate religion.  You don’t have to “build a bridge,” but you also don’t have to wield torches.  Saying NOTHING about religion seems the better bet when trying to promote science, does it not?  Science should be its own light, and stand on its own.  It doesn’t need to crush anything else in order to do that.  You do not need to be actively anti-religious to be pro-science.  Hostility really has no place in science.Who went out of their way to denigrate religion? Certainly, not the writers of Cosmos 2014.Let’s not forget that the Roman Inquisition were the ones literally wielding torches! It happens to be a *supremacist* argument to equate depicting this horrible act with painting religion in a bad light.The first episode of Cosmos has EVERYTHING to do with the beginning of our understanding of what, exactly, is the Cosmos! The idea that all the stars in the sky are other suns with other worlds is the most grand way I can think to begin the series.“Who went out of their way to denigrate religion? Certainly, not the writers of Cosmos 2014.”Certainly, they did.  And let’s be honest — the hostility they’ve shown to religion in other venues grants them no benefit of the doubt on the subject.  Nor does the implication that Bruno was tortured with devices which didn’t even exist at the time.Bruno was not a good example of the point they were ostensibly trying to make.  I suspect they chose him because they got to close off the story with a burning at the stake, something they would get to do with Galileo, Kepler, or anyone else who was an actual scientist of the same time, espousing theories contrary to the Church, yet who lived long lives and died peacefully in their own beds, un-immolated.What does “supremacist argument” even mean?  What’s supposedly “supreme,” and where do you take me as arguing for it?Not that I even “equated” any such thing. It’s funny how you can read in what you want to see, and entirely ignore that which you don’t.Yes, you’re right, the images of torture devices was way over the top. But those cutaways meant to bring attention to the (historically factual) barbarity of the inquisition at the time. I didn’t see it as a statement on religions per se. Yes, you can read in what you want to see. But don’t mistake that subjective opinion for objective fact.Which claim or image from the show was denigrating to religion per se? Who has shown hostility to religion in other venues? It’s not clear who you mean. Seth? Neil? Ann? Atheists? Fox?We can agree to disagree as to why they chose Bruno, and that whether or not it was a good choice.Your argument is supremacist because it subtly relies on the belief that one particular culture (the Christian faith) is superior to all others.Consider these hypothetical examples:A racist claims denigrates whites to show pictures of lynched blacks.
An anti-Semite claim it denigrates her to show pictures of the holocaust.
A male chauvinist claims it denigrates him to talk about rape prevention.
A heterosexual claims it denigrates traditional marriage to allow gay marriage.It is similarly supremacist for a theist to claim it denigrates religion to show pictures of a man burnt at the stake by the Roman Inquisition.My “argument” relies on nothing about religion, period.  I didn’t even mention Christianity, let alone say it was superior.  My argument is entirely about the content of Cosmos.  Indeed, you ARE reading into things exactly what you want to see.And the “reasoning” you present — “a racist claims,” etc., is preposterously silly.I’m not gay, yet I speak up for marriage equality.  By your sad attempt at “reasoning,” I would have to be gay to do so.You can keep shluffing it off all you want, but it isn’t just the depiction of burning at the stake; it’s the context of the entire thing.  Context is everything.  Do you deny this?And elsewhere (maybe even here; I haven’t read all the comments), there are other atheists who have no problem seeing the religion-bashing and *applaud* it openly.I completely agree with the civility part, this isn’t world net daily.If they were interested in winning over the Religious Right, they wouldn’t have let the President they think is a Muslim introduce the show.Nixon’s famous phone call to the Apollo 11 astronauts got much more play than this.  It’s not unusual for the sitting president to play some small role in such things.Of course it’s not unusual.  That won’t stop religious conservatives, especially those who question the president’s religion and place of birth, from criticizing the show.The nation is far more embedded in the partisanship of Washington than it once was.Give it rest.When they give it a rest, then I will.Are you 12? What a childish response.I disagree.“As long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality persist in our world, none of us can truly rest.”  – Nelson MandelaBy believing in evolution your god is reduced to an incompetent bungler.  If He existed he wouldn’t need to go through that whole, inefficient song and dance, He would have created us how he wanted in the first place.  Face it, religion and science are incompatible.I hope the rest of the episodes are better. The first was pretty good for kids or if you or have a very limited education in science. But I thought it was kind of thin gruel compared to many of the things I’ve seen on PBS, or the original Cosmos as I remember it. They could have gone easier on the cartoonish “religion BAD, science GOOD” stuff also. But at least Seth didn’t tell the story with the Family Guy characters.I really recommend going back an (re)watching the original Sagan version. The first episode uses a lot of the same dialogue and examples, but the tone is drastically different–more urgent, more personal, more optimistic.I will. I haven’t seen it since then and I’m sure my current impression of the original will be a lot different from my nostalgic memory of it.Great post, Mr. Powell! Agreed that Bruno, though well-known, was not necessarily the best lens through which to tell the story they wanted to tell– and that the Digges story would have been better. Hopefully they do better with Pythagoras and some of the other Sagan stories. But there was much to approve of in the new series opener, and I for one look forward to watching with my son.Thank you. I agree, and admire much of what the new Cosmos team is attempting to do. But this was one area where I felt like they missed an important opportunity, and where I could add something meaningful to their story.It was plenty meaningful to an atheist like me.Of coruse it was. So is the story of how th Enlgthenment ended the Age of Faith and bruth usinto Reason, which also liberated men with freedom and brouth us unparralleleled Progress. The wuestion si not wha is meangineful to you, ut hat is True. The fact htat you ignore Historical Reality anduse Episodes fromt h past as nohign mroe than mraliry plays to advoate yoru own Religion-thats-not-a-Religion is theonly Reason these thigns are menaignful, a hey personify and embody the ideals and narratives you prefer to think in.I haven’t ignored any historical realities! I’ve learned a lot, and am grateful to Corey for his blog post, and some others (yourself firmly excluded, I’m sorry to say) in the comments.Quite the contrary, I’m very open to hearing other people’s ideas and narratives. I’ve tried very hard to read and understand yours, and am thoroughly disappointed. You keep attacking me and building straw men out of my arguments. You tell me that my idea of religion is wrong. Fine, what is religion, to you, then?Tell ing me thay I am firmly excluded is rather CHildish. It reinformces my overall point that you’re bein rude and unfair.I doubt you’velearedn much formt he psoershere so much asyou nolw want ot garner some kind of High Road for yourself in contrast to me sicne yoru tlakign to me.I really hate it when peoeol use this kind of language as its always a ploy.Religion is nothign moe than the belifs one holds to that explains the Reality they see. Man didnt stat with no Relgiion then invent Relgiion, the very moment Huamnity, or even a Pre-Human Ancestor, attained conscious awareness and tried to make sense of their world “Relgiion” was created. Religion is notign more than our explanations of how things got here, and the suppsoed distinction ebtwen Reglin and Sicnece, how they arrove at answers, dosn’t even exist sicne there is no Relgious Method all Relgiiosn use to come up with Answrs.To me, Evolution and Big Bang are as much Creation Narratives, Myths in the academic sense ( Not stories that arento True so much as explanative stories that explain who we are or where we came from or soem other higher Truth) as is Yougn Earth Crwationism. WHile I am not reducing them to the same level as youmay think, from a ourely Psychological standpoint, they are about the same tings and serve the same opurpose. They tell us where our world came from and how we got here. Religion is nohign ore than the framework we use to undertand ourselves and how to live. In a sence, I agree withthe works of Pascal Boyer who was an infleucne on my own Research, he was an Anthroologist who said Relgiion did not exist, only CUlture. To me, Relgiion both doesnt exist and does. There is no oen signle thign called Relgiion, its jst a bklnket term like “Govenrment”, that has no meanign in itself. In the end, it bpils down to what you beleive abotu hwo thigns work.Certainly they could have pointed out that the Aristotelian universe was not small and cozy and the Earth was supposed as being in the bottom of the world as a place insignificance, not in the “center” as a place of honor. Further, the show could have explained that the Greeks, the Arabs, and the Medievals were not stoopid: there was sound empirical evidence for the geostationary model and against geomobility.
Galileo never did find evidence proving the Copernican model, although he did find one bit of evidence that the Ptolemaic model was wrong: the phases of Venus cannot be accounted for in Ptolemy, but are explicable in the the Copernican and the Tychonic and Ursine models.  These phases were noted at about the same time by Lembo, Galileo, Harriot, and Marius. (Lembo was teaching the phases at Lisbon before Galileo announced his discovery.) Astronomers dropped Ptolemy like a rock and flocked instead around the Tychonic and Ursine models — because there was still no evidence that the Earth moved.Complication: the actual Copernican model was wrong.And yet it moves.Witelo showed that motion was relative to the observer, so there is a slight complication. The point is that you can’t just proclaim it as a matter of faith. In science you have to demonstrate the claim with evidence — as Cosmos claimed. Up until the mid 1800s all the empirical evidence was against the dual motions of the earth. See here for discussion:http://thonyc.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/but-it-doesn%E2%80%99t-move/Anyone could have applied the ellipse to the motion of the celestial bodies at any time.The evidence was there, waiting to be seen.Actually, no. The evidence was actually not there “waiting to be seen.” The Alphonsine Tables had been corrupted over the centuries by copyist errors. That’s why the Copernicans’ Prussian Tables failed to make better predictions. They were simply new calculations on the old data. No way would anyone discover ellipses in that mish-mosh. It is doubtful that even the pristine data would have been precise enough to winkle out an ellipse, given the sorts of instruments then in use.Pristine, precise data, made with calibrated instruments, was needed; and that is where Tycho and his Uraniborg observatory came in. He spent years designing and calibrating instruments and then using them to make meticulous observations. He achieved precisions on the order of the diameter of a quarter seen from down the length of a football field. Based on the observed diameters of the stars, they could not be too far away — otherwise, they would be so enormous as to dwarf our entire solar system, and the Sun would have been the only pea in a universe of watermelons. Hence, the stars could not be much more that 100x the distance to Saturn.Given that — and the precision of Tycho’s data — stellar parallax should have been clearly visible if the Earth circled the sun. There was no visible parallax. Hence, the Earth did not circle the Sun, but was stationary.  So Tycho devised a modified Heracleidan model as the best model consistent with the available data.Because Copernicus’ solution to the Martian orbit was so badly screwed up, Tycho hired Kepler to work on it. But because he suspected the Imperial Mathematician, Reymers Baer (“Ursus”), of plagiarizing his data, Tycho would not allow Kepler to make copies of the data. He had to use them on-site. After Kepler succeeded Tycho (who had succeeded Baer) as Imperial Mathematician, he negotiated better access to the data. He tried Mars in the Ptolemaic model, the Copernican model, and the Tychonic model, but was dissatisfied with each. He gave up on uniform motion, and assumed that the planets sped up and slowed down (for some reason). Lo! This reduced the error to a few arc minutes. Well if the physicists were wrong about uniform motion, maybe they were also wrong about circular motion. He tried ovals, but wrote to David Fabricius that he did not know the geometrical method of generating an oval path. If only the orbit were a pure ellipse…So, what the heck. He tried it and it worked. It took him another 23 years to work out the Rodulphine Tables — and at one point he had to flee Linz on the approach of a peasant army intent of sacking the place.  Thirty Years War stuff. The tables came out in 1627. They predicted a transit of Mercury in Nov. 1631.  Gassendi spotted Mercury, but wasn’t sure. (It was smaller than he had thought it would be) So he didn’t announce this vindication of the Rudolphine Tables for a few years.  Galileo remained wedded to Platonic mysticism and insisted on the pure Platonic circles, even after Prince Cesi pointed out the elliptical solution. In his infamous “Dialogues” Galileo did not so much as mention the Keplerian model.In 1665, Riccioli applied ellipses to the Tychonic model; but by then the simplicity of the Rudolphine Tables had won the field, and the 1660s marks the acceptance of Kepler’s model over the Tychonic and Ursine models as at least the most useful math. (The two main physical falsifications were not dealt with for another hundred years.So basically Latin Christian mathematicians discovered ellipses about as soon as they could have possibly been discovered.You do know that Gallileo ddn’t actually saythis, Right?And yet it moves!So, basiclaly you nee o promote a Histortical Lie to advance yoruown Religous Dogma.Quite possibly this blogger is right. I think Bruno is a great character to talk about, but I’d be careful not to put him on too high of a pedestal. I think the story of Bruno as told in Cosmos is best interpreted as a cautionary tale about what happens in a society when there is no separation of church and state and when religious authorities have absolute power. He came across some truth about the universe more or less by luck but could offer no evidence, and that is not how scientific discovery works. A scientist doesn’t just have a dream and then declare that their dream is The Truth. But even if he had been 100% wrong, what these churches (Roman Catholic clearly, but also Calvinist and Lutheran) did to him was worse than wrong. It also reminds one of the current state of blasphemy laws in some Muslim countries. Different religion, but exact same problem.Well, sure, religious freedom is important, but this show is not about religious freedom, but about science, and the show pushed the same tired ‘Religion and Science DEATHMATCH!’ rhetoric that only burns bridges, and, as pointed out in the article, isn’t even TRUE.Better burnt bridges than burnt people.best response ever LOLReligion played a very serious role in keeping rational, scientific, humanistic thinking back. If history is to teach us anything, we should understand that dogmatic thinking, groupthink, conformism, submission to leaders and other things that make up the backbone of religions are destructive, are in our nature, and we should overcome them with education and understanding.That being said, I wasn’t entirely happy about the episode and how they portrayed things. While the portrayal of Bruno and his execution wasn’t entirely realistic, let’s not defend the religious people who killed a human beingfor not believing in their dumbass dogmas.Huh? Nobody here is saying the Catholic Church had a right to imprison and execute Bruno. My whole point is that Cosmos bought into a common misrepresentation of Bruno, casting him as a lone cosmological pioneer rather than as an oppressed iconoclastic theologian. But the punishment by the Church is evil either way.Corey, what changes would have satisfied you as a correct interpretation? Maybe at the podium, if he’d been accompanied by some followers? Maybe have him sleeping a supporter’s house instead of alone in the forest?The show’s assertion that Bruno was the “one man” whose ideas went beyond those of Copernicus is just not true, and despite some waffling the claim that Bruno’s cosmology was fundamentally physical rather than theological is also not true. The bits about his wealth and support are secondary to the issue of intellectual honesty.You misunderstood the line from Cosmos. “But for one man, Copernicus didn’t go far enough.” (~17:30 into the episode.) This introduces a character, but does not give Bruno undo credit.Bruno never lectured at Oxford, another historical inaccuracy of the show. He was denied permission by the faculty. It was this snub that drove him to write The Ash Wednesday Supper.

The translator’s comments are interesting because he held a PhD in physics.“Bruno who visited [Oxford] in the summer of 1583 and gave a series of lecturers on Copernicus’s theory that the Earth rotated round the fixed Sun.”http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bruno_Giordano.htmlMy reply was aimed at Topheh, and its second half was a mere reminder and warning.Why iwas he Punishment Evil?Aren’t you presumign to judge peopel in a different ra by modern standards?The Soviet union taught us that Blind obedience to Authority, ridgind Dogmatism, Humanism, Praisign Sicnece and Reason, and a desire for absolute ocnfirmity can be pushed by Atheists as well.The Real problem int Relgiion. The real probelm is hose who refuse to look at all the facs and make heir own desicsion.Yoru idea that alL Relgiion si Irraitonal and we’d be bettr off without it is just as Blidn, confrommist, and dogmatic as anythgin else.Another uneducated dude about urrs history, leaders in that empire were portrayed as gods aswell, and there was a religion of state, we would be better off without religion and thats for sure, though i wouldnt ban any religion at all, that just gives more power to religion and i wouldnt do that anyday, Id do what sweden did for exaample,Let religion fade slowly.The Soviet Union may have been called “The Evil Emoire” by Reagan, but they ere not formally an Empire at all, and the claim you just made about their leaders being portrayed as gods is rather a bit silly. The Soviet Union functioned along the official Doctrine of State Atheism. The official position was that there were no gods a sll, and the State spent a lot of Time and Money on puttign out Anti-Religion and Atheistic Propaganda.Please don’t cite the stupid Hitchens excuse. Hitchens claimed the Soviets were Religious but at that point it became apparent that “Religion” is just anythign Hitchens didn’t like. Basiclaly, any Time somethign evil comes up its “Religion”, but once you define it that way it makes all conversation meanignless. Why shoudl i see you as not havign sa Religion, and thus as the model of hat we shoudl all be like, and yet see the Soviets as Religious?Don’t you get how absurd that is?Burn bridges? why again?In the 17th century, religious authorities did not have absolute power. In most countries, they had been subordinated to the State; and each State enforced its Established Church because they equated heterodoxy with disloyalty.  (And in fact, the use of religion as a surrogate for political issues has a long history.)But look around and ask, who are the dogmatists who are suppressing contrary opinions today? It’s not a church-versus-secularism as presented in this myth, the modern players following the inquisitional/suppressive style inhabit different social structures. Just sayin’….Or hwo abou the State Atheism of the Soviet Union? Separation of Curch and STate is not a cure all, sicne the State can decide to be so Militantly Seculaist it activley eprscutes Religion. Given that I see the distinction ebtween Relgiion and Secualism as artificial to begin with, I think the Separation of Church and Ttae, or Relgiiona nd Sicnec eis just a Hindeance to actual Free Thought.Really, the problem isnot a Religiosu Orginisaion beign given unlimited Power. In fact, qhen Brino died the Chruch didnt have unlimited absolute Power. The problemis that all societies have beleifs yoru expected to follow that they enforce on us, and just callign them “Secualr” doesnt make much difference. The real question I have is, does Bruno actulaly represent a man persecuted for Science? And he doesnt.I don’t like the misrepresentation of Bruno.Nor do I think there’s any reason to attempt “brokering peace” between science and religion. Religion is anti-science by definition. It’s not compatible or comparable to science.Digges may have envisioned an infinite universe, but I thought the important idea, first had by Bruno, was that the stars are other suns!When I talk about “brokering peace” I am talking about a historical reality, not a theoretical goal. Digges took an approach that defused theological battles (made easier by being in Anglican England, to be sure) and helped open up widespread scientific conversations about the Copernican system. This was an important and constructive approach. It is more relevant to the story of astronomical progress than is Bruno’s heresies, which were grounded more in philosophy than in the early attempts at constructing a physically realistic model of the universe. Bruno’s ideas about the plurality of inhabited worlds were creative and strangely prescient. But as I noted, they were rooted in theology, not science as we now understand it, and even those ideas are present, in more limited form, in the writings of Nicolas of Cusa. Bruno was a disciple of Nicolas’s, so we know that he read those texts.There is no question that Bruno was a brilliant man, a devotee to the free discussion of ideas, a mystical visionary, and in some ways a scientific one as well. My objection is that he was not the simple, solitary explorer of the infinite depicted in this episode of Cosmos.Right. In order to make the story more compelling, they use the hero myth of Joseph Campbell. They show him as a solitary explorer sleeping outside alone. He flies around in his dream like Jesus.But didn’t they give credit to Lucretius for his idea of infinite space? Maybe they could have mentioned Digges, that would have been fine. I don’t think an episode about Digges would have been as inspiring or fun.I also don’t agree that Cosmos should commit time to the historical reality of peace brokered between religion and science, or be limited to the most relevant characters in the story of astronomical progress.I think its poignant to show a little bit of how bad were the times before the enlightenment and the birth of modern science. This show is targeted at people who don’t necessarily know about it.to Phsyics Inquisitor: And in modern times, therefore,  in countries that suppressed religion, we saw such a flowering of free thought and unfettered scientific progress that… uh, wait.  Attack of cognitive dissonance looming. Uh…

LYSENKO
There, Back on track. I got to see the ultimate in the intellectual liberty of religion-free societies when I recently spent a few weeks in North Korea. No burning at stakes THERE!You have just showed ur utter ignorance to all of us with that north korea statement, in North Korea, leaders are depicted as demigods ,and doers of supernatural magic tricks ,just as Jesus was. That do not seem like a religion free society for me buddy, You would like to take a look at palces like sweden or switzerland  where religions are almost entirely dismissed by the general public, and they seem to be doing very well( also in science fields LARGE Hadron Collider anyone?)The ad hominem in calling me an “inquisitor” is the least damning fallacy you present. It does not follow from the fact that some secular societies were bad that religion is good. Suppressing religious freedom is obviously bad, in and of itself! That’s the theme of the entire segment on Bruno!My argument is that “brokering peace” sounds like religious apology. Religious apology is bad, because it attempts to compromise principles that I’d rather not compromise. That’s NOT the same as suppressing religions. Rather, it’s not allowing *science* to be suppressed by religions!Turns out Corey wasn’t making religious apology, he was talking about historical fact. I misread that one sentence. Silly me.Hope you’re in jail getting raped everyday like you deserve child rapist.I think the real problem you have here is that you want to depict Relgiion as inherantly Hotiel to Science, ebcaise yoru “Philospphy thats not a Relgiion” says os.You defned COsmos less because you think its accurate, and mroe because the interpretation of History and the Historical Mythology about the Dark ges of Christaintiy holdign us back beign cshttered byt he WOnderful Enlightenemtn defines hwo you udnerstand the debate. Its liek whe I tell Americans that King George wasn’t actually a Tyrant and a lot of the thigns in the Declaration Of Indeoendance are polemic and Unfair. Most just don’t accept this because the whoel Idea of King George as a tTyrant and Monarhcy as Evil as oppsoed to a Republic as Freedom is intrinsic in their identieis, so much so ghat they think Monarhcy must be DIctatorhsip and use “King”as an insult.The Actual Hisotry is irrelevant. You use the Hisoy to embody the ideas of a conflict between Sicnece and Relgiion. The fa tthat he Enlightenemtn saw loads of popel slaughteed for Thoughtcrimes, and that the Reign of Terror in France was a diect resutl fo it means nothing. To you, its the Dark, Vilet, oppresiv Dark Ages of Relgiion holdung us back, and the ownderful redom Ratioanlity gacve us in the Enlightenemnt. You simpky refuse to see anythign else.I think the real problem here is your typing. I honestly can’t be sure what you’re trying to say.Cosmos did a good job at sparking a conversation. I learned something from Corey about Diggs, which is great. There’s also a wave of religious supremacy, where some people feel victimized at seeing focus drawn to the church’s victims, namely Bruno.You’re the one seems to refuse to see anything other than a myopic war between science and religion.I;m DYslexic. As for COsmis doign a good job at Sparkign a COnversation, woudl yo have said the same thign if it advocated Rael, the founer fothe Raelian Relgiion (WHich does not ebelive iN Supernatural gods yet is still a Relgiion, Midn you) as a downtrodden outcast who nobly pursued Truth?Misrepresentign Histgory by castign Bruno as a sympathetic, Kndly man who just sought Scientific Truth andwho was beaten down by the Church isn’t dign a good job at Sparkign COnversation, it’s simply reinforcign he idea that the CHruch held back Science and Progress and castign those who challenged it in a Heroic Light, which fits the idea that Science and Relgiion are cotnrary forces. That’s also why you like the swgments and appriciate them.What I see is the distortion of Historu to promote an Idea, so stop tryign to shift the blame to me.“Religion is anti-science by definition.”?!  That’s abject nonsense.  Allow me to list a few scientists you might have heard of, who were also devout Christians, and whose scientific research and philosophy was driven significantly by their faith in God and their Christian world-view:  Copernicus.  Galileo.  Kepler.  Newton.  Mendel.  Pasteur.  Faraday.  Maxwell.
There are many more who would at a minimum find your statement to be nonsense.  Planck.  Heisenberg.  Even Einstein.
Physics Police?  You should read at least one book by Polkinghorne, who studied under P.A.M. Dirac and who authored “A Very Short Introduction to Quantum Physics.”  Or perhaps your PhD in Physics is from a better qualified University than his.I didn’t say “religious people” I said “religion”.Yes, you made a claim about religion and science, a claim that you think is TRUE, but a who’s-who of the greatest scientific minds ever thought was FALSE.  Now are you understanding the argument?thats cause u people do not think in context, science has been taking distance from religion as it progressed in time. You people do not know to think in context, so i do not think u would ever get it“you people”?  I’m a degreed Engineer who started out as a Physics Major.  My father was a professor of Physics who did his undergraduate work at MIT and his PhD at the University of Washington.Since you suppose yourself educated on the “context,” how much have you read (in their own words) about the REASONS that Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, etc. were devout Christians, while being among the greatest Physicists ever?  None?  Of course not–you wouldn’t want your “context” spoiled by learning a fact or two.And how many of John Polkinghorne’s books have you read?  None?  Wow.  I should have so much respect for your insights into “context.”  I have read all of the above, and because of the deep ignorance of your comment I can tell that you have not.  Pat yourself on the back for spouting ignorance in the name of science.I’m not understanding you, no. Lots of great scientists held lots of false beliefs. So what?You call yourself the “Physics Police,” but you do not understand the history of Physics, nor do you have the least clue about the thought processes of most of the Physicists who invented Physics itself.  So, being yourself entirely ignorant of their thoughts on these matters, you label those thoughts “false beliefs.”  Yet it is those very beliefs that made them great scientists.  They believed that there is a rational God who wrote the laws by which the universe runs, and as such those laws, being rational, were discoverable by rational beings.  Also, they believed that Time is linear, a belief historically held by Jews and Christians alone in the world–every other culture we’ve ever studied thought of Time as circular.  All of Physics is predicated upon an understanding of Time that is linear.Also, your statement is ridiculous in another way.  How could the entire development of Physics be done exclusively by Christians (or at a minimum Deists) for three centuries of great advancement, if Christianity and Physics were fundamentally incompatible?  It’s like positing that every great military leader from Alexander to Pershing universally held beliefs that are known to be incompatible with warfare.  That is irrational.  Their beliefs and thoughts had to be compatible with warfare, or else they could not have become the greatest military leaders in history.e.g. Newton: “Atheism is so senseless & odious to mankind that it never had many professors.”You also made ti as if tis a fact wthotu rlaly givign a Reaosn for it. Relgiion is not Anti-Science by definition. It sjust Anti-Sicence to soemone who buys intot he old Conflcit Thesis.Not at all, religion is really anti science by definition, i rest my caseYou know something, I keep hearign how Religion is Anti-Science by definition fom you lot, but I never encounter an actual defiition of Religion that says this. Relgiion is nto Anti-Scince by Defiition, all Religion is is a set of beelifs about he nature of our existence, and is really somehign evn the Anti-Religiosu liek you have. Religion is beelifs, and Religion is not and cannot be in itself Anti-Science.https://www.google.com/#q=define:religionHeres a link for you. Keep in mind Google uses the Oxford English Dictionaey.http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/may/10/dictionary-definition-siphon-wrongI’m not sayign the OED is completley worshless but, to assume the singular definition you foudn on Google is the absoluite definition of Relgiion once and for all Tiem and that it is completley infallible is just stupid.The Encyclopedia Britannica makes mention of Huamnistic and Naturlaisgic Relgiions in its article on Relgiion, but that;s not a valid soruce, and in my 15 Years of formal study of Relgiion, even (Agnostic sicne that meanshe isnt a Christain apologit) Pascal Boyer noted that he came tot eh conclusion that Religion didn’t exist, only Culture and there was no thign called Relgiion.The Stanford Encyclopedia Of Philosoohy also says the term Relgiion is difficult to pin down and has no absilute meaning.But hey, you foudn the definition on Google so we all have to bow down to it withotu Question, Right?Religions contain worship of a “supernatural”
 god. Belief in the supernatural is anti-science.Really that’s a circular argument, if you trace it to its source.  Natural Philosophy, as defined by Newton, was not materialistic.  And even in the current, dumbed-down “matter is all there is” redefinition of science, you hear discussions of branching realities and multiverses–things that are by definition inaccessible to physical observation.So, on the trivial level (If you re-define science as limited to the physically observable, then non-observable things are incompatible with science) your reasoning is circular.  But on the substantive level, even modern science is chock full of things that are physically non-observable, and therefore supernatural in any meaningful sense.But your first sentence is exactly right, for any religion worth its salt!Your wrogn on both counrts. Beleif int eh Supernatural is not Anti-Science and there’s no Logical reaosn tot hink thatg if soemone beleives in the Sueoprnatural he is Anti-Science, and Relgiion doens’t require the worship of a Supernatural god. Threvada Buddhism doens’t worhsip any gods, and yet is classified as a Relgiion, and many forms of Confusianism don’t worship any god. FOr that matter, Ancien pagans didn’t wrship supernatural gods. Yes thy worshipped gods, but their gods were the Spirits of Natural forces, not distinct from Nature.In facrt, even modern Christuanity isn’t restricted to a supernatural god as many Theologians have come up with the beleif in a Natural god.I’m sorry you’r so ignroant of the study of Relgiion, and desparately need to create a distinctiin betweenyour “Rationl and Sicneticif” beleifs and Relgiion, but your fundamentlaly flawed approach won’t sustain your claims.You’re re-defining terms again. The Christian god is, by definition, supernatural. You can read all about him in that book, what do they call it? Bib-ell? Bee-ball? I forget.I’m pretty sure the Christian god listens to and sometimes answers people’s prayers. If you take that power away from him, and take other supernatural powers away, too, what’s left?What is a natural god? I think it’s just nature. The study of nature is called science, not religion.I idnt redefien terms though, evertgin I’ve said has been said before by others. The real problem is, your efuse to see past thelence of yoruown Religion and accept whatever proves yoruposition without lookign at cotnrary information.Just usign Google doesnt give you the absolute dfinitive meanings of words.Your also wrong. The Christain God is not by definition Supernatural. If this were True, then how do you explain the Christian Theology of Paul Tillich who envisioned God as the Ground Of Beign raher han as a separate Supernaual Entity? Or ChristianPantheists who followed the lead of (Jewish) Spinoza? I’m sorry you arent well vrsed in History or Theology but, plenty of Theologians have postulated God as natural as oppsoed to Supernatural, and the claim tha od must be Supernatural in Christainity is just you trying to force thigns to fit oru mould.By the way, the Bible never mentions the term “Supernatural”.And please stop beign childish. We all know your “Atheism” is shallow and you relaly just lie mockign Christianity butsayign you forgot the name of “his book’ and calling it things liek the Bi-bell is just childish.By the way, the ability to lsiten to and answer prayers is not nessisarily Supernatural either. Do you even knwo what the term Supernatural means?Actually, the real problem is you’re using esoteric definitions of words. You may be using them correctly in the context of some technical, theological discussion. But as you say, I’m not privy to this discussion. I’ve not studied theology. I studied computer science.I don’t know anything about Paul Tillich, but it sounds like he was talking a bunch of nonsense.Of course the Bible doesn’t have the word “supernatural” in it. Neither does it have the word “electromagnetic”. These are both concepts that exist today, but not when it was written. This illustrates my point that religion is at best unhelpful in science, and at worst, a hindrance.Listening to prayers is a supernatural act of mind reading, and answering them is the supernatural act of using magic. You can play this  word-definition game all you want, it doesn’t change the fact that supernatural stuff doesn’t happen and isn’t real. It’s a mistaken way of thinking about the world, that’s all.Youre trign to condemn all Relgiion as unhelopful, even a hinderanxe, to Science, and yet you want to claim you aren’t prvy to the discussion on how peoepl sue terms and what they mean? or what peoeplbeleive? I’m sorry but, you’ve just lost the plot. You can’t pove that Relgiion is a hinderane to Science if you don’t even know what Religion is or what actual Religious peopel think. Deinign words for them and tellign them what theybeelive then sayign they are wrong is just stupidity.I’m not tryign to be mean here but, relaly you just said Paul Tillich spoke a bunch of Nonsense after admittign to not knowign anythign abotu him. This is the equivolent o me usign the popualr Evolution trope to say “I don’t knwo anythign abotu Darwin but it soudns liek he said a bunch of Nonsense”. Does that fly with you? or does itonly work with “Relgiion”?Ignorance is acceptable as we are all ignroant on sime things, but to condemn somethign out of ignroance is just irrational.By the way, saign that the Bible not mentionign Supernatual or Electromagntic illustrates yoru poitn that Relion is unheloful to Sicnece is alsostupid. I have a Phsics book that faisl to mention Associative conscousness, which is a concept in the Science I use, Psychology, so I can conclude that Physics is not a real Science. Or i can say newton has no relevance today sicne he makes no mention of Reletivity and is unhelpful. Yoru comment on how the Bible is unhelpful becaue itdoesnt menionconcepts we have today is absolutely preposterous.By the way, Machio Kaku, a Physisit, says we may one day build machins that let us read Minds. If humans can do it usign the laws of nrue, why is it a Supernatural asct for God to?That’s the real problem with you, you’ve demarcated lines and refuse to ven consider that your undestandin may be mistaken.Actually, Religion is not Anti-Sicnece by definition. The definition of Relgiion is a set of beelifs about he nature of our existence. How on Eath is that Anti-Science?The real probekm is, you won’t let go of the Myth that Relgiion and Sidnce ar in conflict, which was created in the 19th Century by Draper and White and hich has since been disproven.Also, Diggs thought the Stars may be other suns…You left out one important word from your definition of religion. Religions contain worship of a “supernatural”
 god. Belief in the supernatural is anti-science. That’s not a myth. It’s what those words actually mean.So, what you’re sayign is, Christianity is not a Religion.I may come off as Facicious here but, not all Christians accept that God is Supernatural. In fact, the Ancient Greeks didn’t think any of their gods were Supernatural, as their gods were the product of Nature and Evovled from it. The gods of the ancient Greeks and Romans wre personifications of Natural forces, and understood as the Spirit behind them, not as Supernatural entities that controlled them. So to you, the Greeks and Romans, whiel not Atheists, were also not Religious. Neither was Paul Tllich or Spinoza.I’m, sorry bt, Religion does not require the Worship of a Supernatural god. I know you need it to so that yoru Atheistic Materialism can be seen as Distinc from Religion, butgt the Reality is that this need of yours to create a distinxction between your beleifs and Relgiion is wrong.Further, even if we acept hat Relgiion requires the worship of a Supernatural god, which I remkdn you it does not, how does beleif in the Supernatural constitute beign Anti-Science in itself? Because yoju said so?You claim the word Supernatural itsef means Anti-Science. Well, no, it doesnt. The term Supernatural means Above Nature, it does not mean Anti-Science.I know you likely want to define Science as only the study of the Natural World, but two problems emere when you claim beleif in the Supernatural is by deifnition Anti-Science. One is, even if we accet that Science is only about the Natural World, beleif in the Supernatual that is not connected to the Natural is not rejection of the existence of the Natural World, and as a consequence one can still apoply Science tot he Natural.Further, you’re wrogn abotu what Science is. Science is not just the study of the Natural World. It’s the study of he Oberved World. If we cudl observe the Supernatural, then we coudl also apply the Scientific Method to it. Science is not limited tot he Natural World by its very Natue, our practice of Science is limited tot he Natural World as the Natual orld is al we can rpesently see.So, you’re enturley wrong. Bweleif in the Supernatural is not Anti-Science, and Relgiion  does not require the worship of a Supernatural god.Excellent post. I wonder why no mention of Lemarc(Jesuit priest)author of Big Bang theory.LemaitreIf you look at the 8 charges of which Bruno was convicted, there are several which are correct scientific principles, today:#2 is the infinite universe which Cosmos mentioned
#3 “There is no reality that is not accompanied by a spirit and an
intelligence.”  This is a basic phenomenological principle, so, not just science, but I would argue, scientifically valid.  In other words, for something to be perceived, there must be a perceiver.  It is a basic prerequisite to observation in experimentation.
#4 is, amazingly, conservation of mass (I was unaware this was a heresy)
#5 is that the Earth moves!  One might argue that the other 4 charges aren’t about science (at least in the way we view science), but certainly these, which comprise half of the charges, are, indeed, relevant to scientific progress in his day.The tally is not quite so high.Re #2: No one knows if the universe is infinite or not.  It’s hard to see how we could ever know for sure.Re #3: I agree with that sentiment, but then I’m a theist, nor am I taking it the way Bruno meant it.  Plenty of hard-core science fans would dismiss it as twaddle.Yes #2 is in dispute, even today.  Einstein, for instance, thought the universe finite.  But, the arguments of the day which promoted a finite universe do not stand up to Bruno’s theory.  I’d argue he was on the right side of the narrower argument.#3: Ah, but wasn’t everyone involved this debate at the time a theist?  Yes, this often falls under the heading of “philosophy,” these days, but the line was more blurry back then.  I think this qualifies.  Besides, science still is interested in this issue.  Just look at the double slit experiments!Te line between Religion and Ohilosophy isnt exaclty xlesr today either…To understand the charges, you have to let go of modern meanings and understand the way these charges would have been read at the time. #4, for instance, refers to the transformation of the Communion wine and wafer into the blood and body of Christ. A little different than the modern concept of conservation of mass!But there was not yet a distinction made between the phenomenon and the physics of the material world.  True, conservation of mass was thought to have implications in the nature of the Eucharist, but that just meant, from Bruno’s point of view, that such an understanding of the Eucharist had to be torn down in order for this principle to be understood.  At the end of the day, he was right.Of course, more to the point, he certainly didn’t deserve to die for this dissent.If I’m understanding you correctly, it’s actually the other way around. Bruno thought that the Earth had a soul, that the divine was present in all of those other planets and beings, and that conventional Church teachings about salvation and the divinity of Jesus were incorrect. In other words, he thought the miracle of the Eucharist permeated the universe. It was essentially a pandeist theology. Viewed that way, it makes more sense that the Church regarded Bruno’s cosmology as heresy, whereas Nicolas of Cuna escaped unscathed.If I’m understanding you correctly, it’s actually the other way around.

Viewed that way, it makes more sense that the Church regarded Bruno’s cosmology as heresy, whereas Nicolas of Cuna escaped unscathed.Wow!  My one short comment certainly opened a lot of speculation about my beliefs. What do I believe?  I believe there can be a rapprochement between faith and science.  Check out the work of BioLogos and Dr Denis Lamoureux.  Of course some skeptics can’t accept this just as some Christians can’t accept evolution, climate change or the big bang theory.  I work with several people who are atheists and agnostics–I accept and respect them and they accept and respect me.  We have great discussions on both science and faith.  It’s too bad the same can’t be said of this thread.First I want to say, I don’t appreciate the way Morva Adam spoke to you. You deserve personal respect, not sarcasm and purposefully hurtful phrases like “magical skydaddies”. As Phil Plait says, that’s wrong and doesn’t help. I’m sorry he said those things.However, I hold no respect for the *ideas* held by Dr. Lamoureux or the *goals* of the Christian advocacy group BioLogos. The only relationships between scripture and science is anthropology.You draw a false analogy between skeptics of these ideas/goals, and science deniers. I wouldn’t deny rapprochement, if by that you mean everybody getting along. The problem is, those ideas/goals contain religious apology which is very counter-productive to science. See the Nye/Ham debate for an example.Religion has no place in cosmology. That was part of the message of this episode, and Bruno was the right iconoclast for the job.I am Christian, and I believe that science belongs in the textbook and theology belongs in the church. I personally believe that our universe exists due to God (note the intentional non-use of the phrase “created by”) but as it is not a fact that can be proven, it cannot ever be reconciled with scientific discovery and presented as fact. It is a matter of faith, and should always remain that way.Any “scientist” who attempts to ascribe the process of evolution or the existence of the physical universe to a supernatural creator is at best a fool and at worst a humbug.Does this mean that I believe in a magical man who lives in the sky? Absolutely. Does this mean that I believe mankind came about as the result of random series of cause and effect, mutations, and such? Absolutely.How do I reconcile this internally? Not your problem, or the problem of that chipper fellow from before who wants to insult and burn bridges. I don’t ask you to hold respect for those people or their ideas. I do ask you and others who post online in this manner to be respectful and to understand that not everyone sees the world as they do. (To be fair, you’re much nicer that the other guy.)David, I hear that you feel no dissonance between belief in your personal god and the products of mainstream science. I understand a lot of people feel that way. I hope I have been (am being) personally respectful to you.I don’t have respect for that *idea* of a personal god. It seems like a god that makes no difference, or worse, a god of the gaps.The god that makes no difference isn’t the god of Giordano Bruno or Dr. Lamoureux. He’s just off-topic.The god of the gaps is the opposite of the central message of Cosmos: “We must understand the Cosmos as it is and not confuse how it is with how we wish it to be.”Well, wat aout me? I think of God as sort of liek he Authori of a Book.. he chose to create an orderly Universe that funcitosn on Fied laws and utilised those Laws as his Primary mechanism for development fo the Universe.In other words, the Scince we see is just how God did things, and you won’t find God in the Physical World anh more than the Characters in a Novdel will find direct Physical evidence of the Novelist.I think that Reason can defend Gods existance alone by hat e know of the Universe, but still think that God primarily functiosn via the Natueal mechanisms he established, and hsi control is more subtle. In that sence, while I am not a Deist, in that I think God oes occassionally interact with hsi Creation, I still see God mainly leaving the Unvierse up to the dictates of pre-existign Laws.This is also, Ironiclaly, the position taken by Meaeval Theologians. I justthinkw e know mroe about those Laws now.That just kind of makes God seem stupid and/or evil.Why? because you said so?I see nothgin overly cruel in God as I presented him.Why? because you said so?No, not because I said so.I see nothgin overly cruel in God as I presented him.You’re an exceptionally stupid person.  (Hey, at least you excel at something, right?!)So, instead of actualy telling us why you think what I said depicts God as either stupid or Cruel, you just call me an idiot?That is not really an argument, its just you ruttign aroudn un the gutters.No, I called you an idiot because your response of “Why?  because you said so?” was so idiotic given that God being stupid and/or evil is the only answer if one accepts the view you laid out.But I guess you need it explained so I’ll be brief.  The key point:   I still see God mainly leaving the Unvierse up to the dictates of pre-existign Laws.  Well, if that’s the way it is, then an all-knowing and supposedly perfectly good being purposely designed a universe where cruelty reigns, and where he does not deign to show his face.  This will often be defended by the religious by saying that it’s the “best possible” that could be created but given omnipotence and omniscience, this can’t be true.‘Nuff said.You’re part of “The Religious”. I knwo contemporary Athism has a deep rooted hated of Religion and see’s itself as the Antethesis of Religion, but its not. Yoru Humanistic and Materlaistic beleifs are as much a Religion as anyoen else.Also, please dont put words in my mouth.What you said is just how you descide to interpret it. I neither see Cruely reignign supreme in this world of ours, nor do I limit God to the world we see aroudn us. You have to do both to see God as either cruel or stupid. Instead, I understand God quiet differnelty and our world differently. For starters, I don’t think we liveonly in this life. If this is so, then whatever befalls us in this life, no matter what pain or tribulation ofccures, it is not the final blow to us.
I know that  you will mock as Pie int h Sky, becaue yoru own Relgiion demands you denegrate god and those who beleie in him, but given that you itterly failed to even consider this, it relaly betrays how short sighted your critisism is. If there is an afterlife, then even if this life is Cruel, its also rtemproary.With that said, I really dn’t thinkt his world is cruel. I’ve seen even Wild Animals show affection and concern.This life has problems yes, but it also has joys, and limitign it to “Cruelty reignign supreme’ is just silly.I also think God designed the Unvirse for us to have challenges, and for us to grow in a Psychological sense, to learn how to overcome obsticles, or to truly Love, or to know Sacriice. The problems in this world were thus creaed with an explicit purpise that overall does help us.But, again, you limit God, and my concerns, to only this life and then procceed to denouncethis life as where Cruelty reigns supreme. Well, that’s not how I see it. What i said did not depict God as either stupdi or Evil, but hat you brouth to what i said did.Incorrect.  Atheism is not a religion.  Partly because it is merely an acknowledgement of the poverty of evidence for the existence of any deity.  That’s it.  That’s all there is to it.  An acknowledgement of that one simple fact.  Hatred isn’t a part of it.As for putting words in your mouth, I didn’t.  The world definitely is very cruel, and while animals do show compassion, if you knew anything about the world you’d know what a brutal struggle it is for most animals.  Humans are somewhat isolated from that being at the top of the food chain.The idea that the universe is designed the way it is to provide us with “challenges” is absurd.  It’s that kind of thinking that makes people think you’re simple.  You’re proof that either religious belief leads to a weak mind, or that only the weak minded are religious.  I was correct in my initial assessment:  You are a colossally stupid person.I necr said Athrism was a Religion, but I hear this refrain a lot. However, Moern Athim is a Religion pr4cicely because it is far mroe than the beleif there are no gods. its essentially a Humanist Philosophy.By the way, Athism is a beleif there are no gods, not an acknowledgement abotthe pverty of evidence of the existance of any eity. If you beleif there are no gods because youthink a magic fairy told you so you’re syill an Atheist.The whole “Povery of evidene” routien is just an illustration of my point. To you, Atheism is linked to Logic, Ratioanlity, Evidence, and Science, which in itself takes Atheism beyind what it actually is.Atheism isnt the acknoeedgement of a simpel fact, and the “poverty of evience” is just a repeated dogma by you. The poitn is, you do hate Christianity, and generally Theism, or you’d not sit here arguong abotu hwo stupid and cruel God is or how stupid and cruel Christians are.lets face Reality, nohtign I say will matter sicne you’ve ecided in advance ahta is “The truth’ and, lik a good apologist, you’ll just argue form yoru position without even aknoeledging anythign the other person says. Look how you treated my comments about this life and its challenes. You all it absurd and sy this world is by fact Cruel. Don’t you hink its Tiem you admit that to you Atheism idnt a mere axcknoeleeme t that there is a poverty of evidence? Tgo you, any time anyone makes an argument to explain anythign that justifies any aspect of “Reliion’ you feel compelled to counter it. You dotn counter it becaue it si inherantly logiclaly flawed, you copunter it just because you feel the need to undermien Relgion and promote Ahism, which to you is asbout mroe than just one simpel fact.I don’t agree with you that the world is obvioduly Cruel, and its not becaue I’m simpel or Isolated. I grew up in Rural ztennessee and know mroe abotu Wldlife than most people as msot come from cities. I still dont’ se it as inherantly Cruel. Thatg’s from my own observations.But you can’t even discuss them because that requies you to admit the possibility that you are wrong and the way you see the world may be mistaken, or at the very least to admit that your opinion abou ho cruel the world is is itself subjective and not absolute. Instesd, you assert as an absolute fact that the orld is cruel and iI am simple.Well, rhat pretty well settls it then doesnt it?  Nothgin I say mattrs to you since you’re here to proslytie yoru own Relgiiosu Dogma and don’t care to allo others to really critisie it.I necr said Athrism was a Religion, but I hear this refrain a lot.Yes you did.  You said:  You’re part of “The Religious”. I knwo contemporary Athism has a deep rooted hated of Religion and see’s itself as the Antethesis of Religion, but its not. Yoru Humanistic and Materlaistic beleifs are as much a Religion as anyoen else.  It’s right there.Athism is a beleif there are no gods, not an acknowledgement abotthe pverty of evidence of the existance of any eity.It’s a rejection of belief based on the lack of evidence for any gods. Atheism is linked to Logic, Ratioanlity, Evidence, and Science, which in itself takes Atheism beyind what it actually is.Wrong again.  Atheism is linked to those things, of course, because without them there wouldn’t be a basis for rejecting religious belief.lets face Reality, nohtign I say will matter sicne you’ve ecided in advance ahta is “The truth’ and, lik a good apologist, you’ll just argue form yoru position without even aknoeledging anythign the other person says.I’ve acknowledged what you’ve said but every single point you make lacks any reason for me to believe it.  You can’t give me any evidence to support your beliefs.  I can support all my mine.  That’s how it works.  If you want to convince me, give me a reason. Don’t you hink its Tiem you admit that to you Atheism idnt a mere axcknoeleeme t that there is a poverty of evidence? That would be a lie.I don’t agree with you that the world is obvioduly CruelThen you don’t know anything of the world, but it’s the universe as a whole that is obviously exceedingly cruel.  Of course the universe itself isn’t capable of cruelty, but were it actually designed the designer would have to cruel and psychotic.I grew up in Rural ztennessee and know mroe abotu Wldlife than most people as msot come from cities.Are you sure it wasn’t Appalachia?  You’re either lying or you’re delusional.  Predators and prey.  That’s the natural world.  That’s the reality.  If it was designed that way, it’s even worse, and makes God look very bad.But you can’t even discuss them because that requies you to admit the possibility that you are wrong and the way you see the world may be mistaken, or at the very least to admit that your opinion abou ho cruel the world is is itself subjective and not absolute.Before I ever expressed that opinion I had considered every point you’ve raised and many others besides.  They don’t hold up.  I suspect you know this.  There are some people who desperately want to believe, and ignore anything that might make them reconsider their position.  That’s a weakness religion promotes.  Science teaches us to look at things a different way.Well, rhat pretty well settls it then doesnt it?  Nothgin I say mattrs to you since you’re here to proslytie yoru own Relgiiosu Dogma and don’t
 care to allo others to really critisie it.I suspect you know that’s not true.In another post, you said you have met plenty of sumb Religious people, but have never met a Dumb Atheist. Look in a Mirror.You think I called Atheism a Relgiion because I called your specific Materlaistic and Humanistic belifs a Relgiion, because you are uttelry incapable of reading anythign outside of what your Religion tells you. Let me explain it in this way. Religion is simply another word for Philosophy. As much as  people today like you would rpefer to think there is an absolute clear definitional distinction between the Two, there isn’t. Religion is nothing more than a set of beleifs that determines how we understand the world we live in, and covers topics from Mroal and Ethical behaviour, to the Nature of our Existance, to where we came from, and what our ultimae fate will be, to what the meanign of it all is. When I call yoru beleifs a Relgiion, I dont’ mean the belief there ar no gods, I mean the totality of the Humanistic beleifs you hold to.I know you’re too stupid to get that, but that’s what I’m refferign to.By the way, Atheism is not “Rejection fo belefi in dietiyes due to lack of Evidence”, its simply the belief that thee are no gods. Again, you can beelive there are no gods for uttelry silly reasons and still be an Atheist. You can become an Atheist because you think a Demon from Hell told you there were no gods, and you’d stll be an Atheist. You can be an Atheist because you think if God existed the Sky would be Redbecause you oreffer Red to Blue and you’d still be an Atheist.Atheism is not about Evidence, it’s a conclusion,  ot a Reason for the Conclusion. I know you’ll misrepresent what I just sid but, frnakly, I do’t care.By th way, your also stupid if you think that without Logic, Science, and Rason there would be no basis for rejectign Relgiosu belief. You reject “Relgoious beleif” for utterly Irrational Reasons yoruself.But he way, you didnt even Reject Relgiosu beleifs sicne yoru still Rligious. Your just too incompetant to realise this.Also, can the “no evidence’ routine. There is evidence for God’s existance and even the “Four arugments for God’s existance that have been disproven”, like the Ontological or Teleological Arugments actually rest on Evidence. The refian that there is absolutely no Evidence is just stupidity. I know tis a dogma to you that Faith is belief withotu Evidnee, Relgiion is another word for Tehsim, and people ar eonly Relgioosu because they ar stupid or gullible, but just asseing there is no evidence Doesn’t make it so.Hell, you evn use th “You didnt give me evidence to accpt yoru ebelifs” eot here. At this poitn its proven t be nothgin but a mantra. You arent even talking to me, yoru usign me as a proxy for a Christian sterotype you’re aruging with. I’m not actually tryign to prove Christianity is true here, I’m refutign yoru claims. And I have rpesented evidence for sayign yoru beleiofs are wrong. You just twist it becaue you have to fit everytgin inro yoyr own Religiosu Dogma.In short, yoru whoel Atist act is a Lie. You dont think for yoruself, dont use Logic, arent Rational, and dont care about science. It’s all a ruse. You just want to down Christianity. In fact, you just want to arue with a caricature of Christainity to validate yoru sense of self worth.Bythe way, I also dont think rpedator and rey is cruelty. Ut again, you wont drop the idea that the world is crel or even consider that this may be subjective opinion, becsue you need it to be “scinetific fact” that the world is cruel, and its relaly just proof of yoru dogmatism.In another post, you said you have met plenty of sumb Religious people, but have never met a Dumb Atheist.No, I didn’t.  You must be thinking of someone else.Religion is simply another word for Philosophy.No, religion and philosophy are separate and distinct.  Some theologians have been philosophers and have used philosophy in an attempt to explain (or “prove”) their beliefs, but no, they’re different things with different aims.your also stupid if you think that without Logic, Science, and Rason there would be no basis for rejectign Relgiosu belief. YNo, I’m not, and I’ve explained why.  Your idiocy is the reason you haven’t been able to understand anything I’ve said.  You know how colossally, superhumanly stupid you are.  You’ve probably had numerous, uncountable people tell you over the course of your life what an imbecile you are.  Your lack of success in school.  Your inability to understand anything that’s ever been said to you.  Your no doubt dead-end, bottom-of-the-barrel job.  All of it.  Your stupidity is of almost godlike proportions, which is funny since you’re a moronic theist.  Even I lack the ability to truly put into words how truly, spectacularly, abysmally stupid you really are.You just want to down Christianity.Nope.  That wouldn’t make any sense at all.Bythe way, I also dont think rpedator and rey is cruelty.That’s down to your gross stupidity.you wont drop the idea that the world is crel or even consider that this may be subjective opinionProbably because it’s not subjective.you need it to be “scinetific fact” that the world is cruel, and its relaly just proof of yoru dogmatism.Wrong again.  Your low IQ at work again.You’ve probably blamed your dyslexia for a lot of your problems, but there have been intelligent people who suffered it.  Your problem is that you’re so feeble minded.I don’t bame Duslexia for my Low IQ, I blame yiufor it. That may not make sene, but when you consider that I’ve actually tested Highly on standard IQ tests, what i said begins o become clear. I don’t have a low IQ, you just need to see me as havign a low IQ as that, along wht calling me stuoid, invalidates me and acts as a sheifl so you don;t have to address what I’ve said. In fact, you even imaine a life I’ve lived in which poepl call me an ibocile, complere with how I did poorly in School. That’d be odd given my 4.0 avergae in my Doctoral programme in PSychology.Look mate, calling me stupid and hen imaginign a life for me is just mroe evidence that you aen’t even talking to me but a creation in yoru head you project onto me. How is that remotely Rational?it also reveals why you;d want to down Christainity thoughm for the same reason you want to down me. You want to feel superior to the Cristains, and so by acceptign he neo-Atheist aruments and rpesentation fo what they say Christians are, you have a venue for it.It’s not liek you’ve bothered to study Christainity, all yu do is parrot the usual drivel we’ve seen a Million Times before.Nothign yu say is new or Intelligent, Even yoru “ZThe world is crel and this is obective fact; dgma isnt relaly remotely clever. Its just soemhign you need to be true as a prop to your greate rpurpose.Thats’ the Reality abotu you.The basis of my assumption of your low IQ is your comments.  Your inability to understand what I’ve said to you (and not just me, you have this problem with others) and your inability to articulate your own position.Further proof, by the way, is your claim of a 4.0 GPA in a doctoral program.  Your writing should stand by itself.  Is anyone going to be impressed, or have their opinion of you altered, by an impossible-to-verify claim like that?Actually yoru he one who distorted my points, andno, I dont have trouble understandign you, you have trouble understandign me. Just because I dotn capitulate to yoru ridiculus claims doesnt mean I dont understand them.Your responses to what I said were the basis for that claim, not the fact I haven’t persuaded you (which is something I never expected to happen).I didnt say that yoru filue to prusaide me. However, you seem to miss my pount. You say that my gettign a doctorate is imppssibel to verify. Well, isnt it also impossibel to verift that I did poorly in school and work a dead end Job? For that matter, where did you actually learn abotu me doign poorly in shookl or workign a Dead End Job? Do you know me personally?The reason I todl you I had a 4.0 and am gettign a Doctorate was not to impres you. Its actually True that I am, but irrelelvant. Even fi I made it up, the poitn remaisn that you have no actual basi for yoru claims abotu my life and how many peopel clealry call me an Imbocile. Yoru claism abotu my poor school perfoman and Dead End job were completely fabricated.Doesnt that undermine the claim you make abotu yorself as an Atheist?ow can you be said to be motivated ourley by Ratioanlity and Logic and only soeak where evidence is given when you make sweeping claims liek this?I’m sorr but, yor “Athdm’ is motivatedby Emotion, and is derived by Imagination, not by Rationality.Great posting above, Jim King. I agree wholeheartedly with you about the struggle animals have amidst humanity and what a terrible battle they have. If only all animal protectors and animal rights advocates would increase a million fold and their voices and actions made reality, we would slow this oncoming mass extinction that scientists and environmentalists have been cautioning all humanitarians about.
As for your assessment of the developmentally phonologically processing challenged one you are cleverly succinct with your second last statement; and amusingly decisive and direct with your closing. I enjoyed that, thank you.“Atheism is not a religion. Partly because it is merely an acknowledgement of the poverty of evidence for the existence of any deity” No, that’s agnosticism. Atheism is indeed the positive, faith-based position that there is evidence for the _absence_ of a deity.God is how humans construct God and expect God to be which in humans case a multitude of ever disagreeing religions doing exactly opposite to God Goodness. Look at the world of 2014, 2015, 2020.Of coruse this is just a proclamation with no evidence in its own Right…I suggest skwills read religious history coupled with the history of science and develop some degree of analysis without prejudice or bias and stop asking trivial questions that really have no concrete answers.
My God, your spelling is undivinely atrocious…indeed!Alan Braganza  –I suggest skwills read religious history coupled with the history of science and develop some degree of analysis without prejudice or bias and stop asking trivial questions that really have no concrete answers.I have rewd about the Hisory of Religion,as well as he History of Science. But I bet you havent. All you’ve done is visigd Atheist websites dsigned to attack Religion.My God, your spelling is undivinely atrocious…indeed!I am Dylexic. Why ar you in Love wth the word Indeed?Listen, it is becoming evident that your processing disorder is likely adding to your stubbornness in this argument so try to sympathize with the victims of the religious Inquisitions and yes, the early Christians running the institution, would have looked at your script and reasoning pattern and oh my gosh, I dare not think about it…you would scientifically sublimate!
…..indeed!……The Early CHristaisn did not run the Inquisition. It only came into existence in 1233 AD, and is exclusive to The Catholic CHurch. The Orthodox did not have The Inquisition.With that said, the Inqyisition itself wasnt what most peopel think it was. In poitn of Fact, the Inquisitional COurts had a Higher standard of Evidence, and a Higher Aquittal Rate, than the Secular ourts of its Era. They also tended ot be mroe Fair, and reccomend lesser sentences. (The Inquisiton did not actually senence anyone.)I also don’t see why you think I’d be in Mortal fanger from the Inquisitin based on what I said other than a need to villify it.Perhaps then, God is a creator far removed from creation and whether religion exists or whether religion is followed in really immaterial and insignificant to God so why must the creators of religions be as they historically were and are today? Does God intervene to save humanity really?No one invented Religion. Religion is just a result of havign a Kind that can understand the Eorld. Everyone has Religion, even Atheists. Religion is a blanket term that really covers any “Worldview” one can hold to.Religion is just the set of beleifs weuse as an intellectual framework to udnerstnd our own existence.As for how the “Creators” of Relgiiosn behaved, I think you ean the clergy who kept specific Religiosn going, not he actual Creators, an dyou seem to think all Relgiius “Creators” hve been somehow misbehaved. But can you relaly demonstrate that? Do youthink the Amish have a Hisotry of oppression? or the Jaines?Also, “Religious” doesn’t mean “Reoublican” or even “American” so yoru political point makes no sense in this ocnversation. Even if we acceptthat COnservativesand Republcians are Warmongers, it has nothgin o do with Relgiion in general as a topic.Thougj I will sya this, COnservaitves arent all Warmongrs or supporive of Vioence, nro are all Republicans.People or followers of a Holy Person developed their religion through Councils and establishment of doctrines, dogmas and tenets that in essence formulated belief rules and laws that all followers thereafter were expected to accept and conform to.
Religion helped followers to live a good and holy life in social circles that celebrated life.  It did not always go well so with disagreements there were divisions.
Sometimes I think in the human history of religion, there was more division in religion than in mathematics at that time.Alan Braganza  ,People or followers of a Holy Person developed their religion through Councils and establishment of doctrines, dogmas and tenets that in essence formulated belief rules and laws that all followers thereafter were expected to accept and conform to.Sort of liek how Neil DeGrasse Tyson and several others venerate the Words of Carl Sagan and act as if he were the perveyor of Infallible Truth, then. or how many Militant Atheists wuote dawkins or Bertrand Russel as absolute Authorities. Or how Ayn Rand’s followrs venerate her and htink if hse said somethign it must be True. or how Americans elevate their Fundign Fathers, and even build Temples to them.Religion helped followers to live a good and holy life in social circles that celebrated life. It did not always go well so with disagreements there were divisions.Like the American Revolution. Or the Introduction fo Big Bang which left many, infcludign Fred Hoyle, dismayed and who refused to acept it. Or like how both Dawkisn and Rusel, and Sagan foe that matrer, sough to repalce Relgiion with Reason, by which they meant imposing a Humanist Moral Code aon all of Society.A code we don’t all agree with.Sometimes I think in the human history of religion, there was more division in religion than in mathematics at that time.And yoy seem to not underdtnd Human History.Well, some Catholic Popes really misbehaved. Watch T.V. around Easter time to see the Borgias. The Amish have much unrest among their young who want to leave their old ways and integrate into modern society.
With Conservatives and Republicans, you’re right, they have less to do with religion and more to do with oil except that you get extreme Baptists and extreme Islamists with the same oil interests.Alan Braganza  ,Well, some Catholic Popes really misbehaved. So have many Humanit Leaders, or popel who ebraced the whoel “Reason over Relgiion” ideal. Bertrand Russel was a well known philandere who oden used women, often women many Tems younger than himself, for sheer pleasure and abandined htem whe he got bored wiht thm, and he also manipulated peopel and treated many, ibcludign his own Childen badly. Ayn Rand woudl try to completley dmenate her followers. H. G. Wells was a Racist and someine known for a Hot Temprer and also as a man who helopd a grudge. What abotu John F. Kennedy? Or Adolph Hitler? or heck, look at the actual Biography of Carl Sagan.So what?Watch T.V. around Easter time to see the Borgias. Or I could just note that Sicnetific Heroes are  just as often poorly behaved.The Amish have much unrest among their young who want to leave their old ways and integrate into modern society. But they don’t have a Hisory fo Warfare, or a History fo oppressing others.Which ws the discussion.With Conservatives and Republicans, you’re right, they have less to do with religion and more to do with oil except that you get extreme Baptists and extreme Islamists with the same oil interests.Bunk. Yoru oversimplifying matters. Not all COnservatives or all Republicans are Warmongers who ca eonly for oil. This is liek sayigall Lberals are Elitists who want to control everyones lives.Human understanding of the Cosmos is subject to newer revelations and theories when evidence proves such and science exists to evolve with empirical thinking developing consistently which is closer to TRUTH than merely FAITH.No its not. You hve to have Faith in order to beelvie any claim is Truth.Unles syou oull the toppe that Faith is beleif wihtotu evidence, but tis not. Faith means Trust. You have to Trust Science to use it, and Trust in evidence to beelvi ein it. This means you have ot have Faith in Science and Faith in the evidence.As I said, empirical thinking developed consistently allows science to evolve through concept developments and theory advancements which hold true in our physical natural world. Faith is more outside the real physical and natural world. You see science cannot explain the soul unless the soul is observable as a physical form or an energy. I am saying the fruits of science are closer to truth as we explain our physical reality rather that just believing something without physical evidence which is faith. In this instance, it would be faith in a metaphysical claim without physical proof. You need to have blind faith in religious doctrines, dogmas, tenets for example.
It is possible to follow logic and facts and know truth. Faith may be followed without logic and without all the facts and this is a belief based on faith.
Now the comparison is clearer: you can have truth with or without faith. Can you have faith with or without truth?Faith isn’t believing in something without Physical Evidence. Faith is a Synonym for Trust. Faith literally means you Trust something. Also, you are mistaken about Religious Faith. The idea that you need Blind Faith to adhere to Religious Teachings is a common one in these discussions but, it’s also one that can be easily shown to be wrong by picking up a book by a Serious Theologian like Rowan Williams, or Dallas Ward. It’s not about belief without evidence in the claims of the Religion, often those Religions offer Logical, even Evidence based arguments to support their views.Actually, I am not convinced here because for a multitude of followers of religion, whether Judaism, Christianity or Islam, the practice of not questioning and rather adopting a blind faith on some issues or doctrines is in fact adopted by followers for the sake of not having to question issues/doctrines or tenets which would be suggestive of doubt or need for concrete proof. It is here that general belief and faith come into practice without the need for evidence.  I could ask where is the physical evidence for transubstantiation at every Eucharistic celebration? How would you answer that?Everyone is a follower of Religion, even you. And at the same Time,., no one follows Religion.Religion is a Mercurial term that has no absolute maning, its just a general discriptor for beleifs, and frnakly I see no difference ebtween it and Philosophy.With that said, if you think peopel who follow Christainity, Judaism, and Islam just Blidnly accept what their Religions teach and never question it, and jist acept it on Blidn Faith, then yo havent read any books by a Theologian. Or the Talmud. or the Bible. Or even the Koran. Many Muslim, Jewish, and Christian Thinkers have very eaborate, highly detailed discussions on why they beelive what they do, and oft base it on Evidence. Oen cannot read the Suma Theologica by Thomas Aquinas and say its Blidn Faith eith no Evidence. Oen cannot rea the Talmud and say that either, or many Muslim Clerics.If you’r askign specificlaly about Catholci Doctine ( And I am not Cahtolic) Id suggest you read up on it.  Hee is fom the Afofementuend Thomas Aquinas.http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4075.htmHe did nto advocate just beleivigj in this without Evidence.Nor does The Catholic Church.Thanks for your response and web reference.  I had meant that there are many who want to have evidence for the mysteries or Doctrines of the faith and there are some who just accept the mystery in direct faith of the Eucharistic celebration where the bread and water are instantaneously changed in substance to the body and blood of Christ. Your answer is complete with St. Thomas Aquinas points on the Doctrine of Transubstantiation which in your reference I read entirely and have renewed understanding of the concept in terms of the progressive questions and statements of facts. It is good to have in this source evidence for doctrines, dogmas and tenets of Faith for reference. It helps strengthen Faith through clarifying understanding of the matters questioned. Still there remains the personal acceptance that God’s divine action completes the process of Transubstantiation in the body of the one receiving Communion.
As you say the other religions, Judaism and Islam have elaborate evidence for their respective tenets is acceptable to confirm beliefs. In these religions, there are several who also I am certain will accept doctrines readily as they were children when first introduced to their faiths so the interest to read further would either be in later years or not which for them would be belief based on direct faith in the celebration of their religious faiths.he same can be said of anything. Imagine a culture that is predomenalty Atheistic and that has emrbaced Secular Humanism. Many in that SOciety will beleive in Secular Humanism because this is how they wee raised. For that matter, if a person born in our Society is simply raised in Secular Humanism by secular Humanist Partents, he may stick with it withotu ever queationign it.The same is True of virtually everything. How many Americans know King George The Third wssa  Tyrant, America’s FOudners were Great Men, and the American form fo Government the best ever developed who can’t articulate hwo the Govebment even works or knwo anythign about the Revolutionaries or the Kign they opposed?Faith in the existence of God is the belief in God even though we can not see Him. God’s existence may be inferred in His creation of the universe and of the Earth generally. It becomes difficult to appreciate that catastrophic manifestations of natural phenomena are in essence created by God  because these are detrimental to all life on Earth. One may suggest that God made Nature but Nature is imperfect as much of nature’s creatures have imperfection’s or abnormalities. It so happens that science has physical evidence (measureable, reproducible and independently verifiable) that explains that an organisms subtle changes even mutations and their selection to propagate over millennia constitute the driving force behind evolution and change of organism forms.
Faith and Trust in Science is more widely accepted among all humans and this acts to unify humankind; while Religion has so many different manifestations of belief systems and Holy Leaders that hold different interpretations of Truth and may further divide humanity.You really need to Rad more.FOr stasrters, no one asks peopel tobeleive in God even though one cannot see him and there is no evidence fo rhim. To use Thomas Aquinas again, here is from the Suma Theologica..http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/aquinasfiveways_argumentanalysis.htmHere is from Rene Des Carte.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/There ae mroe but these are rather famous.As for Science Unitign Mankind, thats not True either. Science is liek any other Human Enterprise, fraought with disagrements, many of which are very heated.Science isnt a Unifyign force, its just another thign Humans use to Learn form and often argue over.When I seek truth, I need to see the facts or as many facts possible. With faith, the facts may not be all there in convincing form so faith relates closer to belief.  A belief in something may not suggest that is it absolutely true without physical facts.Beleif is anythign you think is True. Faith is Trust. Faith doesnt relate mroe closley to Beleif thsn to Truth, thats nonsenical Grammatically.Faith, again, is not beleivign in somethign wthotu evidence. One can have Faith in somethign precicely because it has ample evidence conclusivley provign it to be so.I am a Christain and I dont beelive in a Magical man int he sky, and iI dotn think Faith and Sicnece need to be kept separate. I do think e need to be careful in science to rpesent only what is absoluely known, but I find no real reason why Theology and Philosophy cannot incprporate the discoveries of Science.What’s a Christain?  Sicnece?  You’re a babbling idiot.I’m actually dyslexic.Does that prevent you from using spell check?  Most of those errors could have been corrected that way.Spell check works by a drop list that contains wods the compuer thinks you may mean. To you its a simpel matter of pickign the correct word, to me they all look alike unless I spend a good deal of Time concentratign on them.So, Spell Chekc is at best compersome, and ven then I hve no gurenteeof pickign the corect word out of similar words.Reading your script actually was creating a great deal of air pressure in the anterior part of my cranium to the point that I will now need a break.That won’t change my Dyslexia.skwills, If I could just say, just keep on doing your best; just know when to end an argument and accept disagreement. I hazard a guess that your schooling may have been a challenge and you continue to strive which you must and that will be good for you and for your success.
Now I bid you “Adieu” and I must get work done.
This is not really work but at least I advocate for rights: animal rights always and regularly but I reached this page to advocate for an early astronomer just before Galileo, a man called Bruno who was burned violently for his honest, engaging and heartfelt beliefs which opposed the Church of his time and well, they sublimated him and he is now star dust if it makes it feel better.
Indeed…Adieu…!If you’d bothered to read this Article you’d Realsie that Bruno was not Burned at the STake for Honest and Heatfelt beleifs that happened to disagre with th Churches. He was killed because he was a Troublemaker who made too many Enemies, and who was defiant till the end. His bad pesonality contributed heavily to ehat befell him. His actual Heresies were not even his COsmology which no oen cared about.Thanks skwills for your insights on G. Bruno and I agree that he must have disagreed enough with the very people who put him to death. I had read he was ahead of his thinking regarding other worlds like Earth and the church leaders did not want to hear that. You see at that time they believed that the Earth was the centre and the Sun went around the Earth. (Copernican) A decade later Galileo gave evidence for a sun centred universe for them so Bruno was ahead of his time. Still the people around him were skeptical and not very good. My point was that many scientist astronomers were given much opposition by the early church, the Catholic Church.
Thank you for your good and wise insight on this.You should read this Article. Bruno was not executed over his COsmology, which is explicity stated in the article wose comment section you are now in. Also, COpernicus actually taught Heliocentrism, not Geocentrism. He also was made a Cardinal and died peacefully of a Stroke in his sleep. Ptolomy came up with Geopcentrism.Bruno’s death was mroe due to his bad Persona;ity than hsi beelifs, and ofrmally he was charged with (And guilty of) practicing Hermetic Magic, deyign the Virignity of Marry, the Divnity of CHrist, and other such matters as well as telling peopel to worhsip Egyptian gods.Thank you. From your response and from reading above, I realize now that Bruno’s heresy against the basic truths of the Roman Catholicism, mainly that Bruno denied Christ’s Divinity; denied the Immaculate Conception, and denied transubstantiation had made him extremely disliked and therefore he was charged by the Roman Catholic Inquisitors and burned to death as punishment for heresy.
As he practiced magic and said animals and objects had souls which really did not fare well with people, just added to his disfavour and increased his enemies.
So he was really a bad personality even disliked by both Copernicus, (yes thanks, heliocentred universe) and by Galileo.
Well Bruno did make some bad choices in what he said although to consider animals as having souls suggest they are sentient in some way which I thought was a good consideration to have of animals just so they may be treated with humaneness and dignity not cruelty.I’m glad You are learning form this and not angry. I enjoy such talks. But unfortunately I do have a few more corrections.For starters, Jesus was not born Via Immaculate Conception in Christianity. Mary was, in Catholic Theology. The Immaculate Conception is not the same thing as he virgin Birth. It means Mary was born without Original Sin.Also, The Catholic Church does not have a problem with a belief that Animals have Souls. In fact, Catholicism teaches that they do have Souls. Whether or not those Souls are immortal is up for debate, but one is allowed to believe either as the Church has not ruled on it.It is engaging to have intelligent discussion of points and far from annoyance unless someone refuses to accept sound logic and accurate facts and instead writes words that do not make meaning. I do have to admit when writing is illegible, it would strain communication but here is my response:
By your above posting comment that you have more corrections, are you suggesting I am incorrect about my re phrasing of the article’s point that Bruno denied the Immaculate Conception of Christ and the virgin birth? I did see it written that he denied the virgin birth which suggests birth of Christ from the virgin Mary. I added immaculate conception because this is inferred by me. I am wondering why you are questioning my inference.I do question the accuracy of your statement above, that, “For starters, Jesus was not born Via Immaculate Conception in Christianity. Mary was, in Catholic Theology”.  Your error suggests Jesus’ mother Mary was immaculately conceived when this is incorrect. It was Jesus who was conceived immaculately as the Holy Spirit graced Mary and immediately,Jesus was conceived. I would believe that Mary was born the natural way from union of both her parents whom little is mentioned.
The second error you have made is one of assumption of my understanding, in your sentence, “The Immaculate Conception is not the same thing as he virgin Birth”.  Here you suggest that it is what I mean but I did not state this. I simply inferred that adding to the statement that Bruno denied the virgin birth.
As an animal advocate, I accept that our pets have a soul so this is more personal; however I am not alone in this belief.You don’t seem to understand. The Immaculate Conception is the Catholic Doctrine that says Mary was Born without Sin, and thus as a suitable vessel to carry Jesus. The Immaculate Conception is not the same thing as The Virgin Birth of Christ, it’s a separate Doctrine all together. The Doctrine of The Immaculate Conception states that While Mary was not Born of a Virgin, she was born free of the Stain of Original Sin.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htmAlso, it should be noted that This was not defined by the Church until 1854, meaning it was not considered Heretical to reject it until then, and one could be a Catholic in Good Standing if one did not believe in The Immaculate Conception. The belief existed since Ancient Times, but was not a Dogma of the Church until the 19th Century. Protestants also reject The Immaculate Conception, and Eastern Orthodox Christians do not need it as they reject the basic concept of Original Sin all together.I agree with you on Animals and feel that Humans tend to think only of themselves and are an arrogant species.skwills,  I recognize my misconception of the two Doctrines.  While accepting both the Immaculate Conception and the Virgin Birth my memory of the terms from my high school religious studies class is at best a little vague now several decades later as unless a concept of religion or of science is made with good foundation, a fertile learning mind may not comprehend fully and effectively for retention and recital later.I now accept my errors in thinking that immaculate conception was Jesus’ conception when it really correctly relates to Mary’s conception in her mother’s womb, excluded from original sin. Reading from the definition at Wikipedia, sets me straight about the Virgin Birth which I can reiterate relates to Jesus being conceived through the Holy Spirit in Mary’s womb, while she remained a virgin.I will respond further later. Thanks.No wirries. Thanks for the polite conversation.Thank you for your insights.
I appreciate this discussion and respect differences in opinions as I like to keep my learning open and open for new wisdoms.The poor Giordano Bruno  dared to think differently and actually challenged accepted thinking of his time and when questioned about it especially regarding the very tenets of Catholic faith, he still did not recant and so they, the Roman Inquisitors tried him in court for seven years.
 The authoritarian Catholic Church of his time did excommunicate him and Bruno was persecuted for his open minded beliefs amid a traditional and suppressive church unwilling to accept new and forward thinking notions.
I do not recommend people to adopt Bruno’s belief’s but to recognize that Bruno was a remarkable free thinking intellectual and made extraordinary connections among some of the stuff and crusty authoritarians who were accustomed to blind obedience. The closed mindedness of the institutions refused to accept Bruno’s remarkable thinking so they felt justified when he refused to recant his doubts, to burn him at the stake which was cruel and typical closed mindedness of the church at that time.
Bruno’s philosophical thinking influenced thinking for centuries after and this is why I think Bruno’s life was tragic.Bruno 2was not Ipen Minded. Bruno insulted anyone who disageed with him. He was far mroe Authoritarian and Dictatorial than the Catholic Churc, which took 14 Years ot bother with a Trial for him. Bruno’s execution was liekly more the result of his own rotten personality and the sheer number of peopel whom he had attacked decidign to put an end to him, ratyher than just his beleifs.AGain, read this artucle. The CHurch was not really all that CLosed Minded.There were many so called intense personalities of genius and near genius in antiquity and Bruno was thinking beyond his years irrespective of whether he was liked or disliked. Sir Isaac Newton was a difficult personality also and he ranks among the greatest contributors in science and mathematics in human history. Bruno was the first to have made some fascinating statements about other worlds and so Bruno was quite ahead of his time in that matter. Please read this very good reference which comments in discussion on this very issue of Discover written by Author, Corey S. Powell with Cosmos co-writer Steve Soter about Brunos inclusion in Cosmos. (http://www.ciclops.org/news/making_sense.php?id=7862&js=1)   Bruno passionately described at that time so very long ago before Galileo Galilei what understood to be the fundamental difference between stars and planets and so Bruno elaborated upon Copernican thought and gave humanity the first understanding of the astrophysical universe never before described like that.
It is exactly for Giordano Brunos contributions to helping both understandings in science and in philosophy that all science and astronomy must acknowledge him even if the church may choose not to for the reasons already substantiated.
It’s noteworthy and significant observation by one person who had tremendous struggle in his life. May he be acknowledged, even if not recognized a hero because of it all.Cosmos is written by Men who have a clear Agenda besides just teachgn Science. Much liek the original Cosmos, theypromote the same Humanism of Carl Sagan, who was also the Master of Tyson when he was in School.The Real Reason Brunio was included was the same Reason as the Christians killign ypatia because she was three thigns the Chruch cdl dtnd, a Oagan, a Woman,a nd an Intellectual in the original Cosmos. It wa sincluded to ropogate he idea of Christianity holding back Science and Reason. And liek Hypatia, this new Cosmos got Bruno’s story wrong.Bruno wasn’t killed over his Cosmology, and his personality was not merley difficult but outright combative.He also never relaly contibuted to the development of modern Science or our understndign of the Univere. Yiy won’t find any serious Historians of Science sayign h e advanced our understaning. he was just an occultic figue who happeend to be made into a Hero in the 19th Century becaue his sotry coudl be used as propaganda to attack Christedom with base don the newly mnted myth of Science and Relgiion beign in conlict.There is evidence to the claim that Christianity or the religious leaders of that time held scientists, science and reason in scrutiny and constrained free thinking and comfortable scientific progress in those times.  The Church were the authorities of learning and opposed any challenge to their accepted views during the Christian Dark Ages before the Renaissance.  “…Turn our thoughts, in the next place, to the characters of learned men. The priesthood have, in all ancient nations, nearly monopolized learning. Read over again all the accounts we have of Hindoos, Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Celts, Teutons, we shall find that priests had all the knowledge, and really governed all mankind. Examine Mahometanism, trace Christianity from its first promulgation; knowledge has been almost exclusively confined to the clergy. And, even since the Reformation, when or where has existed a Protestant or dissenting sect who would tolerate a free inquiry? The blackest billingsgate, the most ungentlemanly insolence, the most yahooish brutality is patiently endured, countenanced, propagated, and applauded. But touch a solemn truth in collision with a dogma of a sect, though capable of the clearest proof, and you will soon find you have disturbed a nest, and the hornets will swarm about your legs and hands, and fly into your face and eyes.     [Letters to John Taylor, 1814, XVIII, p. 484]”
―     John  Adams,     The Letters of John and Abigail Adams “Nicholas de Cusa (1401-1464), an ecclesiastical reformer, administrator and cardinal, was also a great influence on Bruno. The idea of evolution appears in Nicholas de Cusa in a somewhat pantheistic form, but is further developed by Giordano Bruno with greater clarity both for physics and metaphysics. Giordano Bruno’s unitary concept of nature found admiration by very important philosophers/scholars such as, Baruch de Spinoza, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. While his overall contribution to the birth of modern science is still open to debate, many believe Giordano Bruno to be much more a philosopher than a scientist. Issac Asimov disregards him as a “philosopher and poet” rather than a scientist, though he sees scientists as dreamers. Scholars such as Frances Yates believe his ideas on an infinite universe without geocentric structure were a critical shift between the old and new modes of thought. Bruno’s concept of multiple worlds is also viewed by some as a forerunner to Everett’s many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Some also believe Giordano Bruno was one of the precursors to Sir Isaac Newton’s theory of place and absolute space.”  (http://www.egs.edu/library/giordano-bruno/biography/)John Adams was not a Historian,and simply because he wrote a letter doesn’t mean anything to me at all. In fact, it always baffled me why people who say we shouldn’t just quote the Bible as if its an unquestionable Authority and how we should critically evaluate its claims because its foolish to just Blindly believe in things because they were written down would then turn around and blindly accept the word of some famous guy they respect, be it Carl Sagan, Aldois Huxley, or in this case, John Adams. Other than being an American Founding Father, what really makes John Adams important  here? Why does being an American Founding Father even matter. John Adams was wrong. Priesthoods did not hold back Knowledge all the Time in every Culture. In fact, the Priesthoods in various Cultures often acted as the only orginised group of people actually Teaching people things.As for the “Evidence” that Christianity has held Science back and that they tries to suppress Free Thinking and looked with disdain over Scientific Developments or Critical Thought, you haven’t shown such evidence, you just made an assertion. Worse still, Jon Adams letter to Abigail Adams wasn’t even saying this, he was critical of Orginised Priesthoods, not of Religion in and of itself. John Adams was a Congregationalist, and the Congregationalist Church had no Priesthood. Adams was saying that he did not like Priesthood, not that he didn’t like Religion.There was no such thing as The Christian Dark Ages. In fact, there was no such thing as The Dark Ages period. The Medieval World was not The Dark Ages. The term “Dark Ages” is no longer used by Historians, and the Concept most people have of the Thousand Year period as a Time of Stagnation and oppression is purely  Fictitious, as The Middle Ages was in fact a Time of relative peace and stability, and actually did see both Technological Advancement and development of Philosophical Ideas. Anyone who speaks of The Dark Ages is simply ignorant of the Realities of the Middle Ages, and anyone who thinks its The Christian Dark Ages as if Christianity is somehow responsible for the nonexistent stagnation is simply being duped by a Myth created as a polemic against Christianity.Historians like  Regine Pernoud or Morris Bishop have debunked the idea of the Middle Ages as a Time of brutality, oppression, and Anti-Intellectualism. You can even look this up for Free on the Internet, just visit the Encyclopedia Britannica, or heck even Wikipedia, and you will find that The Dark Ages is a Myth that isn’t taken seriously by actual contemporary Historians.Bruno was not that influential and remains someone who was contentious in his Lifetime and who suffered more because of his own arrogance than any sort of control over Thought at the Time.If you do not keep Faith and Science separate then you may get Creationism which is Fundamentalist and states Earth is some 6000 years old.
Tell me about the Native populations of North America 11000 to 12000 years ago that lived and existed in harmony with Nature and were religious and respectful to the Earth. This was North America before white Europeans and it was called Earth but Judaism, Christianity and Islam were non existent and not even planned for.
Think of what the closed mindedness of religions have done to people like our above open minded forward thinking hero Giordano Bruno who was unwilling to denounce his beliefs.
We certainly do not need religious oppression or fundamentalist thinking because it all creates dissent and rebellion.Alan Braganza  ,
This makes no sense.If you do not keep Faith and Science separate then you may get Creationism which is Fundamentalist and states Earth is some 6000 years old. You can’t keep Faith and Science separate.. In order to use Science you haveto have Faiht in Science.If you ean “Relgiion”, keep in Midn that Religious beleif is abut the Real WOrld we liv ein, to jeep it separate mean syouthink it snot connected o the Real World. Peopel arent going to hodl contradictory views.Also, the Irony of Creationism being called Fundamentalist is that the original Fundamentalists didn’t have as much a Problem with Evolution.
Also, not all Creationists are Young Earth Creationists, and frankly I dont se why you care if oseone else thinks the Earht is 6000 Years Old or why this is considered a big threat.Tell me about the Native populations of North America 11000 to 12000 years ago that lived and existed in harmony with Nature and were religious and respectful to the Earth. Why? There was no Seqway and Im not sure what yu want me to tell you about them.This was North America before white Europeans and it was called Earth but Judaism, Christianity and Islam were non existent and not even planned for.
Er, No one thinks thye existed 12000 Years ago, so Im not sure what the poitn is here.Well, except Islam says it existed sicne Adam but needed to be Restored often.Think of what the closed mindedness of religions have done to people like our above open minded forward thinking hero Giordano Bruno who was unwilling to denounce his beliefs.Bruno was not a Hero. Bruno was a Loud Mouth, Argumentative, Hostile bafoon who alinated all of his supporters and created far too many enemies, and he was nto remotley open Minded. Bruno condemend, with harsh words no less, anyoen who disagreed with him.Had Bruno been in charge and bace dby peoel who blived his ideas he’d have been far worse than the Catholic CHurch.We certainly do not need religious oppression or fundamentalist thinking because it all creates dissent and rebellion.Rhe Catholci Churhc is not now nor wa sit in the Tiem fo Bruno Fundamentalist. I dont think you even know what the term Fundamentalist means.Jerry D. Albert from California, writes about four reasons why special creationism should be rejected, “its dangers to personal, biblical Christian faith, and its role as a pseudo-scientific threat to science education” in The Dangers of “Special Creationism” to Christian Faith. If closed mindedness is a detriment to both religious enlightenment and to creative objective scientific reasoning, then an appreciation that open not constrained thinking needs to be the way to gain harmony without dissent and rebellion. Paul Davies writes that, “As we enter a new century likely to be dominated by sweeping scientific and technological developments, the need for spiritual guidance will be stronger than ever. Science alone cannot adequately cater for our spiritual needs, but any religion that refuses to embrace scientific discovery is unlikely to survive to the 22nd century. Religion faces extraordinary challenges in the 21st century. ”  “Few theologians have kept up with the revolutionary developments at the forefront of astronomy, physics, molecular biology or genetics. Churches and other religious institutions seem ill-equipped to deal with the brave new world of big bang cosmology, quantum reality, genetic engineering and nanotechnology. As a result, many people see religion on the defensive against the onslaught of scientific progress. They think of science as undermining or displacing religion.  ”
(  http://inters.org/Davies-Science-Religion-21st-century )” many cases exist in which religious and scientific perspectives present no conflict at all. Thousands of scientists busily carry out their research while maintaining personal spiritual beliefs, and an even larger number of everyday folks fruitfully view the natural world through an evidence-based, scientific lens and the supernatural world through a spiritual lens. Accepting a scientific worldview needn’t require giving up religious faith.   ”
(http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/science_religion  )  Regarding the infamous Bruno, he really was a very unsavory character for he made the gravest mistakes being a man of Christian faith, denouncing key doctrines of Catholicism and showing no remorse or recanting even when tried in court for a number of years. He undoubtedly will be remembered as such and also that he thought differently in his cosmic views of the heavens. “…Turn our thoughts, in the next place, to the characters of learned men.

Albert from California, writes about four reasons why special creationism should be rejected, “its dangers to personal, biblical Christian faith, and its role as a pseudo-scientific threat to science education” in The Dangers of “Special Creationism” to Christian Faith.We aren’t talking about Creationism. We’re discussing Giordano Bruno and the wider implications of how men like Neil DeGrasse Tyson actively promote a false vie of History in the context of Science VS Religion.With that said, I am not a Creationist, but I really don’t think Creationism harms people. It just comes off as silly to me to think it does. How is this any different from someone like Ken Ham saying belief in Evolution harms society as well as Biblical Faith? To me, it just seems like people want to depict something they disagree with as dangerous rather than simply disagreeing with it.If closed mindedness is a detriment to both religious enlightenment and to creative objective scientific reasoning, then an appreciation that open not constrained thinking needs to be the way to gain harmony without dissent and rebellion.But isn’t telling people that Creationism is a danger to society itself just closed minded?

― John Adams, The Letters of John and Abigail AdamsJohn Adams was a hot tempers man who committed Treason against the Crown. I’m not very impressed by his opinions.Thank you for your views. When disagreements regarding conflicting ideologies are made such as with Creationism and that statement that Creationism is dangerous, I can only compare it to why certain ideological beliefs not generally accepted may be given that same critical thought. Perhaps the author Jerry D. Albert has his strong convictions as he wrote but more serious are the current ideologies followed by Islamic radicals that do not embody any doctrines of the Islamic faith. Enough said on those points as this debate on religion may extend indefinitely.
Paul Davies, a scientist was making his opinion on those facts which are valid and  true to fact because as science continues to explain the universe with better theories, our very existence is better understood. Religion exists with all its core doctrines with science’s pace and any controversial assertions by some religions will need to be abandoned when science explains such with improved evidence (creationism vs fossil record evidence) that the majority of people would embrace. By the same logic and valid argument, if Jesus were to return in His Divine glory for Judgement and announce it as such just before the end of the world, I really think that all the most skeptical scientists would need to be listening.
Regarding the selection of Giordano Bruno by Cosmos and to make their point was probably not helping the science vs religion debate; however, Neil de Grasse Tyson said what he needed to say whether he wrote the script to include Bruno or not. It appears to me that Cosmos will pick characters to raise their ratings whether controversial or not. In this case, it spurned debate and so much on this blog. Hopefully this will allow better documentary programming and more objective science shows.
 I did not particularly favor that episode more than others. I rather prefer to have instances when the people featured happen to be both scientists and religious because it shows the duality of ideological being where there is balance between the two.
There is and will always be the need for understanding between people of science and people of religion regarding mutual respect and their ideologies just as science documentary producers have an obligation to accurately state facts and be objective. They owe it to the viewer.
Wish you well, skwills.David,
Despite your clever language (“created by” vs “exists due to”), why is this a fact that can’t be proven?  In what way does the creation/existence of a universe escape the ability of logical evidence?
Thanks,
ScottScott– There is a realm of theological thought that God created the universe and all of it’s rules; and then left it to run its own course. I have seen this described as “deism” but I am not fully versed in their beliefs, so I’m not sure if that’s absolutely what I believe. I am a software developer, and I think my beliefs can best be summed up as saying that I see God as one who created a vast simulation of physics, and allowed that simulation to run its course with minimal interaction. He is still a “creator” in that sense of belief, but not in the sense that he created the universe solely for mankind through the process described in Genesis. I’ve told this to others and they said what I believe is intelligent design; but I reject that also as people who believe in intelligent design still believe that God did it all for us. He did not.So what about the bible, and Jesus, and the prophets, etc? I think the books of the Old Testament were written in a time of great chaos and barbarism; and were associated with God to give them authority, when their real purpose was to be used as a series of laws, written by man. If you notice, most of the dogma and so-called “hatred” you see from the church now originates from the laws of the Old Testament.The New Testament was written after a time of religious rule, by people who believed that the laws of the Old Testament had been subjugated in order to set up a religious caste of rulers, and they were slowly rejecting that idea. Again, what better way to get people to agree with you than the base your books on a great leader, a King, who was prophesied from the very laws that they current followed?I am not a bible scholar, so please take my thoughts with a grain of sand, and investigate on your own. This is just how I see the text after reading it.Actually, nothgin in Genesis says God creared the Universe, or even the Earth, for Man. Indeed, while this may be a popular beleif, its not in the text andnot really a component central to Christian or Jewish thought.Actually, it does say that.  More than once.  I guess, like most Christians, you haven’t read it.  I bet your faith would not survive if you did.Quote it saying that God mae the whole world for Man, mroe han once.or even just once.I dare you.It’s right there in Genesis.  Are you sure you’re really a Christian?  You don’t seem familiar with the Bible at all.Quoge it and prove how Ignorant I am. Show me the quote from Gnesis that says the Universe was made for Man. Or even just this world.Wuldn’t you liek to prive how wrogn I am and how stupid and uninformed? Well, here’s your chance.Quoge it and prove how Ignorant I am.Okay.  Genesis 1:26 and 1:28.  I’ve already shown how ignorant you are, though.  I’m surprised you’re not tired of it.Show me the quote from Gnesis that says the Universe was made for Man. Or even just this world.It’s this world, but of course in those days there wasn’t any distinction between the world and universe.Wuldn’t you liek to prive how wrogn I am and how stupid and uninformed?I would!Well, here’s your chance.And I took it!You know whats interesting, if that’s the right word, about you? How you desicde what is and is not the Truth based on yoru own Relgiious DOgma, and then refuse to see anytign btu that, and tghen how you think those who don’t accept what you say are idiots.Well, hre I m provign I’m an idio to you again by pointign out that your wrong.You didn’t quote Genesis 1:26 or 1:18, youjust referenced them. I will quote them. Before I do though, I’d like to note that neither of thsoe verses actually say the World was Created for Man.Read what I’ve said, and this Time, dnt;’ just say “Yoru worng, ti does mean he mae the world for Man” and act liek thats that. It never ocne actually says this.26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.Tes it says Man has DOminion over the Earth. However, Dominion simply means Man Governs, or Rules. To assume this means Man is the Reason for the Earth beign Created from this is however unjustified. I knwo you want to make that assumption and won’t be able to swallow your pride and admit you were wrogn and will call me an idiot or say I’m twistign thigns but, the term “DOminion” does nto mean “You are the prupose for this thing”. This is liek sayign a Kigndom exists for the King, or that Staes in AMerica exist for Governors.Man beign given Dominion over the Earth is not evidcence that God’s sole purpose in Creatignt he world was Man, it only means God left Man in CHarge of the Earth,. The two are distinct.“Actually, it does say that.  More than once.  I guess, like most Christians, you haven’t read it.  I bet your faith would not survive if you did.”Upvoted your comment… but I do think it is ironic that your name “Jim King” is almost dead on “King James”  Jim isn’t short for James is it… Actually, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have a God concept where by God is authoritarian, angry and ever punishing to instill fear in followers and to be forgiving in their controlled masses. Yet tremendous carnage and modern day wars have resulted because of these top three religions of humankind. Not very honourable or good, indeed!
While the Amish, the Jains and the Buddhists are more gentler with healthy reverence to regard animals highly and to protect nature. Very honourable and good…indeed!
It is ironic that the political parties such as the republicans and the conservatives have all favoured initiating and perpetuating wars; analyze political terms when wars happened.Alan Braganza , Thank You for confirmign that yiu’re just here to bash the Abrahamic Faiths, mainly Chriatianity.
 mean, coem on, this is a Howler.. Someone said that acordign to the Bible all of Creation, or at least theEarth was made for man and this is said Several Times, and the only passage he cites that says this doens’t actually say this. I pointed this out and you say the following.Actually, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have a God concept where by God is authoritarian, angry and ever punishing to instill fear in followers and to be forgiving in their controlled masses. 
Even if this were qactually True, it’d have no barign whatsoever on what was discussed beforehand. Of coruse it snot True either, as Judaism, Christianity, and Ilsam have an understanding of God that is Loving an Benevolent, not just Authoritarian and VInductive, and noen fo them want you to worhsip God jist out of Fear.What your postign is just propaganda designed to promote a negative viw of the Abrahamic Faiths, not Facts,and its certianly an irratinal respicne here. but yoru rela Motiveisnt to address topics its just to bash Christianity.Yet tremendous carnage and modern day wars have resulted because of these top three religions of humankind. Not very honourable or good, indeed!
This is what I mean. its pretty obvious that you’re just writtign polemic here. You want to depict thwm as basiclaly repsincibel for Great Evils thta’d not exist of hey didnt exist,a dn of corus ignore any good that followrrs of these Faiths have cdone inspied by their Respective Religiosu Traditions.The idea that Abrahamic relgiion is Warlike and yeidls only War and Division is an old Canard and not remotley True, and you don’t even really buy it.While the Amish, the Jains and the Buddhists are more gentler with healthy reverence to regard animals highly and to protect nature. Very honourable and good…indeed!Doens’t this contradict yoru above statement though? After all, the Amish are Christians. You want to depict Christians, as well as Muslims and Jews, as prousing Carnage, so why praise the Christain Amish?Also, iw Warlike are modern day Disiples of Christ? Or the Churches Of Christ? How about modern day Christuian Churches? Mormons? Community CHurch? Anglicans?WHy single out one CHristain Dnomination as good and act as if the test are just awful?It is ironic that the political parties such as the republicans and the conservatives have all favoured initiating and perpetuating wars; They havent.In fact, many COnsrvatives, and tgis includes Republicans, favour Peice, like ROn Paul.Meanwile, you have doem very Hawkish Left WIngers, liek Holary CLinton, and even President Barrack Obama.analyze political terms when wars happened.WHy? You sure don’t.It’s your dyslexia/dysgraphia that makes me think of Atticus Shaffer who plays Brick Heck in The Middle. Your angst and frustration is understandable since Exner’s writing area of the frontal lobe has now been implicated. You must take a break and go watch television because you like Brick operate to follow the beat of your own drummer.Alan Braganza ,Read this entire post if you will.It’s your dyslexia/dysgraphia that makes me think of Atticus Shaffer who plays Brick Heck in The Middle.I have no idea who that is.I don’t watch “The Middle”.So, its pretty much meanignlss as a reference to me.Religions are man made constructs that clash with one another based on fundamentalist and extremism so of course, there is a history of carnage since inception and this will only perpetuate.This is of coruse bunk. Religion is just a term we use to describe beleifs. Even peopel who today we call Non-Religious, like Atheists, are actuakly Religious. Religion isnt Man Made, its the resutl fo Consciousness. All Religion is just how peopel frame an understanding of existence. Religion and Philosophy are the same thing.I like religion for its ideals in bringing people together in collective prayer and mutual understandings. Not all Religions have this.It would help if religions curb their imposing expectations on politics. That ay people liek you who “have no Religion” can impose your beleifs on Politics instead.This is why I don’t buy the distinction. Whenever peoepl sy Religion needs ot be out of Politics its so they can order Society and Politics aoccordign to their own prnciples and beleifs.Its really just a way to get yoru own way.Well, why should yoru “Non-Religion” be imposed on everyone?If religion only behaved as science then it would realize its challenges but religion is not scientific.This is of coruse nonsensical. Neither Religion nor Science behave at all. Peopel do. And unike the Carl Sagan insopired idea that Religion nev3r changes, wgilst Scienc e does, the fact is that Religion does actually change over Time. And Sicence isnt as open to change as peoepl think, because the Peopel who are Scientists are often themselves resistent to Change.Your angst and frustration is understandable since Exner’s writing area of the frontal lobe has now been implicated and I prefer not to argue as my beliefs are sound and can be proved but not here to you.I’m not Frustrated and I don’t feel any Angst. Im contradictive to yoru posts, but that snot th esame thing.Also, stop tryign to sound smarter thna you are. Im critical of yoru simplsitic an dmisguided assessment of Relgiion, thats not really about my Frontal Lobe.You must take a break and go watch television because you like Brick operate to follow the beat of your own drummer.This is like yoru sayign Religion shouldn’t impose itslf on Politics. It’s just you tryign to get rid of opposition without havign to address its concerns.You are an ineffective and inconsistent thinker and skwills, you really come across rather ignorant whether your angular gyrus is in stasis or not.The only Reason your sayign this is to belittle me personally and to bluster. Do you really think callign me an Inconsisent Thinker or Ignorant really invaliates what I’ve said? You know, the actual things you’ve chosen to not address?No exception for you today…and go and pray to God if you have a religion.Everyone has a Religion, even you. That’ the poiunt.Wow, you took much time to reply to my post and please know I am sorry because I did not intend to offend you as you said belittle you so I am mentioning this because you do have some good insights and comments which make sense to me.
Now as for the t.v. show, “The Middle”, the person I mentioned is interesting because of intelligent connections he makes but he does become frustrated as expected with his school and home  life as we all may have experienced and may still do. Not important if you have watched this show. Still it would be good for a few laughs because the whole show is a comedy.
Where I disagree with you is where I know religion to be man made and organized as in all the major world religions which have set ceremonies that its followers must pass as they age, when they marry and when they die. The clashing of religions I mentioned are the clashing of ideologies resulting in wars and the carnage then and now and in the future.
The religions of the world while different still share similarities and these similarities are and ought to be our common understandings to share appreciation of God or the concept of The Divine Being. There are people who interpret their religions with extremism and they do very bad things such as what we know about wars in the middle East.
Some religious leaders like to pressure politicians to adopt a controversial stance say on LGBT rights, Right To Life rights compared to Pro Choice for women. This latter one is very topical and controversial (I won’t say indeed now…I was trying to be funny) Women victims of rape and incest may choose not to have the unwanted child and this should be their option and accepted by medical staff to perform an abortion because of the consequential implications of the victim carrying such to term.  You see there are exceptions to everything.
So please know that I think you have made a good argument and I really hope that your typing and writing with how you select your words will become easier for you.
You have shown yourself to be thinking well and you have made some points effectively well with words and intentions that resonate with me so thanks for taking the time to respond to some of my postings.
I will continue later.RELIGION doens’t cause Wats, disagreement and desire do. How many Wars wee fouht in the Modrn Era over Poliical Ideals such as Democracy? Lots. That only mans Men will kill other Men over disagreements, I dotn see Religion as particulalry moe potent.As for rituals, they exist anyway. EVen if we pretend not everythign is Relgion, Atheits go hrough weddign ceremonies, and have Funerals which are ritualised.Thats why I say everyone is Religious, as Relgiion is not created, its just partof how Humans were built. We may nto call our beleifs and rituals “Religious”, but thee is no real Difference. Just Visit Washington DC and lok at hte Idols to Lincopln and Jefferson and the like, hwo are they diffeent from Religious STatues exactly?The whoel term Relgiion is just invented, there is CUlture, and peopel have beleifs, and thats all there is to it.Yes, agreed, it is the discontent among the religious extremes that promote violence and wars and we see this in history and in present day. There are people of conflicting religious beliefs sometimes in opposing countries that will act on their disagreements and discontent with one another as in wars and these are politically motivated.
Religion being invented and man made in essence, does not follow the principles of science as the scientific method of old but religion instead relies on faith, trust and belief systems that are regularly practiced in social gatherings or ceremonies.
A ritual need not be religious such as an athlete doing pre-preparation before an event.I like your suggestion about the statues to Lincoln and Jefferson and all, about how they are different from religious statues and I must say that they were likenesses of US Presidents while the statues and paintings of Jesus and Mary and others were close approximations of artists depictions of the real Jesus and real Mary. You see, no one at their time had them sit down for a portrait drawing or sculpture. Right? We have our inferred depictions and this brings us back to how people have depicted Jesus sometimes rather light skinned with blue or hazel eyes. Interesting but this is culturally based as I have also seen other more tanned versions of carpenter Jesus and slightly tanned version of Mary.
Thanks, I enjoyed responding to your valid and noteworthy points.skwills, actually I am only stating the fact about the main three religions, that they are authoritarian and their holy books have poetic phrasing that for the strict interpreters, the fundamentalist readers, there is room for misguided claims and misconceptions which result in conflict and tensions. This has been true in history, in politics and it is today.
These good religions in actuality are beautiful expressions of God and God’s love for humans with the need for humans to live good, honourable lives for serving God. Different people however, interpret scriptural writings and religion in different ways having specific intentions and agendas.
People may become defensive when in conflict with sound scientific claims that are repeatedly provable and reproducible so for some people it is best not to discuss science and religion and to debate it profusely. The differences must be accepted and onto the next issue. As for others who view science and religion as separate yet in some ways complementary; it is suitable to have mutual understandings affirmed and appreciated with cohesive respect.
The various religions other than the big three are also very good and they have their unifying purpose to have humans worship God and live good lives.ACTUALLY, Fundamentalists do allow for some parts of the Bible to be understood Poeticlaly, and aren’t so strict in terms of Literalism as to think the entire text must be 100% Literall all the Time. And I say Bible instead of Holy Books ebcause there is no such thing as a Muslim or Jewish Fundamentalist. Fundamentalism is a Protestant Christian Movement.I also dont htink Science and Relgiion are separate at all. The Truth is, its all just peopel tryign to figre out what is True and what isnt. The distinction is an artifice and Cultural Relic.Regarding religious fundamentalism, it does exist in religions of the world;  in the case of Islam, it may be referred to as Islamic radicalism.  In the case of Judaism, ” Jewish fundamentalism may refer to militant Religious Zionism or Ashkenazi or Sephardic Haredi Judaism. The term “fundamentalism” was originally used in reference to Christian fundamentalism but today commonly refers to the anti-modernist movements of any religion based on literal interpretation of religious scriptures.  ” (source: Wikipedia)Also from Wikipedia:  “In 1988, the University of Chicago, backed by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, launched The Fundamentalism Project, devoted to researching fundamentalism in the worlds major religions, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism. It defined fundamentalism as “approach, or set of strategies, by which beleaguered believers attempt to preserve their distinctive identity as a people or group … by a selective retrieval of doctrines, beliefs, and practices from a sacred past.” A 2013 study by Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin für Sozialforschung finds that Islamic fundamentalism is widespread among European Muslims with the majority saying religious rules are more important than civil laws and three quarters rejecting religious pluralism within Islam”. From Wikipedia: “The modern Islamic fundamentalist movements have their origins in the late 19th century.The Wahhabi movement, an Arabian fundamentalist movement that began in the 18th century, gained traction and spread during the 19th and 20th centuries” “The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and social theories, of the modern world have grown out of Greece and Rome—not by favour of, but in the teeth of, the fundamental teachings of early Christianity, to which science, art, and any serious occupation with the things of this world were alike despicable.”   This is a quote from Thomas Henry Huxley, ”    Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays”
When considering science, it is about explaining the natural world through a scientific empirical and evidence based lens. When considering religion, it is about explaining the non-physical world through a spiritual lens. While there is some overlap, it is simply a way of explaining our perceived reality at this time.Alan Braganza  ,This I feel is one of the gravest mistakes of our Time, misdefining terms to create shadow Villainy and false equivocations.Regarding religious fundamentalism, it does exist in religions of the world; in the case of Islam, it may be referred to as Islamic radicalism. In the case of Judaism, ” Jewish fundamentalism may refer to militant Religious Zionism or Ashkenazi or Sephardic Haredi Judaism. The term “fundamentalism” was originally used in reference to Christian fundamentalism but today commonly refers to the anti-modernist movements of any religion based on literal interpretation of religious scriptures. ” (source: Wikipedia)That’s all well and good but, think for a minuet. By using the term “Fundamentalist” to refer to any Anti-Modernist movement based on a Literal interpretation of Scriptures, and linking this with Radicalism, you  are basically saying a Fundamental Baptist Church is the same thing as an Islamic Terrorist. After all, they are both Anti-Modern and both tend to have Literalistic views of their respective Scriptures. However, a Fundamental Baptist in the United Sates is not a Terrorist. In fact, despite the fact that we always seem to think of Fundamentalists as hateful Bigots who are intolerant of anyone who doesn’t share their views and as strict, uncaring Authoritarians who seek only to impose their Religious Rules onto others and how have no compassion, only a set of rules to follow, the Truth is, many Fundamental Baptists, or members of other forms of Fundamentalist Christianity, can, and often are, tolerant of others who disagree, loving and supportive of their Friends and Neighbours, and often far more flexible in terms of Social order that they are given credit  for.This is why I reject the absurd notion that a Fundamentalist is anyone who we don’t like, and certainly don’t describe Islamic Radicals as Fundamentalists. Its unfair to actual Fundamentalists to just assume they are somehow moral equivalents. The term shouldn’t be given such negative connotations.Also from Wikipedia: “In 1988, the University of Chicago, backed by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, launched The Fundamentalism Project, devoted to researching fundamentalism in the worlds major religions, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism. It defined fundamentalism as “approach, or set of strategies, by which beleaguered believers attempt to preserve their distinctive identity as a people or group … by a selective retrieval of doctrines, beliefs, and practices from a sacred past.” A 2013 study by Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin für Sozialforschung finds that Islamic fundamentalism is widespread among European Muslims with the majority saying religious rules are more important than civil laws and three quarters rejecting religious pluralism within Islam”.I don’t care how they define the term, I still say its misguided to cast it in such a way.From Wikipedia: “The modern Islamic fundamentalist movements have their origins in the late 19th century.The Wahhabi movement, an Arabian fundamentalist movement that began in the 18th century, gained traction and spread during the 19th and 20th centuries”And this is still wrong. They are not Fundamentalists and by extending the word like this you make it loose meaning.“The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and social theories, of the modern world have grown out of Greece and Rome—not by favour of, but in the teeth of, the fundamental teachings of early Christianity, to which science, art, and any serious occupation with the things of this world were alike despicable.” This is a quote from Thomas Henry Huxley, ” Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays”Yeah this quote is meaningless. For one thing, when Huxley said “Fundamental teachings of early Christianity”, he wasn’t referring to Fundamentalism. Fundamentalism did not exist yet. He was referring to Christianity in general, using the term Fundamental to mean its basic core teachings, not to distinguish a Movement. He’s also promoting the Science VS Religion myth, which had recently been developed by John William Draper and  Andrew Dickson White. The Conflict Thesis has since been discredited by Historians, though it remains popular in broader cultural discussions. Still, the premise of his argument is wrong. Its been proven wrong.Just quoting Huxley doesn’t make him Right.When considering science, it is about explaining the natural world through a scientific empirical and evidence based lens. When considering religion, it is about explaining the non-physical world through a spiritual lens. While there is some overlap, it is simply a way of explaining our perceived reality at this time.This isn’t True either. Religion is not all about explaining the Non-Physical World. In fact, every Religion that has ever existed has offered explanations about the Physical World and how we live in it. This is an oversimplistic and erroneous view of what Religion is.These published quotes and accepted definitions of terms I gave that you persist in disagreeing with are valid quotes in my opinion. Huxley had his opinion as did many famous people quoting about such matters.
While your non acceptance of some of the points in the other quotes is your opinion, you have a right to your opinion, but it is to your limitation that you are unable to understand beyond your disagreement.  Your understanding of the term “fundamentalist” is still not as I think of it in part as “literal interpretation” which creates multiple interpretations based on who reads into the poetic writing.
People should not be denied or oppressed because of overt religious rules, for even spiritual people will follow what they believe in their respective religions. The same may be said of science and schools of thought where one explanatory belief may have a following different from a second school of thought.
The extremists and radicals are identified in history and today in their strict and unwavering rules that may not be shared by complementary religions or belief systems. Their inability to change their ideological views becomes not only their detriment but does inadvertently affect all society.
My comparison of how we see science and religion is a valid and true to fact comparison but you disagree. It is feeble to think of Religion in the same way as science. Religion in front of science is unable to explain the physical world with valid evidence as you claim. There have been so many divisions in religion historically because of differences of opinion.
Some religious claims supported by physical and scientific evidence is beautifully valid.
Arguably the submission of evidence by people professing to have suitable evidence some religious claims has been scrutinized and criticized as to validity and authenticity.
Every religion that HAS tried to explain the physical world without empirical and reproducible scientific evidence has been unable to validate their claims and so their claims are considered spiritual truths and belief truths as per their tenets, dogmas and doctrines. What I believe as religion and science today explaining our perceived reality at this time is true to fact and valid so I do not know why you are unable to accept that by saying it is erroneous.
For example, I have my beliefs in Roman Catholic faith but I am not overtly in disagreement that God has manifest Himself in other humans at other times to other people thus being in other religious faiths. I do not impose my religious views like the radicals and fundamentalist thinkers; rather I find equal solace and comfort in the explanations of science.
I have an open mind that provides enough reason to scrutinize how religions have diverged in disagreement and have come about to serve a following of people who choose to support it in many ways including financially.
I together with millions of people of various religious faiths do not like the radicals and extremists in every religion aforementioned especially in cults, for these closed minded radicals affect not only themselves but our entire society.
You have to agree that their existence is a detriment to society because their premise, their movements are non valid and their violence make terrible headlines that our police and governments are warring over both here in North America and overseas. Surely you do not make excuses for the radical religions or radicals who associate with a religion incorrectly just for their own agendas?Alan Braganza  ,These published quotes and accepted definitions of terms I gave that you persist in disagreeing with are valid quotes in my opinion. Valid Quotes maybe, but that in no way makes the points they raised, or that you raised, inherantly correct. This is especially True since you quoted them with no real reference to context. Tell me, have you read the actual works of Huxley or Adams? Do you understand what they were saying in full? Furthermore, why should I agree with them? Just quoting someone doesn’t mean you’ve proven your point no matter whom you quote.
To use an infamous and overused example, to highlight my point, if I quote Adolph Hitler on why the Jews are Evil, have I proven that the Jews are Evil?I don’t usually like Argument by Hitler but, in this case its just to make an extreme point stand out.The point is, you can’t prove something is True by merely quotign it. If you could,then I can quote Ptolomy and prove the Earth is the centre of the Universe, and can quotee aristotle and prove that four basic elements exist in Nature and all else is comprised of them.I can quote many respected Doctors from centuries ago, too, who told us about hwo the Body works on Humours and those Humours need to be balanced.Quoting someone from the past in no way makes their point True.Huxley had his opinion as did many famous people quoting about such matters.But just quoting someone is not an argument.It doesn’t prove they are Right.While your non acceptance of some of the points in the other quotes is your opinion, you have a right to your opinion, but it is to your limitation that you are unable to understand beyond your disagreement. This isn’t a very fair statement. You’ve basically said that if I reject these quotes as evidence then I don’t understand them. But, that means in order to demonstrate that I understand them I have to accept them as True.Why?I understand the quotes better than you do, as I’ve read the context, I just don’t care that Huxley or Adams said them. Sayign they are wrong is not the same thign as not beign able to see past my own opinions. However, insistign yoru Right because of these quotes does mean you can’t see past yours.Your understanding of the term “fundamentalist” is still not as I think of it in part as “literal interpretation” which creates multiple interpretations based on who reads into the poetic writing.
You also seem to think the entire Bible, or other Holy Books, are only Poetic, which I’d say is just as foolish as thinkign it entirely Literal.It’s not either-or.People should not be denied or oppressed because of overt religious rules, for even spiritual people will follow what they believe in their respective religions. At the same Time, in the name of Secularism we see oppression. No one here is arguing for Oppression but Oppresion doesnt come about more readily just because we brand certain beelifs to be religious, and Secular Ideals aren’t really better. In fact I’d sy they become a Religion in their own Right.I’d also like to note that one can be a Fundamentalist and be very open to new Ideas and tolerant of others, whilst oen can be very oppressive as a Liberal Secularist.The same may be said of science and schools of thought where one explanatory belief may have a following different from a second school of thought. Exactly. On this point we agree.The extremists and radicals are identified in history and today in their strict and unwavering rules that may not be shared by complementary religions or belief systems. Their inability to change their ideological views becomes not only their detriment but does inadvertently affect all society.This is simplistic. In fact, its wrong. Usually prohlems emerge precicely because of Change. Times of Change and reformation are the most unstable in a Society. Unchanging beleifs and rpactices, on the othe hand, can and usually are remarkably stable.My comparison of how we see science and religion is a valid and true to fact comparison but you disagree.
No, yorus isnt a valid and True to Fact comparrison, its a simplistic oen based on a false Paradigm. It is feeble to think of Religion in the same way as science.Why?Can you actually explain why? Religion in front of science is unable to explain the physical world with valid evidence as you claim.Why? Because you said so?Religion is not somethign umanity invented, and began without. Religion is nothing more than a product of Consciousness. Its the framework we use to udnerstand our existence. This Framework begins automatically based on our observations and eperiences. Religion thus naturlaly begins with what we opersonally observe and feel, and only gros viw Communication and second hand learning.Just because youthonk Religion is purley about the SUpernatural and beleivign in it with no evidence doens’t mean this is how Religious Studies operate, and certainly isnt how Religion is understood in Academia. Just read the entries about Religion in Britannica, The Stanford Encyclopedia Of Phiosophy, and on the University Of Cambridges Site, or even try Wikipedia.Religion is a notoriosuly fluid and difficult to pin down term. There have been so many divisions in religion historically because of differences of opinion. The same can be said of literally all Human endeavours, including Sceince. Politics, Philosophy, even Entertainment have this same problem.That only proves disagreement exists, it des not prove that Relgiion is beleif withotu evidence in a supernatural world only.Some religious claims supported by physical and scientific evidence is beautifully valid. Which means you have to admit that Religious CLaims can be so supported. All Im sayign si that the distinction ebtween Science and Religion is artificial to begin with and a cultural construct.Arguably the submission of evidence by people professing to have suitable evidence some religious claims has been scrutinized and criticized as to validity and authenticity.Not sure what you mean here, exactly.Every religion that HAS tried to explain the physical world without empirical and reproducible scientific evidence has been unable to validate their claims and so their claims are considered spiritual truths and belief truths as per their tenets, dogmas and doctrines. 
You do know that the Scientific Method and Empirisism are relatively new ideas, right?What I believe as religion and science today explaining our perceived reality at this time is true to fact and valid so I do not know why you are unable to accept that by saying it is erroneous.What Im sayign is rronous is the assumption that Relgiion is ourley abotu the Supernatural World, or that it is not connected to observed Reality.For example, I have my beliefs in Roman Catholic faith but I am not overtly in disagreement that God has manifest Himself in other humans at other times to other people thus being in other religious faiths.Which is what the Catholic Church teaches…You’d be a poor Catholic if you didnt beleive this.However, Catholics also beleive that God gave a Perfect Revelation to The Catholic Church herself, and the other Cultures have an imperfect, and sometimes erroneous, undersanding of God. I do not impose my religious views like the radicals and fundamentalist thinkers;This is the problem, not all, or even most, Fundamentalists actually try to force their beleifs oto others. Most Fundamentalists are actually tolerant of other beleifs. A Fundamentalist is simply someone who adheres to the Fundamental principles of their Faith, hence the term Fundamentalist. Being a Fundamentalist does not meean you seek to force yoru views onto others. rather I find equal solace and comfort in the explanations of science.I don’t even make a distinction ebtween Science and Religion.I have an open mind that provides enough reason to scrutinize how religions have diverged in disagreement and have come about to serve a following of people who choose to support it in many ways including financially.
I together with millions of people of various religious faiths do not like the radicals and extremists in every religion aforementioned especially in cults, for these closed minded radicals affect not only themselves but our entire society. But in an earlier post you mentioned Creationists as a danger. Most Creationists pose no real threat to anyone though.You have to agree that their existence is a detriment to society because their premise, their movements are non valid and their violence make terrible headlines that our police and governments are warring over both here in North America and overseas. Surely you do not make excuses for the radical religions or radicals who associate with a religion incorrectly just for their own agendas?I dont think being a Fundamentalist makes you Violent.There is a difference.skwills,
You say you do not make a distinction between science and religion. There is significant distinction between religion and science because they are different.You say being a Fundamentalist does not imply becoming violent …unless authoritarian consequences are given as punishment for disobedience by followers of their faith. For instance, radical fundamentalists such as the Islamic radicals are killing and destroying historic sites in the Middle East with their abominated version of Islam. This is abhorrent and should stop. The same may be said of the radicals who use their religions as a conduit for their destructive agendas. This is what dangerous religious fundamentalism does in the minds of some people. Creationists by comparison appear harmless and their example was given to compare how people explain the age of the Earth.
Religion is in my opinion a guide to live a good life in society and with others a way to honour God yet it is rooted in historical figures and in supernatural occurrences. There is nothing new revealed to humans by God only that what is celebrated cyclically and repeatedly renewed. Does religious study measure and provide new insights that add to humanity? It is a measure of virtuous practice and following religious values that add to and improve humanity.
Good people living good lives in the context of sound scientific principles add to the benefit of society and improve it. This is what must happen and in the name of positive beliefs and progress.THE Difference between Science and Religion is imagenary. Its a culturally created construct. In te end its just about what we beleive and why, not abotu absolute thigns liek “Science” or “Relgiion”, neither of which actually exist. As for Fundamentalism, it is defined as folowign the Fundamental tenets of the Protestant Christian Faith. It’s not all about Authoritrianism and it isnt about oppressing others who disagree. Thats assumed because we use the term Fundamentalist as a pejorative these days, but tis not inherant in what Fundamentalism is.And again, the Radical Islamists are not actually Fundamentalists. We call them that only because we see Fundamentalism as bad first, then ascribe it to them. Actual Fundamentlaism, however, is not about forcign others into your beeigfs or oppressing them.Also,plenty of morn Philosophers and Theologians do, in fact, offer new insights and reevaluate RelgiiosuTeaching. Like Science, Relgiion evovles over Time.Here is a quote from the famous Carl Sagan who writes, ” “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.”
―     Carl Sagan,     The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark”Sagan also said this.“Life is but a momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astonishing universe, and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fantasy.” And this.“In many cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing. But this is mere temporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must, of course ask next where God comes from? And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed? ”By Spirituality, Sagan means a sort of Awe or sense of meaning or Grandeur that can make us feel connected to the Universe or feel personally fulfilled, he did not mean Religion, which to him was wrong.Sagan adhered to the Myth of Science VS Religion, and was himself often wrong.Thank you very much for your insights which have made me think about some of my assertions and understandings.You are welcome.Um. You can’t reconcile your religious beliefs with your scientific beliefs? No offense, but that means you haven’t made up your mind. Is the world 6000 years old or 13.8 billion years old?Your problem is that you have been indoctrinated and you can’t realize that Christianity is just man-made mythology. You actually are trying to fuse a fairy-tale and reality. I don’t mean to be offensive, but you’re playing both sides of the fence because you are a coward who is afraid of ‘hell’. You have been indoctrinated with the fear of God and it’s tough for you to see through the veils of bullshit that have been fed to you since you were born. If Jesus was born in Palestine (Bethlehem), why does he look like a white, Northern European? Because its a European, man-made, human-controlling, load of nonsense. It’s not European in origin.  The white Jesus is just the most known to us because of Western art but the Byzantines depicted him differently, as did the Coptic Christians.  For the record I’m an atheist.In the name of Christianity, there was conquering and colonialism on a global scale. Many modern day Christians and Roman Catholics now choose not to follow and practice their religion as actively as they once may have and choose to be part of a non practicing collective.The bible really doesn’t say 6000 years by the way. Maybe you’ve been too indoctrinated by pseudo atheist bible haters. lol You are generally right about it as a control method.Agreed, it is much in part marketing of a commodity to persuade the masses with promise of great returns. Jesus would look mid eastern/Palestinian with likely brown to dark brown eyes and darker skin.Somehow it exposes the closed mindedness of events of religious history which led to death of the implicated. The Inquisitors were arrogant and proud, unyielding control minded authoritarians.
Many intellectuals were supressed and oppressed; many open minded and free thinkers were burned at the stake. These times were the Christian Dark Ages and during the Christian Dark Ages Humanity did not advance as in the Greek and Roman Ages prior; rather in the Christian Dark Ages because of the power and control of the Church, Humanity regressed. Humanity went backwards and there was no progress in science until The Renaissance.
The missionaries that the Church sent to convert after colonization of foreign lands were sent to gain more followers and more wealth in the form of pillaged or stolen precious metals and gold for Europe. Just look at the churches and palaces of Europe.
Colonialism was conquering at any cost.And then God said “Let there be light” and the entire universe was born.“Any “scientist” who attempts to ascribe the process of evolution or the existence of the physical universe to a supernatural creator is at best a fool and at worst a humbug.”
So a scientist who ascribes to the Big Bang theory is a fool?Actually the Big Bang Theory does not posit a cause for the big bang, just states, with the available evidence that the universe as we know it came into existance 14 billion years ago through an explosion at a point of singularity from which the universe seems to be expanding.No supernatural being, just statements based on current available evidencei believe sciene and religon could work better to getherScience does not need religion.  Mankind doesn’t need religion.  It does not answer any questions, it only asks us to believe without proof which is contrary to modern thought.o.k 1. that’s not exactly true look at the allignment of the planets and the sizes everything is in the perfect place and the ideal size you expect me to believe that’s an accident i just can’t if that offends you than you need to learn to settle down and every peice of biblical prophecy is coming true and even nasa is saying something the bible said would happen on the end of days 4 blood moons with a solar eclipse in the midddle. 2. stephen hawking asks you to not believe in something without any real proof so it’s o.k for him cause he’s a genius. look i don’t care what you believe so thank you for your kind words:) and have a happy life wish all your dreams come true.1.  What are you talking about?  The alignment of the planets?  The only one that’s “perfect” is Earth because it’s the right distance out for life to be possible, but given the billions of galaxies and billions of stars in each that’s bound to happen occasionally.  2.  Not exactly.  The difference is that when a better explanation comes along we discard the old one.  Religion doesn’t allow that.yeah that’s what i meant but still earth is the perfect size to have an atmosphere 2. thanks for clearing that up for me but we all put faith in something science religon etc. and stephen hawkings probaly an atheist because he’s angry and bitter (it’s pretty clear) but i don’t know so it’s not fair for me too judgeHawking doesn’t seem angry and bitter, though if he was a more likely culprit would be his condition and not his atheism.Science and faith do not go together.  Part of the whole appeal of it is that you know why you believe it – experiments prove the answers are real.o.k that was my point that hawkings if he is angry it’s cause of his condition but look if a man is smart and can cure a disease than why should not he be allowed to work in a lab but firing scientists for being basically agnostic is wrong i’m sure you believe that too but supercolliders leaving debris does not prove anything and their are failed evoloution experiments and it’s still a theory not a fact but i know i believe what i do and you yours so bye and have a great day sirWhat you said was:and stephen hawkings probaly an atheist because he’s angry and bitter (it’s pretty clear)The rest of what you said is just a rambling, run-on mess.i’m sorry that’s not what i meant i’ll try to do better look just do one thing  look up some names of christian converts brittni runz danny wallace i believe was his name. i’m not trying to ‘save’ you just want you to see these peoples stories and there’s a lot of others you can. (you don’t have too i just think it could be an interesting thing for you too see)Religion isnt an absolute thing. Relgiion itslf doesnt have any Dogmas or Docgriens it can sk you to beelvie. I think you mean :Christianity”, but weven then you are wrong. Christanity doednt ask you to beleive anythign withotu eviedence.As for Mankind not needign Relgiion, well, any Phlosophy you device is Religion. Even Athiestic beleif systems are.It’s funny how religious people are confronted with reality and they need science to proof their religion. The problem is that science don’t need religion. In fact religion is the lack of knowledge of the ancient people. They used god for the hardest scientific answers. But in today’s society god is small. The more the science answer the truth about our Cosmos the small becomes god. That why god this days is the god of  the gaps and that’s why we no need god or religion in science. Religion just shuts down rational thinking and dismiss science.I want to see the archetype of “God” finally entered into the realm of accepted science. Surely being that seeded life on earth would qualify as one that fits the archetype we have. Or perhaps the archetype grew in the human psyche because of “leaders” pretending to be god and enslaving their fellow man.I diagree with the both of you, with no intended insult.Faith is not beelif withotu evidence and FReligion is not somethign distinct from Science. In truth, Science, Philosophy, and Religion are all the same thing. In the end, Religion is nothign mroe than what we beleif abotu who we are, where we came from and the ultimatemeanign of our existence. Science isnt chosen over Religion, nd can be, for his makes Sicnece into Religion.I see no incompatibility with beelif that God exists, and created us, and modern Science, they ae from a Psychological stance just ideas, as is Creationism.Whiel I am not a creationist, I knwo that Creationism is true to those who beleive in it in the same way Evolution is true for those who accep it, and in the end its just us tryign to make sense of our world.I find arguments overit or attemots at selective categorisation mroe flawed than anything else.The kind of faith we’re talking about here, religious faith, is indeed defined as belief without evidence.Religion is a cultural practice more distinct from science than any other thing.You’re trying to confuse the answers to questions with the method of coming up with those answers. Religious leaders and scientists can both answer deep questions. That doesn’t make the practice of religion similar in any way with the methods of science.Evolution is true whether you accept it or not, that’s part of the difference between science and religion!Religious Faith is not defined as Beleif without evidence. I know your own “Not-A-Religion” dictates that you define it that way as many of your arguments agaisnt Religion rest on how Irrational Religion is and how no evidence exists in Religion, but had it dawned on yo that your “Not-a-Religion” may be wrong?The Westminster Dictionary Of Theological Terms defines Faith as Trust or Confidence in the Teachings of a Relgiion, or in God, and makes no mention of this beign given without any evidence. The idea that Religious Faith is, indeed, beleif withotu Evidence is unsupported.In other words, you have no Evidence that the Relgiious Definition of Faith is beleif withotu Evidence.Just like you have no evidence that Relgiion is the thign the least like Science. The Truth is, you’re just spoputing the shallow Dogmas of Militant Ateism, which Ironically is itself a Religion. You’re the same kind of mindless Fundamentalist you like to mock and berate.Relgiion is not distinct from Science and totally dissimilar to it, Religiosu Faigh is not beleif without evidence, and your claism about Relgiion and Methodology dont’ make any sene. I nevr said that Answrs and the ways you coem to answrs were the same thing, but Relgiion has no set Methoology vo how Answers are arrived at. What you don’t understand is that Relgiiosu Answers arent all just invented and passed down.With that said, I am not a Creationist, and I can easily say “God exists if yo beleif in him or not” and have the same impact. It’s also a stupid thign to contrast Science to Relgiion usign that Line. Religion doesnt teahc that Relgiionsi only True if you beleive in it, so it works the same way Science does,based on the idea that its Trachigns are True Regardless.Of coruse all this ausmes “Relgiion” is this oen thing, which its not. Relgiion doesnt exist. Religion is a blanket term which covers multiple beleif systems. But you’re too lazy to really understand that.Religious faith is indeed belief without evidence, and many religious people over hundreds of years have prided themselves on believing without seeing.  There is no evidence of any kind to support the beliefs of any religion, not just Christianity.  None at all.Actually, Relgiion is not a singlualr thign and doesnt defien any terms. the idea that all Relgiiosn define faith as beleif withotu evidence is just bunk.I can even prove it. if belief Withotu Evidence  was the Relgiiosu Definition Of Faith, then htis is how the word woul be explicitly defined in Religious Dictionaries. Yet The Westminster Dictionary of theological terms doesnot define Faith as beleivign oin soemthign without evidence, but rather as trust in or loyalty to god, or a set of principles, or to another person.Given that The Westminster Dictioanry of Religious terms is an actual Theological Dictionay composed by Christuans form multiple denominations, and never ocne defines faith as beleif withotu evidence, why shoudl i accept that this is the Religiosu Defimnition of Faith used by Christians? And if its not the Relgiiosu Definition fo Faith used by Christians, why shoudl i accept any other Religion defines it that way?I keep hearign form Anti-Religiosdu Atheists liek you that Religion defines faith as beleif withotu evidence, btu wbat evidence do you hav of this? a qote out fo context fromt he Bibel liek Hebrews 11:1 which actalky doesnt say this?By the aay, there is evidence supportign Chridtian claims, and the “Absioltuely no evidence: routien gets old. pick up a boomk by an actual acaemic.The definition in The Westminster Dictionary of Religious Terms is in agreement with what I said.  Virtually every dictionary defines “faith” the same way, along the lines of:  “complete trust or confidence in someone or something.”  So, what does that amount to?  Believing in what your religion tells you – and they all say, basically, that how anything works isn’t your business, that God did it.  That’s why it means believing without evidence.  Understand now?You see, this is why talkign to a New Atheist becomes tedious. You :know” that all Relgiion says Faith is beleif withotu evidence, and “know” relgiion says :God did it”. Well, yoru wrong. I’m sorry but, what you’r sayign is oure drivel. Religions do nto all Universlsly tell you to just beleive whatever yru Relgiion eaches you withotu question, nro do all Relgiions tell you to never loo for futher ansers and jus beleive, That is how idiitoic New Atheists such as yoruself decpit “Relgiion’, its not hwo it actually is. Even the infamous “God did it” arugment is not actually used y Theologians, it is primarily a caricature invented by Militant Atheidts.If you cannot answer what peopel actlaly ebelive or what Relgion acally is, then yoru arugments arent valid.Religions do tell you what to believe.  Christianity says what you must believe in order to be “saved.”  Can you be a Christian and not believe in Jesus?  No.  The Bible itself is full of the things you must believe, and different Christian groups have more (and varying) additional rules.Religions, especially Christianity, do tell you to look no further because all the answers are supposed to be there.  In the Bible.  You’ve said it yourself when I asked what “deep questions” it had the answers to, and you said “all of them.”  So, why is there any need to look further?“God did it” is in fact what it boils down to.  God is responsible for creating everything, and the Bible tells you what you need to know to reach Paradise, what else do you need?Lt me break this down as I know you are slow.There is no such thing as Religion. The term “Religion” is applied to many different beleif systems who do not all share the same definitions of owrds or core concepts. it’s ntolike all the worlds Religions are just facets of this one big thing calledd Religion.With that said, what you’re saying still makes no sense. While it is true that you have to beleie certain things to be a Christian, Christianity itself is a spectrum with no single beleif beign shared by all Christians, and even then, Christianity itself is not built on the concept of tellign you to just beleive what Christian leaders tell you and don’t seek any other answers about any other topic.Ni Christian Group that I know of actually says that Literally all answers to any question you may have abotu any topic is all right there in the Bible. You’re an idiot if you think they do. Peopel do not learn mathematics from the Bible, nor do they learn European or American History, or Astronomy. Most Protestant Churches actually teach that the Bible is the sole basis for matters of Doctrine in terms of Christianity itself, not that the Bibel contaisn all knwoeldge or that you need not seek any additional knowledge tuside of the Bible. In fact, many Christian Curches have build Universities, some with Research labs, in order to teach things we don’t find in the Bible. Vanderbilt, Wesleyan, Notre Dame, Geortetown, heck, even Cambridge and oxford, all Christian Universities, and all teach far mroe than just “beleif the Bible’.The situaton becoems worse when you consider that ROman Catholics don’t even think the Bible is the sle basis for all aspects of their Faith, and see the Bible as only a part of the Catholic Faith, a;ong with Sacred tradition and the rulings of the Majesteria. it’s uttelry impossible to look at the Catholic Curhc and see a “Bible is the only thing you need’ mentality giventhat the Catholic Churhc outright condemns Sola Scriptura as a heresy.The fact is, what tiu’re presentign is a caricature of Christianity, base don a need to see Relgiion, especially Christainity, as hindeign Science and Growth, but it does not reflect the Reality at all.Also, you pretty well lied abitu me. I did not say the Bible answered all deep questions, I said Religion did. Relgion is not a synonym for The Bible.As for “god did it is what it boils don to”. no, its not, thats an oversimplified Caricature itself that has no basis in fact either.You poor fool.  What I’m saying makes no sense to you because you are an exceptionally stupid person.  You know this.  Please stop embarrassing yourself!if this is the best you can do as a reply, then you basiclaly backhandedly admit that I am Right.Obviously it isn’t.  I’ve effortlessly refuted every point you’ve made.  Just go back and re-read them.  I see no point in continuing to do so myself.Actually you didnt. Most of the Tiem you just said i was wrong and left it at that, and a few Times you even claiemd I was wrogn when I idnt say something. EG, I said you were Religious and that beign an Atheist did not make you nonreligious. ou contradicted me by sayign Athism is not a Religion. When I pointed out that I never said that Atheism was a Religion, you said I did then quoted me, but the quote did nt say Athism was a Religion.You haven’t refuted any point I made, you jut say Im wrogn and declae yoruself right wile callgn me stupid.Everything you just said is wrong.  The proof is there in those past comments.  I suggest you read them.  I can’t imagine anyone else is interested, but anyone who is can do the same.The trpble i, anyien who reads them will see the opposite. Thuis is jus a way for you to duck out and save fsxce by not havign to admit you mae mistakes.What “deep questions” does religion answer?All of them, which is the poitn of Religion.Which ones specifically?Before I begin, I know Google defines Religion as beelfi in andreverence of Gods and Spernatural Powers. Google is wrong. And Google is not the sole exclusive Authority.Religion is a term we use for the beleif systems we hodl to that explains the world we live in, where it came from, what its natue is, and what, if any, meanign it has, as well as how we shoudl live. This is why even “Non-Religious Ohilosoophies” like Secular Humanism are, in fact, Religions themselves.Relgiion is relaly just aActive Philosophny.It doesnt have a specific objective or question it answers. The term “Relgiion” is generalised.Try any dictionary.  The wording will vary only slightly, the meaning will be the same.  You don’t know what philosophy is.Philosophy, from the Greek meaning Love Of truth,. it is the disiplin of applying thouht to questiosn regardng ou existence in the hopes of resolving those wuestions.Religion is a set of beelifs about the nature of our existence, concerned with ansiwrgn the ultimate questiosn such as our origins, end, and purpose.I’m sorry but, they have similar or the same definitions. The distinction exists only becaue people liek you hate Religion but like Philoophy, so imagine the separation.I don’t recall saying I liked philosophy, but anyway you’re wrong.  The definition of philosophy has changed over the centuries since the ancient Greeks and no longer means that.  Just like we now use the word scientist instead of natural philosopher.  Even the Greeks never really used it the way you assume.  This is partly why Socrates was prosecuted for impiety.You’ve just illustrated another porblem in the neo-Atheist community. The “Me me me’ atitude. I never said you liked Philosphy, but the colleive Affiliation you hodl to developed from peopl who did, and in the end you’re not relaly thinkign for yoruself but repeatin idas fom others, that you dint even know the Hstory of.By the way the term definitions I uzed came form modern Dictionaries…I’m nto usign Ancient dfinitions but modern ones.Agreed, religion and the Church has historically always vied for control of people through persuasion, guilt and obligation in a sense oppression of the massesAnd your evidence for this is…what exactly?Do you really believe that Vatican is less knowledgeable in cosmology than the modern science ? In the other hand ,do you really believe that modern science is not a dogma ?Follow the wise words of first one to postulate the ideas of the Big Bang, Prof. Georges Lemaitre. He used to say that both science and religion can co-exist in your mind as two parallel and incompatible interpretations of the universe. Eventually, there is a chance religion will fade away. In my case, I was raised catholic and during high school I had completely rejected christian religion as something irrelevant, superfluous, demeaning, childish and, of course, incompatible with science. We do not need religion for absolutely anything.We?  Would it not be more correct that you and many others do not need religion for absolutely anything.  Many others would say the opposite. I like this quote from Lemaitre:
“As far as I can see, such a theory remains entirely outside any metaphysical or religious question. It leaves the materialist free to deny any transcendental Being… For the believer, it removes any attempt at familiarity with God… It is consonant with Isaiah speaking of the hidden God, hidden even in the beginning of the universe.”
So, the materialists, skeptics & atheists should all be free to deny the existence of a deity. I celebrate that and find that I learn much from such a perspective.  I hope they, in turn, would allow me the freedom to be a theist (even if it means leaving me at peace in my supposed illusion).You are right. I should have said “If you reason you will realize that we do not apply religion for anything or religion is superfluous.” I am might be wrong, but when you go through any kind of transcendental and awe-inspiring moment, it does not make this moment better if you think that “god” did that for you. I think it is just childish, but you can be at peace with your illusion. However, the reality is that bullish, nonsense, stupid religion still keep being spread like viruses to children. Just keep to yourself, do not tell them to do good because then they will go to heaven or assume a position of submission to something that has not proven to exist. Let them decide that and maybe they will realize “Oh look, how stupid are those people wasting time praying for nothing, thinking about heaven/hell/angel/miracles. Well, I am not going to do that.”well said, Jerry.lemaiftre actuaky was a jesuituntil he died, and even though you claim to not need Relgiion, the truth is, you stkll have a Relgiion. beign an Atheist doesnt make you nonreligious, and sayign yo beleive in Science is just renamng yoru Religion something else.Atheist is the lack of belief in supernatural entities and associated organized religious dogmas, period. Science is all about explain the natural world (i.e., the only one:)) using falsifiable hypothesis, experimentation, measurements, empirical research. More importantly, scientific theories get superseded by others without any issues. Religion is based on unproven dogmas, faith (believe without evidences), revelation, prayers, all bullshit, crap, meaningless.Atheism is not the lack of beleif in the supernatural and in Relgiiosu EDogmas. Aheism is the belif that there are no gods. While it is True that most Atheists in the Modern World ae Materialists who reject the existence of the Supernatural, the term “Atheist” is defined as the beleif that thre are no gods, and has no real reference to either Religion or to the Supernatural.Atheism is also a beleif rather than a lack of belief.Science is also not limited to the Natural World, Science is acually a method of inquerry. Science is the aplication of a set Sc9entific Method to any given observed Phoenomenon.If the Supernatural exited and coudl be observed, then one coudl apply the Scientific method to it.Faith is not beleiving somethign withotu evidence, either,. Faith comes from the Latin word Fidese and axtually means Trust or Confidence in a given proposition. While it may be popular for Militant Atheists to define Faith as beleivign in somethign without Evidence, this has never been the actual definition usd by most people, nro is it “The Religiosu definition of Faith”. No Religious Dictionary defines it that way.Rekifion itself is nothign mroe than an active, applied Ohilosophy that explains the world we live in.The claims you make are just propaganda foisted by Contemproary Ah4ist whoo think they can create a clesr deliniation ebtween their Atheism, backed by Ratioanlity and Sicnece, and Relgiion, whcuib sui all made up crap, but the Truth is, yioru “Atheism’ is not mere Atheism, its mroe of a Humanism, and you have as many presuppositions and dogmas as any other Relgiion wuld. Yoru own ebelfis are, in fact, a form fo Relgiion, though oen that says Relgiion si bad and isnsits yoru beleifs arent Relgiion.By the way, Religiosu beelifs also change over Time, both in ters of individual beelifs, and in terms of what is taught formally by Religiosu Orignisatins. Also, Science is as flld with stubon refusals of new ideas and rejection fo Facts tjhat dotn suit Theories peopel beelive in, because its also run by Humans with the same flaws.The Scienc VS Relgiion claim si a Myth, liek the idea of Atheism beign linked to Rationality.Stop writing rubbish. Science is built on falsifiable hypothesis and “god”, whatever that crap means, is not one.
Atheism is the lack of belief on supernatural entities. Just like you is atheist with respect god Zeus, I am atheist with respect all gods.” If the Supernatural exited and coudl be observed, then one coudl apply the Scientific method to it.” – There is no such thing as supernatural or paranormal, there is only natural and normal.” the idea of Atheism beign linked to Rationality.” – Who said Atheism is linked to rationality or science? There is no evidence for gods, then I am atheist. There is no evidences for unicorn, I am an a-unicorn, etc.You have a poor writing and reasoning. I rest my case.I didn’t write rbbish, you did. Look at Atheism. You’r sayign its lack of beelif in supernatural beigns. Well, thats bunk. The term is derived from A, meaning without, and Theos, meaning god, so an Atheist is one wthout a god. It is not about the Supernatural at all, and, again, while most modern Atheists do in fact reject the existence of the Supernatural, that still does not alter the specific definition of the term. An Atheist is one who beleives there are no gods. Atheism is also not a lakc ofbeleif as is evidenced by the mere fact that too many Atheists say God does nto exist, which is an assertion fo fact that God does not exist and hence an expression of a beleif that God does not exist.Also, it is God, cap G, because its used as a name.As to your assertion that there is no such thign as the Supernatural or paranormal, only the natural and Normal, this proves my point. You are assertign eelifs, not lack of beelifs.It’s also rather missing the point. If the only Reason Science can be applied exclusively tot he natural World is because the natural World is all that exists, this still doesnt mean Science cudlnt be applied to the Supernatural if it existed. The only thing that limits Science tot he natural World woudl be the nonexistence fo anythgin else.It’s not inherant in Science to be so limited.By the way, your beign gdogmatic in oru assertion that the Supernatural doesnt exist. You don’t have evidence that the  atural World is all that exists, thisis just a tenet of your own Religion, and one you demand we all confirm to. Is that relaly better than the “Religious people” you critisise?By the way, I’m dyslexic.Also, can the “No evidence” routine. You arent an Atheist becaue there is no evidcne for God, you juyst repeat that mantra. There actually is eviddence for god’s exitence which can be foudn readily on Stanfords website, ro any othe acadmeic oen dealign in Philosophy. The ”
No evidence’ Routine is just bunk itself.Actually is “god”, just like “unicorn”, “flying spaghetti monster”.
Again, there is no evidence for “god”, just like there is no evidence for jesus (I am talking about the x-men that was crucified but did not die. I wonder if the crucifixion was lame), ETs, spiritis, that elvis is still alive,etc…Jesus did die in Christianity, though, he is sai to have returned to life but he did die.That said, again, drop the “no evidence’ routine, and for that amtter the “Flyign sphagetti monster”. These assertiosn only further prove that you are a dogmatic fundamentalist who refuses to even consider the possibility that tyou may be wrong about anything and also cements the cast that youre not Rational at all and just pushign a Polemic.Insultign Jesus by callign him an X Man in order to try to depict beelif in him as absurd, comparign god to Unicorns, spellign god in lower case becsue golly gee willigers I lack ebelfi in him, its all just stupid.God is spelled with a Capital G because God is sued as a name, mockery of Jesus is not evidence of anyhign but yoru own closed mondedness, and the fact that you won’t spend five minuets lookign upp the argumnts peopel make to defend beelfi in God, other than the strawman versiosn on Atheist websites, and can only repeatt he mantra of “No evidence’ really only serves to prove how you are nothign mroe than a parrot blidnly repeatign nonsense that you picked up.Ok. Seriously. Do you know the difference between jesus and a picture of jesus? You only one nail to hang a picture of jesus.
I am sorry, but I have to ridicule you since you treat evidences as mantra. Observation, experimentation, measurement are what I use as evidences. And I follow the evidences where they lead without making up stories for things that are unknown. “god” is nothing, meaningless, useless, etc. Now, go pray to avoid ethernal hell.I’m not Treatign evidence as Mantra. You haven’t presented evidence for anythign you’ve claimed, though, all you’ve done is declared yoruself Right. This includes declarign yoruself Right on things that are demonstratably wrong.I’ve made few assertions and the bulk of my post is a refutation of what you hve specifically said.You didnt use Observation, mesurement, and experimentation to come up wuith the Flyifn Sphage3tti Monster crap, and you won’t even take a few minuets to parous Argumnts for God’s existence on Philosophical sites in order to see if they ever employ evidence. Declarign that peopel whop beleive in God never have evidence is itself a falsifiable claim, and one that if subjected to any kidn of inquerry collapses.You can’t even spell God wih a cap G, or whtotu scare qores.face reality, all this talk fo Evidence and Observation is propaganda. You’re just repeatgn the party Lien of the nauveu Atheists.Where are your evidences for “god”?There are no evidences for “god”. I argue for evidence existign for God. If you have o intentionally sopell “god” wrong, why should I repeat myself?By the way, I say reopeat myself as I already gave one soruce.Say God, with a cap G and no quotes, then I’ll tell you.After all, its more trouble hittign the shift key twice than once.There are no evidences for any kind of any kind of god; the abrahamic god, zeus, thor, khrsisna. Good luck trying to prove that.You’ve just proven my point. You can’t even bring yourself to do somethign simple, liek spell God properly, without quotations.Your Atheism is not based on Reason and evidence, and you dont reject God’s existance because of a lack of evidence. It’s baed on the emrbace of your own Religion, which you hold to mainly to give yoruself a sense of self worth at the expence of Theists.You don’t want evidence, you just want me to say somethign you can shoot down. Even if your countrargument is utterly Irrational, you’d see it as proof positive that what I said was false.You just can’t admit you’r wrong.Where is your evidence for god? You are stupid to realize that god is used as lowercase to refer to a category of worshiped supernatural entities.Actually your the stupid one here. While it is True that the word god is not used as a name all the Time, and thus not capitalised all the Time, if you use the term as if it is a name to refer to a specific entity, then it is a name. This includes asking for evidence for god’s existence. You see, you are addressing a specific entity, and calling said entity god. Leaving god in lower case is thus poor grammar because you aren’t speaking of the gods, or a god, but specifically about God. So, as I said before, there is no evidence for the existence of god, but there is evidence for the existence of God. aSpell it properly and I’ll tell you where.Where is the evidence for the Monkey God?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkVPRKnLg4kSo, you will spell Monkey God with capitals and not god? That alone proves a point.By the way, arguign by usign a Seth McFarlane Cartoon is just nonsense. This is’t an argumnt, tis a caricature. What next? The clip where Stewie tells Brian the eorld they landed in is mroe advanced becsause Christianiy mnever existed to create The Dark Ages?Come on, you need real evidence, not ridicukous and innaccurate caricatures.Dude, you are really taking my answers seriously. Have you not noticed I am being sarcastic? I do not care about the evidences for Yahweh, Brahma, Jupiter, Zeus, etc because they were all fabricated by our not-so-fertile imagination. Have a nice one.if you dont care, then hy are you pstign here?For that matter, you’ve just confessed to being an Ideolouge whose more interested in promotign yoru views and who doesnt care about the Truth. If you reject evidence, or flat dont care abotu Evidence, then you aren’t tryign to arrive at Truth, just promote yiour own views as Truth regardless of the Facts.Can you even prove that all the gods in Hisotry eere fabruicated by peopels not so fertile Imaginations?Of coruse not. Its just a conceit of yous. You cant even brign yoruself to aee them as Imaginitive. Relgiion to you is Theism, and all Relgiion is bad, and inferior. it snot even allowed to be Imaginitive.Given that, isn’t it abotu Tiem you admit that yoru baises cloud yoru judgement?i think there are some that accept that but don’t worry the hypocrytical jackals will die out but we’ll surviveI’m a bit skeptical about this mutual respect you claim to have for each other.  Most likely you’ve all just acknowledged the futility of discussing it.I know the political power structure, internationally too, and I must say that the term climate change being synonymous with global warming is outright preposterous. The people in the USA ( a long list of politicians and cronies) Including white house science czar John P. Holdren. and dozens of others… These are the people who called for the deaths of edward snowden, julian assange, and others. Many of you can’t separate out the cult of personality and the barrage of propaganda and consensus reality you’ve been fed. I am quite tired of people believing the lies of the state run media and never listening to any of the politicians speeches. If people know the political power structure and had been watching for statements from each of our higher ups in the white house- they might have a better understanding of just how big the insiders club is.Our society has so many different belief systems that we are enriched by association and through appreciation of one another knowing respectful  boundaries and keeping conversations meaningful is really good practice.
It is about engaging good conversation and keeping things light as they need to be or as profound as they need to be providing at the end the person feels like they contributed something worthwhile and perhaps there was some mutual benefit to understanding.Really great blog post. Thanks so much for balancing the nuance of Bruno. I was particularly struck by his story and like most people in history it appears that he is just as complicated as all of us. It is very interesting that this was one of eight charges that the church leveled against him. It would have been good for Cosmos to mention that he also created theological waves as it did tend to make it look like the church was reacting to his scientific innovation. Burning him at the stake even for theological differences is obviously a tragedy and a shame on the church either way. I hadn’t even heard of Diggs until this post, so again well done!Corey,I’m calling you a religious apologist. You talk about “both sides” as though theists and scientists can meet somewhere in the middle. That just isn’t so. You said it yourself, Sagan had zero tolerance for theism.Right, Bruno was not executed primarily for believing other stars are suns. However, Bruno’s Copernican worldview in general, sophisticated or not, played a significant role in his execution. In any case, I think he was chosen as the hero for this episode primarily because of that belief. It might have also had to do with this quote credited to him:“Reject antiquity, tradition, faith, and authority. Let us begin anew by doubting everything we assume has been proven.”Where in the episode was it asserted that Bruno was the “one man” whose ideas went beyond those of Copernicus. I seem to have missed that part.Keep in mind this is a television show with a cartoon representation of an historical figure. I don’t know what more you expect in terms of realism. What, specifically, would you have changed about the animation or script?For example, I wouldn’t have shown all those medieval torture devices. That’s an appeal to disgust and is unnecessary.I enjoy engaging in conversation, but not about issues that are addressed directly in my original post. Please read it; it’s not that long.I have read it. I can’t imagine what might have given you the impression that I haven’t.Look at the equivalent section of the first episode of the original Cosmos for a beautiful example. In that section, Sagan visits a recreation of the library at Alexandria, meditates on all the knowledge lost and how much we have gained by the fragments that survived. It is sweeping, optimistic, honest, emotional; it conveys the idea of science as a huge, cumulative endeavor.Focusing on Bruno loses that magic in two key ways. It presents a kind of hero worship which is contrary to the spirit of the original Cosmos (and to Tyson’s closing message). And it requires turning Bruno into a largely fictional figure: He was not the first to recognize the infinite hiding in Copernicus’s model, he was not a lone wolf, and unlike Galileo his battle with the Church was largely one of theology, not science. I’m not here to tell the producers how to make their show, but since you ask… The Bruno section is very long; I didn’t clock it but it seems about 10 minutes, which is huge in the TV world. That much time could have yielded a beautiful animated sequence of Kepler, Bruno, Digges, and Gilbert (for instance) each wrestling with the Copernican worldview and seeking their wildly divergent paths in advancing understanding and rolling back dogma.I agree that the original episode’s segment on the library of Alexandria is a more sweeping and honest. I don’t agree that it’s more optimistic and emotional. I don’t like martyrdom but it is more emotional. I don’t see a difference in optimism between the two stories. Both are tragic losses that we hope will not occur in the future. I agree that the library conveys the idea of science as an huge, cumulative endeavor; that’s a great point. I hope they mention it in future episodes!I think the hero worship is effective in keeping the movie-magic. You may be right that this isn’t in keeping with the original message of Cosmos. You’ve convinced me that they overdid it.I’ve already agreed the portrait is incomplete. But I don’t think you can quite call it fictional, since the character spoke Bruno’s actual words. Again, it’s a little close to pedantry to criticize a literal cartoon for being less than accurate.I would sincerely enjoy reading your 10-minute-long screenplay that involved these four important figures. You should write it!“And it requires turning Bruno into a largely fictional figure ”
Exactly, except Corey is too much of a gentleman to put it in street terms. The program lied about Bruno, and by misdiagnosing the problem as restricted to one bureaucracy rather than a mindset that can infect ANY social group with power, it offers a misdiagnosis relative to cultural conflicts in the modern world.The Universe is infinite.  I think it is fair to say this realization felt like a religious epiphany to Bruno. The parallels should be more than enough to bridge science and religion if people would stop focusing on the reaction of the Church.Dr. Tyson,  sadly never passes up a chance to sucker punch faith in God, or present as intellectual masters those like Bruno if they provide a way to draw distinction between Good thinkers and Bad ones as he oft defines them on the many programs he visits. I embrace both modern science and God, which according to each side is contrary, makes me a bit heretical i guess.
That Seth from family Guy is producing telegraphs the depth of respect we can anticipate for those who accept the minority view that divine intellect is and always has been even as we debate the current observation that reality may be a hologram or checkerboard, still l do enjoy the visuals and updated facts.It sounds more to me like you are going in looking for what you are expecting through confirmation bias, rather than just taking in what is actually there.This may have been a brilliant plan by Ann Druyan, since in the story of Bruno, people see what they want to see. A review of Demon Haunted World by a friend of mine comes to mind, “… underneath it all is a carefully mounted attack on theism. Sagan avoids detonating his explosives himself.” https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/230112510There is nothing antithetical about being a religious believer and a person of science. Many educated religious people believe that science reveals the details and mechanisms of God’s plan, and that the self-organizing properties of matter – from protein folding to evolution itself – are expressions of an inherent intelligence fundamental to the fabric of the universe. But that’s a matter of faith in things inferred but unseen.Like some of what Dr. Tyson expresses on occasion. For instance, his brief mention of the theory of the multi-verse in episode 1. The concept is put forth to explain the inconceivably unlikely values of some physical components of nature such as the speed of light, the strength of gravitational attraction, and the expansion rate of the universe that in specific combination are just right for biogenesis. Michael Turner, astrophysicist at the University of Chicago and Fermilab stated that, “The precision is as if one could throw a dart across the entire universe and hit a bullseye one millimeter in diameter on the other side.”The multi-verse is presented as a mathematical solution to this question. Our universe must be one of many, with an infinite number of universes together containing an infinite variety of physical properties, ours being just one small random sample of those. Sensible enough from the statistical point of view. However, as physicists point out, each theoretical universe is by definition forever cut off from all others, putting the subject beyond scientific scrutiny. That certainly describes science today; there is absolutely no hard evidence that the multi-verse exists, just mathematical inference. Which puts the concept beyond the realm of the scientific method and inquiry and into, dare I say, the realm of faith.Does that mean that people of science should therefore cast ye out the multi-verse heretics? No, the as of now un-provable theory could eventually lead to insights of great value that we can’t foresee today. And it also underscores the point that faith and intuition can coexist comfortably and productively with science and empirical rationality.First, I must remind you that faith is irrational by definition (belief without or despite evidence).Religious beliefs are antithetical to the *practice* of science. Yet people are clearly able to resolve the dissonance. This leads to all sorts of baffling hybrid ideas in the minds of individuals, like Ken Ham, who claims to be a person of science, and the Intelligent Design movement, which claims to be science.I’m not going to argue “No True Scotsman” but I will say these religion/science hybrids are worse at science. In other words, religious believer make poorer scientists, on average, because they’re burdened with wrong ideas they take on faith. Intuition can come just as well, if not better, without the burden of theism.These days, many good scientists still hold on to a tiny shard of the god of the gaps, which isn’t doing much harm, but it isn’t doing much good, either.To say that a scientist is “burdened” by religious belief is just flat out untrue. It’s like saying a brain surgeon cannot be as effective at his job if his faith enables him to look at the brain as something more than a mass of tissue. The scientific method can, and is, followed just as effectively by researchers in all diciplines who also happen to hold a religious belief. On the other hand, many researchers are burdened with prejudices that do negatively impact their ability to objectively adhere to the scientific method. How many wrong trees have scientists barked up over the years owing to ego or even political leanings which clouded their thinking? We’re human, not computers, theists and athiests alike. All subject to the same foibles and foolishness, the most dangerous of which is pride, thinking that we are the exception and the other guy is the one with all the problems.I’ll respectfully agree to disagree with your first paragraph.As for the second paragraph, I agree with you. Ego, politics, etc. have the potential to cloud thinking more severely, in the worst case, than does religious belief, in the best case.Not to belabor the point, but then logically we should shut down all the Catholic hospitals and associated medical schools since their religious staff could only be capable of providing substandard care.Of course not! It doesn’t follow that because they have one irrational belief (i.e. religion) the staff provides substandard care.I have reason to believe they might not provide the best reproductive care, though.You’re wrong about cosmic inflation and the nature of unobservable predictions.Cosmic inflation solves both the flatness problem and the horizon problem. It’s a valid scientific theory which makes unique predictions supported by evidence. There is no rule in science that *all* predictions of a theory must be observable! A theory remains standing so long it’s unique and has at least one testable prediction not yet falsified.For example, you can’t observe virtual particles in QED. But we consider them physically real as they are predictions of QED. We can’t observe stars beyond the observable universe, but we expect they exist because space seems to extend far beyond our observable universe. No single quark has ever, or can ever be isolated, but we consider them real fundamental particles, etc.“there is absolutely no hard evidence that the multi-verse exists, just
mathematical inference. Which puts the concept beyond the realm of the
scientific method and inquiry and into, dare I say, the realm of faith.”To a degree, however, there are people now making empirically testable hypotheses about ways we might infer more strongly the existences of such a multi-verse. For example, some have proposed that collisions with other universes may have left “bruises” and other irregularities in the CMB that would potentially be detectable and explainable in this way. Now, that still doesn’t guarantee the idea’s validity or that such observed irregularities as we already see are caused by other universes, but the mere fact that the question is asked is quite a far cry from faith without seeking further evidence. Science and math projected that this might be one possible scenario, then it said “let’s see if there are empirically testable methods for confirming or rejecting the idea.” It is “faith” in the sense that hard evidence is currently scant but that inference strongly indicates it may be a valid explanation. It is not “faith” in the sense that the debate is closed and further evidence is being neither sought nor considered–which IS the case with many in the religious community about their beliefs concerning the divine.“It is “faith” in the sense that hard evidence is currently scant but that inference strongly indicates it may be a valid explanation.”You could say the same thing about the possibility of an after life. People throughout history, across all cultures have recorded experiences indicating that possibility, some of which are extremely interesting and difficult to explain in conventional terms. But absolutely no indisputable scientific evidence exists at this point, an after life being as cut off from normal life as alternate universes would be from our own. The only things we know for sure, from a scientific point of view, are that there is only one life, the one we inhabit now, and only one universe, the one we inhabit now. Mathematical or philosophical postulates concerning either are interesting but are not scientific proof, they remain speculation, for both scientists and religious believers.The difference still being largely in willingness to embrace new information.
For many religious believers, it is a matter of faith *regardless* of confirming evidence OR even evidence to the contrary. It is faith based on the claim of a religious text and nothing else. Any seeking of empirical evidence is to find confirmation only and to try to sway others to one’s belief. But quite often, contrary evidence is shunned, ignored, or discredited solely because it conflicts with a pre-established belief. You can say that all these out-of-body type experiences *may* be evidence of a soul or afterlife, but when science shows how they are the products of neurons and can even be triggered at will, the faithful just ignore that evidence in favor of their pre-established one.
In science, the “faith” in something like the multiverse is more along the lines of being a matter of faith *until* contrary evidence is discovered and then the idea is discarded and adapted in light of that new evidence. It is not faith regardless of evidence, it is faith awaiting further evidence, which is a very different, more colloquial form of “faith.”From what I’ve read, the idea of infinite space goes all the way back to the ancient Greeks.  Nicolas of Cusa had the insight that other stars might be worlds.  What Bruno appears to have added was that they were suns with worlds circling them, where other beings might live.  Was he the first person to think of this?  Probably not. But his writings on it are among the earliest.  And it’s not strictly true that his views weren’t part of his condemnation.  One of the charges was, “claiming the existence of a plurality of worlds and their eternity.”  This wasn’t the main contention, but it was one of them.I think the point of that sequence on Cosmos was simply to show that repression of ideas is harmful.  Reading more into it, such as it being some kind of anti-religious statement, ignores Neal deGrasse Tyson’s public positions on these matters, or that many religious people deplore inquisitions.Exactly! I suspect many religious viewers identify with Bruno’s religiosity. Choosing him as a hero helps bring them on board the ship of the imagination.… except the entire point of the cartoon was clearly to vilify religion. every article i’ve seen about this show has commenters which trumpet this fact with glee. so how is that going to bring the religious on board?vilify religion or vilify the people in charge of religion at the time?  I think religion is vilify by the people that said to be in charge and commit horrible acts against the people they are suppose to be “indoctrinating”. Torture, culture cleansing and killing makes me think that religion is being used by a few to control the many. I’m a good person and I don’t believe in God. I’m good because I think is the only way Society can move forward and progress.the show makes no particular distinction between the Inquisition and the Chruch as a whole. the problem is that the idea the show talked about isn’t what Bruno was killed for. the show implies that is the case, when in reality he was killed for various other heresies. and as for the idea of infinite worlds, Bruno wasn’t even the first to come up with it or talk about it. prominent examples are Étienne Tempier (a bishop of Paris), who argued that an omnipotent God could create many worlds, even an infinity of worlds back in the mid 1200s, and Nicholas of Cusa (a cardinal), who wrote off and on about the possibility of other stars having other worlds with other life, even intelligent life, and this was in the mid 1400s. Cosmos could have done the show on either person, creating a story that would invite in a Christian audience, rather than turning them off from the show.I don’t think this is a competition of who is more important. Maybe next time the other people will be mention. Maybe not. There are more than a few people doing science. The Christian audience just have to be inspire so they start questioning if a 1700 years old book is the only thing they need to read.  The Bible was written by man, not God. If God exists why didn’t he wrote something futuristic to show he was behind the Bible. Everything on the Bible was current to the times. That doesn’t make sense. Earth is a tiny planet in a humongous Universe. The Bible should had mentioned that.Perhaps. it’s my opinion the show should have started with either Copernicus or Galileo, perhaps both, since both were so important in the field of astronomy and a major shift in the way people thought about the universe. Bruno just isn’t important at all in comparison. he’s just such a minor character that it really doesn’t make sense to me to include him – unless the point is to bash on Christianity. Which they do.Turning a Christian audience off of the show is not going to “inspire” them. you are blaming the wrong people. If “Christian” decide to kill people they disagree with, and a person comments about the killing, the person that turns people off from Christianity are the killers, not the people telling the story.the point is the story of Bruno is out of place on Cosmos. it’s a complicated story that demands a far more rigorous explanation of what was going on both historically and specifically in his case. the show makes it seem like he’s killed for his view of the cosmos, in effect lying to all their viewers. this is not “a person” it’s a show, supposedly supposed to be educational, presenting a very one-sided story, broadcasting misinformation by doing a botched job of portraying history.I don’t need any TV show to tell me what was going on with the Church. I’m from Peru. I went below the church. I saw the torture devices used to “convince” people that they were wrong. The Church for a long time didn’t care about people. Only care about their power. Except for St Francois de Asis    a true Christian.*sigh* it’s clear you have no desire to listen to reason. sorry about that. if you don’t care about a deceptive portrayal of history being broadcast to the masses as the truth, then you probably shouldn’t be responding to my comments.*sigh* I didn’t know you were brainwashed (now you start with the insults I think I can continue). Just because you don’t like what the Church has done on the past, that doesn’t make it deceptive (you might confuse some people but not me). I saw a First Nation old guy on TV showing the scar on his hand. A Priest stab him with a pencil because he spoke on his mother tongue. That happened in Canada in the 40′ – 50′. Was that Jesus spreading love?when did i insult you? you are talking about things that are not related to what i’ve been saying. you are ignoring what i am saying. my point is not about whether or not anyone likes what the church has done. my point is that the SHOW was deceptive by not portraying what happened in an accurate way.I disagree. I saw it as vilifying the Roman Inquisition, something that many modern churchgoers can easily get on board with.well, perhaps. but is that really something that Cosmos should have devoted a quarter of its air time to? I really think a better “hero of science” could have been chosen, maybe someone who actually contributed something to science.if they wanted to make the point that the repression of idea is harmful, they should have just said that, rather than making a cartoon that shows the inquisition killing someone for having an idea about the cosmos, which isn’t even close to historically accurate.Saying “isn’t even close to historically accurate” isn’t itself an accurate assessment of that sequence.  Bruno was condemned by the church, and one of the charges related to his cosmology.  It’s history, albeit dramatized.And showing repression of ideas is always better than just talking about it.the problem is that the idea the show talked about isn’t what he was killed for. the show implies that is the case, when in reality he was killed for various other heresies. and as for the idea of infinite worlds, he wasn’t even the first to come up with it or talk about it. prominent examples are Étienne Tempier (a bishop of Paris), who argued that an omnipotent God could create many worlds, even an infinity of worlds back in the mid 1200s, and Nicholas of Cusa (a cardinal), who wrote off and on about the possibility of other stars having other worlds with other life, even intelligent life, and this was in the mid 1400s. Cosmos could have done the show on either person, creating a story that would invite in a Christian audience, rather than turning them off from the show.Something tells me that those who are offended by the inquisition being shown probably will find many other things to take offense about on the show.so you agree that it is historically inaccurate?Just re-watched the Bruno sequence.  From what I’ve read about him, it was mostly accurate, albeit with some license for dramatization.  They showed the cardinals reading the charges, including the religious ones.  Tyson was clear that he wasn’t a scientist or that his ideas weren’t scientific.As I mentioned in my initial comment, Bruno’s ideas may not have been that unique, but he promoted them heavily, and suffered for it.  He was condemned for his theology (basically pantheism) and for his cosmology (see the list of charges).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#Imprisonment.2C_trial_and_execution.2C_1593.E2.80.931600so why didn’t the show explain the theological heresies? because then their “hero” would be “mr. crazy guy”They did in fact show them.You complained above about your perception (which I think is mistaken) of the show not being friendly toward Christians.  How do you think pantheists would take your referring to Bruno as “mr. crazy guy”?except they didn’t. they could have gone into detail about how his New Agey, pantheistic bent violated doctrine regarding the incarnation and deity of Christ, transubstantiation, and the trinity, among other things, which are the heresies he was executed for. the entire Bruno segment was an excuse to bash on Christianity. it’s pretty obvious, and that makes it obviously out of place. why are they alienating an audience they should be trying to attract?Do you endorse the inquisition?  Why are you offended by them showing it? It’s worth noting that a lot of Christians were persecuted by it.The Bruno sequence showed a part of the history of cosmological thought, and served as a caution against suppressing ideas, both religious and scientific.  If you don’t think it belonged on Cosmos, then it might pay you to re-watch Tyson’s opening remarks.  (Or Sagan’s in the original.)Nice straw man argument. the point isn’t whether or not what the inquisition did was right. try to keep on track. the issue here is portraying events with intellectual and historical honesty. Cosmos made it seem like Bruno was killed for his view of the universe, which is simply not the case. if they were intent on showing the history of cosmological thought, Copernicus would have been a better choice of “hero,” since Bruno’s ideas were neither original nor did they build upon what came before.We’ve already covered those points already.  I have no desire to argue in circles.  We disagree.  I hope you can find a way to enjoy the series and wish you all the best.A faint hope, indeed, should their farcical portrayals of history continue. Can you answer the question I asked before? Why are they bent on alienating an audience they should be trying to attract?I’m not convinced they are bent on alienating anyone.  However, I do think they’re not going to compromise the message to avoid offense.  If they follow the old series’s track, the next episode will be on evolution, and many will undoubtably be offended by it, and ask why they couldn’t have skipped that part to avoid offending them.So you think that the portrayal of the Church as Disney-esque villains was a gesture of good will and inclusiveness?Their “message” is already compromised by this choice of “hero”… that is the problem!! I’ll grant that they oversimplified the emotions of the trial for drama.  Still, it’s a ten minute cartoon, so nuance is hard to incorporate.  And remember that the 16th century church actually did sentence a lot of people to burn at the stake for their ideas.  By modern standards, pretty villainous behavior.Then why include it at all?We’re back to already covered ground where I fear we’re just going to have to agree to disagree.indeed. since you cannot answer this question, it seems our conversation is at an end.Taunting?  Yep, we’re done.  Best of luck to you.Hmmm, my last response disappeared.  Sorry if this ends up being a double response.I re-watched the Bruno sequence.  Based on what I’ve read about him, it was mostly accurate, albeit taking some license for dramatization.  They made it clear that he was condemned for both religious and cosmological views, and Tyson clearly stated he wasn’t a scientist.I do not agree with the basic premise of this post/comment. It is clear to me that Ann Druyan chose to tell the Giordano Bruno for reasons that she knows that Carl would have agreed.In fact, these reasons are the main subject and the reason for the last book that Carl Sagan wrote (with Ann as co-writer), “The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark”.At the same time, is one of the most brilliant works by Sagan ,and at the same time, one of the least well known.This book expresses Carl Sagan’s deep concerns for what he clearly identified as a troubling trend in the world: the polarizaion of politics around the world away from reason and objective thinking and towards twisted forms of ideologies.The book was published in 1997, just about 4 years ahead of 9/11, and the reference to that event is not gratituous nor out of line.So, the argument that the producers and writers of Cosmos wasted the opportunity to reconcile science with politics and religion is not proper from the get-go: if you defend reason and objective thinking, you do not put up a fight with ideologies, for sure, but also you do not choose to reconcile with unreasonable people either.Kind regards, GENFrom my article: “A second, deeper irony is that in trying to show how science and religion sometimes worked hand in hand, Cosmos missed a chance to showcase a key episode in brokering peace between the two sides.” Nowhere do I suggest that Cosmos should have tried to “reconcile science and religion.” What I’m saying is that the show missed an opportunity to be more truthful and insightful about how the conflict actually played out–ie, to present the world as it really was, not as we like to imagine it.I think you expect too much of a cartoon segment in a 45-minute TV show.That’s what I find so interesting. I have scrupulously not stated any opinion on the matter; this article is about trying to understand the reality of a fascinating and oft-simplified historical era. All the comments here about what I do or do not believe are entirely projections of the commenters, reflecting their biases and assumptions.That’s fair. I’m still curious what you believe.I don’t think expecting a show extolling the goodness of truth and fact over agenda and wishful thinking to, well, get the facts straight and not bend them to an agenda is too much to ask.“It’s just a cartoon” is not an excuse considering the express intent of the show it’s part of.Extolling the goodness of truth and fact is a hard job. Just a cartoon isn’t offered as an excuse, but a genuine explanation for certain visual features. For example, Bruno is shown alone, not with his teachers, compatriots, or collaborators. This was a choice that I defend as reasonable in the context of making an animation about one man. Corey thinks they should have spent more time on his peers. That’s a reasonable thing to ask which only Ann Druyan can answer.I don’t know what agenda you’re talking about. If you saw it as an attack on religion, you’re the one with an agenda.You can chalk it up to need to simplify “animation” if the spoken narration didn’t reinforce the idea, which it did.   It’s not about the economy of animation.  It’s what they intended.I see it as an attack on religion, because there isn’t anything else it could be.  It, too, is reinforced by the sensationalist montage of torture devices which didn’t even exist at the time, and certainly were not used on Bruno, yet the segment certainly implies they were, because hey, that’s how they want you to think the church rolled.And I’m not even religious.  I can just see it for what it is, and it’s deeply disappointing for something that’s supposed to be about promoting science.Well put. I’m glad you brought up the Demon-Haunted World. I worry some people might have forgotten this side of Sagan.Carl sent me a review draft for textual comments, so I too remember it, and I don’t recognize your above-expressed opinions in it. Maybe we’d both benefit from going back and reading it again.To which above-expressed opinions do you refer?GEN was talking about the reason Ann Druyan chose to tell the Bruno story. I think there are multiple reasons, chapter by chapter:7. From the Book’s title chapter, “Witchcraft of course was not the only offense that merited torture and burning at the stake. Heresy was a still more serious crime, and both Catholics and Protestants punished it ruthlessly.”8. The distinction between true and false visions, literally the title of the chapter!25. The value of the freedom to ask questions and challenge dogma.BOOOOMBruno also believed in polygenesis:  that blacks were not of the same species as Europeans.That tends to get omitted a lot.Yuck, that’s the best argument for omitting him I’ve yet heard.Since he wrote in the period when Africans and Asians were enslaving millions of Europeans, maybe that was a way to dodge human collective guilt.Probably true, and certainly sad.So we wont dismiss him for ebign an egostitical jerk or for beign a mystic, but for the entirleh modenr idea hat racism os the orst thign ever.Kinda displayign yruown Chronological Snobbery here.Are you typing on a potato? I can’t understand what you’re saying. Seriously.I am Dyslexic.OK, I agree that it is a terrible idea, but it was the 1500s. Voltaire and Hume and a host of other Enlightenment-era thinkers also believed in it and they did so much later.Now take some of that understanding, and apply it to the anti-heliocentric people.Something for all here to think about: One of Carl Sagan’s most famous sound bites from Cosmos.“The cosmos is also within us, We’re made of star stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” It’s not a religious statement. It’s not a scientific statement. It’s a spiritual statement, and quite a lovely one. To me it epitomizes the tone that made the original Cosmos such an inspirational classic.Actually, it is a scientific statement about the origin of the atoms in our bodies.“We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” I would like to hear how that “scientific statement” can be tested and falsified.And this is why you don’t have christards be mods on a science site.Let’s see, the elements that make us up were forged in the supernovas of stars, and we understand the cosmos.Oh man, so hard /sThe star stuff part is a scientific statement. The more poetic bit about being a way for the cosmos to know itself is pure dramatic flair, romanticism, and possible spirituality. Sure all works nicely together, though.“for one man” is not the same as “for *just* one man”, and it is an (unfortunate but maybe necessary) aspect of popular presentations to concentrate on an example rather than discussing the overall pattern. I agree that the bigger story was worth telling – especially the role of Thomas Digges – and I thank you for doing that. (It was a lost opportunity for Cosmos but they do have to make choices and will have to leave lots of other great stuff out – which I guess should be a great opportunity for you and others like you who want to build on the foundation of public interest that Cosmos may generate.)My only quibble (and I can’t point to the exact words which make me feel this way) is that this piece feels to me to be a bit uncharitable towards the new Cosmos and a bit of a “hatchet job” on Bruno.The words “hatchet job” came to my mind as well. Corey obviously knows a lot about and likes Digge. That’s cool. I second your appreciation for bringing him up! I don’t like headline conclusion that Cosmos did something “wrong”.The Neo-Platonists, the authors of the Vedas, and the Hebrew Qabbalists all posited an infinite God who was identical with Infinity at the same time before Bruno and Cusa, of course Bruno as a Qabbalist, Hermeticist, Alchemist, Astrologer was aware of these things and the basic microcosm/macrocosm view of reality held by the aforementioned groups. Either way it’s ironic they paint Bruno as a sort of proto-atheist/fore runner of the seemingly soul less science of modern times.First of all, it feels petty to me arguing about who done it first.Remember, this is a TV cartoon, they had to make decisions about how to literally paint the hero. I wish it had been more accurate, too. I felt the same when they showed a dense asteroid field, which looked right out of Star Wars. An accurate asteroid field would be tiny specs of light, and not visually compelling enough for TV. Same with a realistic Bruno. It’s sad, but true.Agreed, It is petty to argue ‘who done what’ first. But both the program and the author of the above article seem to be making pettiness a point, hence I hope my post would point to that pettiness. 😉Very cool!Just show me the evidence for the subject you wish to propose, and then we can have a conversation. Simple as that. Otherwise, everything else is opinion.On another note that involves neither Christianity nor modern astronomy, Buddhists were writing texts claiming that space was infinite and that other worlds were inhabited long before any of these people.Very true, and an important point. Ideas about the infinite, and about infinite space in particular, have a long history before Bruno, Digges, and Nicolas of Cuna. What is significant about this later era referenced in Cosmos is that it was the time when people began merging the idea of the infinite with the idea of a mathematical, predictable universe. Modern cosmology derives directly from that innovation.Seems to me it was a bit more of a subtle strike in the war against religious ignorance.  We, in the US, are seeing lines being drawn that separate (even further) scientific thinking from fundamental theology.  A person can’t come away from that thinking religion is the way to go.Really? The hero was devout, if a heretic. I think bright, young churchgoers of today (lots of them here in the US!) will identify with a person of faith who thinks the old testament god is too small.Bruno didnt think the Old testament God wss too msmall, and relaly neither do modern Atheists. The Citism of the Old tetament is baed largley o Ignorance.Also, Big Bang Theory isnt seen as Heretical to moern potestnats, who typiclalydotn use the term Hereical. Its also not onsideed Anti-God givne it was concocted by a jesuit Priest.Got a source to back up your claim about “modern atheists” not thinking god is too small and being ignorant of the old testament? Speaking only for myself, neither are true.I don’t know what point you’re trying to argue by stating protestants accept the Big Bang theory. I’ve had to say, over and over, that I understand religions slowly adapt. Just look at out new pope! This has nothing to do with the harm theism (the belief system) does to science (the process of finding things out).Its God. The G is capitalised. The fad in leaving god in lower case G makes no sense. I know you don’t believe in God but, Theists don’t capitalise the G out of veneration for God, it’s capitalised because its used as a name. Please don’t tell em the crap excuses I usually hear that god is not gods name, that doesn’t alter the grammar rules that explicitly state that if you use a word in place of a name that word is nonetheless treated as a name. No, god is not a Title either, as God is not a man who holds the position of god, and even if god were a Title, given we capitalise “Mr. President” if we use it to identify a specific individual the point still stands. Spelling god in lower case doesn’t indicate your lack of belief in a god ( which isn’t the actual definition to Atheism anyway) but your poor Grammatical skills.With that said the burden of proof is on you. You’re claiming that Theism harms Science. Well, prove it. How does Theism in itself harm Science? Please don’t spout of on individual beliefs held by some but not all Theists, I want to know how Theism in and of itself actually hampers Science or is harmful in any way.Just saying Theism is harmful to Science, or society, is not good enough. I want actual Reasons to believe Theism is Harmful.Theism is the belief in a supernatural god who created and intervenes with the world. This supernatural belief takes the place natural explanation. The most obvious example would be taking the bible literally and disbelieving the great age of the universe. Most scientifically minded folks avoid this mistake, Ken Ham not included.However, lighter, more insidious versions exist, in physics, for example. There are those who deny the hierarchy problem by saying that God fine-tuned the constants of nature. This is a mistake made because of theism.I don’t care what Google defines terms as, Google is wrong. Havign sayd that, Theism is the beleif that a god exists. That is the exent of what Theism ks. Theism is not beleif in a Supernatural personal god. Theism incldes beleif in a Suprnatural persnal god, but is not limited to this. If you blive in a personal god that is Natural, you are a Theist. If youbeleive in an Impersonal god, you are a Thist.Theism is not the beleif in an active personal supernatural god and simply repeatin that it is won’t change the Reality.Your also wogn abot beleif in a Supernatural personal god. Such b3lif dos not automaticlaly lead to replacign Natural explanations, as plenty of peopel blive in an actie Superantural god whodotn evben beleive in the Binle, and even thoe who do beleive int he Bile often accept Evolution.Yoru claims are thus ninsense. Simply beleivign that a personal,supernatural god exist does not automaticlaly make you Anto-Science. Creationsim  doesnt even make you Amnti-Scence as Evolution is not the end all be all of Science.Call the dictionary wrong all you want. Have fun.Yes, simply believing in a personal, supernatural god exists is an exercise in anti-science. Yes, it is.Yes, creationism is totally anti-science. Totally!The thign is, Dictioanries have been wrong. Take a look below.http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/may/10/dictionary-definition-siphon-wrongAre you gping to argue that a Siphon works by Atmospehric pressue instead of graviy becsuse that’s hwo OED defined it for over a century?besies, there are more definitions to the word Relgiion than just one, and more than one Dictionary. Why shoudl i think all definitiosn are wogn except the “Belei in, and reverence of, gods and supernatural powers’ oen you foudn on Google? Why is it the dfinitive final word on the topic?Also, you haven’t explaiend why beleivign in a personal, supernatral god is an excersise in Anti-Science. Just declarign it to be so is not convincing. Even if we bough into the idea that beign a creationist makes you Anti-Science, we’d still run into theproblem that beleif in a personal, Supernaual god is not the sme thign as Creatonism. ou can actually accept Evolution and beleive in a personal suprnatural god. There is no Logical reason to think otherwise.Furthermroe, Atheism was the official Doctrine of the Soviet Union and theypromoted Lysenkoism for decades, denyign genetics. Atheism doens’t automaticlaly correlate with scintific Accuracy.I also don’t buy the ides that Creationism is Anti-Science. Science is not Evolution. While Evolutionary Theory is a promenant Theory in Sciene, its still just a Theory. Please don’t gve me a knee jerk reaction that Theory means somethign differentthan I think it does, I now a Theory is a tested model that explaisn data and has withstood examination, but at the same Time I also know that no one Theory is the sum of all Science, and that rejection of any oen Theory, no matter how Highly Reagrded or well established it is, is not the same thign as rejection of Sciene as a wole. Ken Ham, your own example, doesnot rejt Science as a whole. He acceots, for example, Einstens Relativity Theory, as ell as basi Science like the Laws of Gravity and Electromagnetism. he even accepts Bilogial Sciences such as how Cells are prodced and diide in the Body or how food is metabolised. Simply rejecting that over Time chages happened that produced new Spiciese doesn’t mean he has rejected literally all of Science.So you’re rong, beleif in a personal, spernatural god is nto an excersise in Anti-Science and begn a creationist is not the natural state of someone who beleives in a personal supernatural god, and beign a creationist is not the same thign as beign Anti-Science.I never said atheism automatically correlates with scientific accuracy. Ken Ham is wrong about evolution, and wouldn’t be if not for that darn bible that says something that happens to be false about the origin of species. The book, his religion, gets in the way. When you say “literally all of science” you’re conflating the products of science (theories upheld by evidence) and the scientific method (also known as just “science”). Ken Ham’s religion gets in the way of his thinking process. He short-cuts from the evidence to a wrong belief because in the middle, there’s this other, intervening, wrong belief in creationism as the origin of species.I think this conversation is over, because you keep repeating the same bogus argument over and over, redefining terms when convenient, and conflating the rest in straw-man arguments.Thanks for being a great example of how poor are the arguments in defense of building a bridge between religion and science.Ken Ham isn’t wrong becase the Bible said somehgin wrong, and he beleives it instad of Truth. In fact, Historiclaly the Creation Account wasn’t read quiet as Litealistically as you’d liek to imagine, as Augutine, Origen, and other noted and influencial Theologianzs have in fact read it very differently. The fautkl is not, and has never been, with the Bible.Not that it matters, as you claimed bekleivign in a personal Supernatural gos ws Anti-Science in itself, and it’s not. Even if we accepted the Biel is Anti-Science, that does’t mean beleif in a Personal, Supernatural god is.Given that you’ve compleltey ignored this, and the fac tthat Dictionaries can be wrong, and the fact that tghe Dictioanry Definition of Relgiion you pull off Google represent sonly oen definition, sayign that I’m a good exampel of why you can’t brindge Sicence and Relgiion only serves to prove how your own beelifs blidn you.You see, as mich as you think Relgiion prevents Ken Ham from comign tot he Truth as it interferes with his THoguth Proccess, the same thign si True of you. Yoru Relgiion keeps you from the Truth. You have this absolute beleif that Relgiiion is in and of itself a hidnerance to Science, and as such refuse to even consider the possibility that your’ wrong. You even refuse to accep that Relgiion can’t be reduced to mere beleif in gods and the supernatural, becaue you need thee to be a distioncion between Relgiion and Atheism.But in the end, you realy haven’t proven that beleivign a supernatural god exists qill automaticlaly prevent you from beleivign in Science. The best you can do is show us that Ken Ham is a Creationist and say that Relgiion blocks Sicence by this, which itself ignes the fact that most Chistains don’t have a problem with Evolution.If you can accept Evolutionary Theory and be a Christain, then what does Ken Ham Prove? His Theology may inform him of his Creationism, and be the reason eh rejects Evolution, butnot all Christains reject Evolution, not all of them end up as Ken Ham. So, the Bible doens’t block peopel from becoming Evoluntionists, and belfi in God doens’t blockthem from becomign Evolutionists.You’ve “Proven” that Relgiion and Sciene are incompatible by sayign Ken Ham woudl nolt be a Creationist if not for his Relgiion, which doesnt explain how, fi this is True, that you can still find any number of Christains who accept Evolution.You can call this straw man and repetition but, its neither. You never addressed this. You need to find exampel sthat “Prove” your already arived at conclusiont hat Reliion and Sicnece are hostile and incompatible and then use Ham as an exampel as if he’s the final, abslute proof. He isnt. He’s one guy. Yes he has followrs but, so what? The Majority fo Christains accept Evolutionso he’s not the evidnece that Relgiion ina nd of itself blocks Sicence you hope he is.When all is said and done, you’re just looking for evidnece to support your assertion, and will dismiss any evidence that contradicts your claims. That can then be used, if we eployed ghe same method as you just did, that Atheism blocks Reason, sicne yoru basiclaly trying to prove a modrn Dogma of Militant Atheism, that Science and Relgiion are Hostole, and efue to accept any possible evidnece that disproves it whilst graspign at any narrow pijnt you think can serve to prove it.Beign selective with what evidnece you use and only lookign for that which supports your beleifs is not the way to arrive at the Truth.No, sorry, Ken Ham got the idea that animals were all brought into existence by one being from the Bible. That’s where he got the idea. Where else would he have gotten it? He does take it literally. The idea is wrong.My argument doesn’t follow from the example of Ken Ham alone. It follows from all the people who reject natural explanation of some things (or the potential for a natural explanation of those things) because of their religious belief. You know what I call people who has no such religious beliefs that supersede natural explanations?Atheists.You know, Atheists have come up with some pretty wild, pretty wrong explanations abou he nature of our world. The Soviets once eclared that Quantum Physics was wrong, based on their firm belei in Dialectic Materialism, ad even denied Atomic Science. Oh, and don’t forget the Lysenkoism they adhered to.You’ve been accused by another poster of reading into things what you want to see, and I have to agree. Even in my post above, you din’t really read the arguments I made but rather tried to fit them ito a preestablished framework you use. My argument that not everyone who reads the Bible becomes a Yougn Earth creationist doens’t go away becaue you said this happened to Ken Ham. You’d still have to explain why Augusine didn’t become a Yougn Earth creationist way back in 325 AD,but you can’t, because you’re too busy tellign us that beelif in a suprnatural, personal god is Anti-Science becaue of Ken Ham.Ken Ham does not represent all Christians, or all peopel who beleiveint he Bible, or ven all popel whotake the Bible Liteally, and beelif in the Bible, or just a Supernatural, personal god, does not auomaticlaly rpevent you from accepign Naturlaistic explanatiosn for specific phoenomenon. Just liek Atheism doesn’t autmaticlaly mean you acceot the current findigns of Science. In fact, Atheism doesnt even mean you have to accept Naturalism, since he Raelians are Atheists and ebelif in a quasi-supernatural existnce.The real problem with ou is that you want everyone to fit into neat little pacjages and they just don’t. Atheism does not mean you accept Natural explanations, and Theism does not mean you reject them. The fact that there are Christians who accept Evolution, alogn with the act that durign the Middle Ages the most popular way to udnestand the Bible was via Allegorial Exegesis, and that was long bfore Darwin, proves you wrong. In fact, Meaeval Monks sometiems even postulated abotu Natural Answers for whee life came from, under the School Of Thoguth that God worked via Nature. Even in the Supposed Drk Ages you had not just Theists, but explicit Christans who didn’t reject Naturalistic explanations. In fact, even the original Fundamentalists, the Real ones, ntot he oens used in Arugments as if they hat everyone, actually acceped Evolutiionary Theory and if you read Dixons work youd’ see a FUndamentalist acually acceptign Evolution. He took the Bibel Literally and yet he accepted Evolution.You’re simply wrong that Relgiion itself hampers Science or that ebelfi in a god autmaticlaly blocks you form thinkign Rationally or acceptign cience, just as you’re wrong that Atheism autimaticlaly lets you accpt Naturalistic explanations. There is no Reaon to think that alone they do. Even yoru KEn Ham example fails because it’s nto the Bible and the Bible alon that keeps Ham from acceptign Evolution, it’s his Understandign of the Bible. The Bible itself dosnt block him.Plus, a I noted, rejection of one Theory is not rejection of Science a a whole.You’re just wong, Atheism doesnt let you accept anythgin otehr than no gods exist, and does not make you accept Naturlaosyic Explanations, and Theism doesnt block Naturlaistic explanations.Thanks for helping me understand what people mean when they say it’s a waste of time arguing with theists.Whenever I hear an “Atheist’ say this, I know it means that they don’t want to admit they were wrong, but they have no real argument agisnt what I’ve said. It[‘s not really True that aruong with Thitss is a waste of Time, so much as its True that you dn’t want ogive up your claims abotu how Religion and Scienc re incompatible or even consider that the Reality can be more complex than you’re simplistic assessment assumes. Instead, you prefer to tell the Theist that they are a wate of Time, or delusional, or Irational, and act like the problem is with them.it’s really a cheap, childish intiomidation method, that doens’t work since you still haven’t addressed what I’ve said.The Truth remains that you are wrong, in your definition of what Reliion is, in what you think Atheism is, and in the idea that Religious Beleifs automaticlaly hinder Science.Thanks again.I didn’t bully anyoen and didn’t change the definitns of words. In fact, all I did was point out that there are mroe definitions than you allwoed for, given you insist Faith, at leays Relgioosu Faith, ha sonly one dfiniton and so does Religion, which happens to eb the Defimnition most helpful to your arugments. I also noted that Dictioanries can be, and are, wrong sometimes. How si that Bullying? Simply, because you don’t like the fact that not everyone is goign to bow down tot he singualr definitions you use.I also didn’t call otu Atheists in general, but am Tired of the Militant sort of Atheist who isnsitt aht Relgiion is Hosgile to Sicnece and Rational epopel arent Reliious promotign this ultimatley hatefilled, bigoted viewpoint.The Truth is, you made claism that arent supproted by yoru arugments. Relgiion does not prevent one rom beign Sicntific, and Relgiion is not Anti-Scinece. Theism is not beelif in a personal, sueprnatural god, nor is belefi ina personal, supernatural god in itself Anti-Science. Why shodul anone accept this?The Respectful Tone you presented wa soutright hostile and also demandng. You want evryone to think of all Relgiosu epopel as Anti-Science simpeltons, and you call that Respectful?I accept your apology.I didn’t apologise for anything, and stand by everythign I’ve said. I also didn’t bully you or act rudly to you. I did refute what you had said, but that’s not beign Rude.Sayng “I accept yoru Apology” comes off as really crass since, let’s face it. you’re just trying to undermine hat i said so you don;t have to present an actual address to it. Beforehand the only address was to say I was wrong with little to no real reason for me beign wrong. Now its simply lying about my intentions and statements.You make some good points.No one likes being COndescended towards, and I’m not as stupid as you seem to think I am.Yes, you’re very smart person.It’s Arrogance like this that wins you few Favours, and reveals you do not have a Rational Mind.Truer words were never spoken.You do realise you were the Object In Reference I Trust.Would you lump anti-GMO athiests in with the rest of the irrational?I would call a person’s anti-GMO beliefs irrational, whether or not they happen to be an atheist.Would you lump the anti-GMO athiests in with the rest of the irrational?Who said religious people have a monopoly on irrational beliefs? They do hold a sizable share of the market, though, at least here in the US.Based on what reputable studies and solid evidence exactly? And how does that compare to the irrational beliefs of non-religious people? Blanket statements based on your “gut feelings” aren’t scientific, let alone entirely rational.There have been many non-theistic belief systems that, although they preened themselves to be based on science, turned out to be nonsensical. Communism, National Socialism, Eugenics to name a few. In our time, the anti-GMO movement and Climate Catastrophism, both of which take a cherry-picked select set of data mixed with a good old fashioned dose of apocalyptic paranoia to produce something as goofy as any religious cult ever did. And, before you melt your keyboard, by Climate Catastrophism I mean the difference between the atmospheric measurements of actual global warming (and it is real, see below) versus the apocalyptic warnings and exaggerations made by those I consider to be non-scientific AGW cultists:
http://fwrhn487tjy48uvw13uigsy9ht.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chart.jpg,Hare-brained goofiness isn’t the preserve of centuries past or the religious. It’s also widespread today among people who are utterly blind to it in themselves.My comment about the “sizable share of the market” was more of a joke, but I’m interested in your idea of quantifying religious irrationality and comparing it to other forms.Have you seen any study which attempts this? Maybe it could be conducted in a manner similar to this study. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098391Physics Police, every human being alive has irrational beliefs, including you.  Nobody, that is, nobody, is entirely rational.DJ1706, I haven’t argued otherwise!In this case the “individual” was devout, but the church “as an institution” that he embraced shunned and eventually killed him over his views.  willful ignorance, in any form, is a bad thing.  That this article’s topic was the choice of a religious figure as the hero, is the reason for the theism bent of my post .. yes, the same goes for anti-GMO atheists, polytheists and monotheists.I agree! Depending on your point of view:1. As an atheist, I see religion as stifling progress.
2. As a theist, I relate to Bruno as a hero and scientist.It’s got something for everybody! Presumably, this was intended by the writers.Atheists should not see Relgiion as stiflign Sicnece, as thatsjust a Myth not required to be an Atheit. And Bruno wasnt a Hero.I don’t blame religion in antiquity any more than bed-wetting in infancy. But now, in the 21st century, religion (defined as theism, the sincere belief in the supernatural, not to be confused with deism) undeniably stifles scientific progress.I don’t care if Bruno is or isn’t a true hero, but I agree with Corey that he’s portrayed using the hero myth in this episode of Cosmos.Ive tld you this before, you can’t get
rid of Thism and keep Deism. Deism isnot distinct from Theism, Deism
is a kind of Theism. If you think one can be rational and a Dieist,
then you cannot say Theism is Irrational since Deism is Theism,
though Theism is not Deism.Theism is just belief in a god, not
beelif in an active interventionist god.That said, comparign Religion, which
you misdefine as a synonym for Theism and beelfi in the supernatural,
with bedwettign and Childishness and actign as if Atheism is the only
sensabel choice, other than Deism ( which again is just a kind of
Theism itself) isn’t really Rational. Ou have no real reason to say
that Religion stifles Sxienticfic thought. Why wudl it? Why would
ebelfi in a god and the Supernatural somehow halt wscience? Just
ebcsuse?One thign I really get tired of is how
arrogant Gnu Atheists are, and the hwoel dies that rhey are the upper
teir of Humanity hwi have m,atured pastthe promitive Religiosu Peoepl
and have made it to a higher level fo Consciosuness towhich they
aspire ot help otherws to is just a vain, wholly narseccsistig
approach that’s geared more towards stokign egos than actually
providing any Answers. Calling yourself more avancd ot Reliiosu
beelif promitive and useless is just stupid, and frsnkly, the idea
that Relgiion, as you specificlaly definedit, srifles Sicne is
stupid. Just sayign this is Undeniable doesnt work either sicne way
too many peoepl are denign it and ou haven’t povided any Reason cor
anyoem to actually think that.I canjust as reaily say Atheism is a
Childish myth that belogns to simpel minded people who havent matured
enugh to realsie God exists, and Atheism Undeniably  Stifles Science,
and its the same thing. I don’t need evidence, I can just assert it.Deism is very distinct from theism. I’m an agnostic-deist, in the sense that I don’t reject the possibility that our universe is an intentional computer simulation or pocket of spacetime inflated with intention by some alien intelligence.In that science-fiction sense, our universe could indeed have been created, and I’ll grant the label agnostic-deist when it’s helpful.Human-created religion are far too parochial and anthropocentric to be even close to the truth. No theism for me, no thank you.Theism coms fromt eh root word Theos. Theos means god in a generic sence.THeism means that you beleive a god exists.Deism is thebeleif that a god created the Universe then left it alone.I knwo you want to think of Theism as the beelfi in a personal god that intervenes in his Creation, as opposed to Deism which has a god that does not get invovled in his Creation, but that’s not True. Theism is any beleif in any god. Deism is a kind of Theism. Just like Pantheism is a kind of Theism, or Penantheism is a kind of Theism.The distinction between Deism and Theism is not a Valid one. Yiu simply donot understand the term Theism.Okay, I can go with that definition.If by “a god” you mean a metaphor for nature, then we’re not really talking about god at all.its God, cap G. Why is it a fad in soem Arhisst ircles to leave god in lowr cae? its incorret Grammar. Its used as a name.Also, not everyone who views God as natural views God as a Metaphore for naure. This is why you arent actually engagign in a discussion about pepels beelifs. Yoru eeductionism insists on definign temrs your way and refusign to accept other views as even possible.Really, you’re going to complain to me about correct grammar? Really?My grammar is flawless, its my soellign thats off, and that’s becsuse I am dyslexic.Also, all words mean something, but that doens’t alter the point. The word god may not be a proper noun in itself, but if you use the word god to identify a specific entity, then the ord god becomes, as far as the sentence is concerned, that entities name. The idea that god is not a name and therefore does not require capitalisaton is thus an error. If I call you God, then I’d still have to capitalise it since, in the terms of the senence, God is yoru name. It doens;’t matter if God is your actual name, or why I’m callign iy God, it’s simply True that God is beign used in place of your name, and thus is the name I am callign you.So when you saythigns liek god does nto exist or that Christains beleive in god, you arne’t usign a generic term that’s nto a name, you’r identifyign a speciifc entuty, and callign that entity god. Sayign this isn’t a name is simply stupid. I get that modern Atheists have taken to spellign god in lowr case, as a way to swo they don’t beeliv ein god. I getit, Christaisn leave the eord god in lowr case for all gods btu their own, but it’s still fundamentlal flawed since Cheistians didn’t start leaving god in lower csse in reference to other gods simply to create a distinction betweent he True God ( fom their persepctive0 and the fake ones, and hye ddn’t capitalise the G out ofreverence for their god, it’s done becaue it is, in fac, used in place of a name and is, in fact, used as the name of said beong. To ignroe this, and to claim that gdo is nto a name and thatit’s correct to leave it in lower case, it just silly and irrational.there are much better choices. if you wanted to appeal to religious and atheists who both reject the literalist interpretation of genesis why not go with someone  else from the same period of time like Nicholas Steno? First of all he’s canonized by the church, so he’s been vetted and second he’s lauded by the scientific community for laying the groundwork of fossil research (no pun intended) by which literalists would be disproved. it’s win win!This is special pleading. There are many ways that Bruno is a good choice, other than just appeal to religious and atheists alike. For example, Nicholas Steno didn’t study astronomy.I think the problemis mroe percpetion than Reality. If we’d abandon the COnflict Thesi that says you have to choose between Science and Relgiion, and instead trated vrtthgin as beleif instead of categorisign it separatley, we coudl explain tot he Public why certain things are beelived in. as it stands, we see polirisation namly because of an inssitent conflcut. its rather like Politics. When studying Psychology, I have seen studies that show how peppels political views change. I saw a reporton how a man became a hard core Liberal, but when he was a teenager and in hsi 20’s he as only vauely Liberal. it began when he became active in a campaign. He was actually Pro-Life and opposed abortion then, and didn’t really agree with the Democrsts on a lot of issues such as immigration reform or Tax policies, but did upporthem as they wantd toprotect the Environemnt. Well,the mroe Time he spent withthem, he mroe of their ideologies he beelivedin, until he became Pro-Choice and suppoted all their stances on the party platform.He also hated the Republicans, but didnt get right what they actually beelivedin on their platform. All his info cam from the Democrsts.The sme thign happens in reverse for the other side of coruse, and the poitn is, he now frames all of hiw understandgn ofsociety from the Demcorstic politial persoetive that sees it as “Us VS Them”.If we stop trying to mak science VS Religion somehign thats real, if we simply repect others and acceptthat Relgiion as a term is just a construct andpeoepslbeelifs can both be questioend respetfully and treated fsirly, I think we’d see fewer problems.You dont need to depict Relgiion or “Fudnam4ntalists” in a bad Light, you just need to explanthe Sicnee. You dotn need to add a layr of Hosility to Theism to Science, just explain what we know now. Poepel can brign God into it on their own or leav ehim oi on their own.I think the conflcit is thus a cuktrually created one, thats useless and cna be diffused by simply abbandonign all hostile ovetures.The choice of Bruno was no mistake. He was chosen and presented in this way to foster controversy. The “religion is the enemy of science” viewpoint is very important to Atheist agitators like Seth MacFarlane. While Sagan wanted more people to embrace science, MacFarlane would be just as happy to have people reject science in the name of God. This would give him more targets to ridicule, which is of course his true calling. Christians should not bite on his bait. Reject Cosmos for its ham-fisted propaganda, but not for its science. Demand a program free from Atheist dogma. Remember, religion has faith and science, Atheism has only science, therefore, Atheism has nothing to offer. That’s why they want to take science from the rest of us.I see your words as far more divisive than the Cosmos episode.Which words, divisive of what, and how?Religion is shallow, boring and stupid anyway so who cares.Just three of the [many] reasons it is also the last great form of mind control.Seth MacFarlane did not write the script. It was written (without his input) by Ann Druyan and Steven Soter, who co-wrote the original with Sagan. I urge you to the episode. You will see that they included a great deal of Bruno’s actual writings about the infinite glory of God. The episode was definitely meant as an attack on the Church of the 16th century, and on the whole idea of limits on intellectual freedom, but it actually celebrated Bruno’s spiritualism.So you agree the episode was meant as an attack on the Church, but you believe it was limited to the Church as it was, not as it is now. I disagree, why attack the Church at all unless you are trying to say something relevant to today? I don’t know whose decision it was to include Bruno and to corrupt his story, but I can’t see it as anything but a deliberate move to cause controversy – and that screams Seth MacFarlane. But it doesn’t matter if I’ve got the wrong culprit, the crime is the same.If you have read my original post (and I hope you have) you know that I disagree with the way Bruno is portrayed in this first episode of Cosmos, but the extended use of Bruno’s quotes about the glory of God go strongly against your interpretation of the show’s motives. Was the show an attack on the Church of 1600? Well yes, of course it was. It was also, more broadly, an attack on those who would attack free expression of ideas. But keep in mind that the ideas the show is defending were themselves religious ideas.If you don’t agree with my assessment of the situation, please give me your best guess as to why Bruno was chosen, out of all the people in history, to be the “Hero of Science.” Would you be willing to bet that no one involved in creating that segment was anticipating a negative reaction from Christians?I’d be willing to bet that if they were trying to create a “Hero of Science” they would have picked, you know, a scientist, and they wouldn’t’ve described his theory of the stars as “a guess”.  Science, which is a method of creating and choosing between ideas, wasn’t the point of that segment.The segment on Bruno’s ideas focused on the idea that the stars were like the sun and that the universe is boundless.  Bruno’s attack on his enemies was not a scientific one; it was “Your God is too small!”  The major theme of the entire episode was the vastness of the universe.While Tyson/Druyan/Soter’s words were scathing towards the church of the time, they chose their words very carefully.  Note that they barely talk about the church itself, but frequently mention Italy as dangerous, and cap off the chunk of the show by mentioning separation of church and state and freedom of speech.  They’re taking aim at a political movement, not a religious one.In the context of science, in the context of politics, in the context of the United States, and in the context of a show that represents the universe by fitting it onto a calendar where each month corresponds to over a billion years?  There’s only one group of people they’re expecting a negative reaction from, and while most of them (here) are Christians, not all Christians belong to this group, not even the current pope.Are you a young-earth creationist?I am not now nor have I ever been a young-earth creationist. Why would you make that assumption? Because I am critical of Cosmos? Look where we are. Discover magazine is critical of the same show for the same reason. Are they young-earth creationists too? Powell and I are not arguing over the age of the universe, but over the motives of the producers of the show. Why would they spend so much time on a cartoon, that’s not about science, in the middle of a science program? Why would they produce a segment about history that gets so much of that history wrong? Seth MacFarlane is an Atheist and the voice of Bruno in the cartoon. I’m just connecting the dots in the most obvious way.That is one of the best defenses I have seen here of using Bruno in the episode. I still think the portrayal of Bruno was distressingly simplistic, but you make a good case. Thank you for that.The last bit about young-earth Creationism is rather besides the point, however, and adds fuel to the fire here.I see no point in trying to guess, or to attempt mind-reading. I’m just interpreting what I actually see on screen, and that does not support your point of view.Carl Sagan-Cosmos edited for rednecks – YouTube Here’s another time MacFarlane rebooted Cosmos. I don’t think I’m mind-reading or guessing – I’m just putting 2 and 2 together.Maybe because history has shown that “the church of then” can always and often easily become “the church of now”.  Religion has a many-centuries-long history of punishing people who are skeptical or dare criticize the church or religion, whether scientists or laymen, a trend which in some ways continues to today.And the tacky cartoon of the church official looking like an evil villain also screams Seth MacFarlane.MacFarlane also provided the voice for Bruno.Awww, christard mad. ” Atheism has nothing to offer.”And theism has just child rape to offer to humanity, proof is Islam and Catholic priests being covered up by the church, oh yea the same church that killed Bruno.@Kami3k, took you 2 years to come up with that word-vomit? You’re not a great commercial for your team.Speaking of splitting hairs–shouldn’t that read “Bruno *spent* two years”?Fixed–thank you.They did mention that Giordano Bruno read books that told him of all that stuff so I don’t think anyone is trying to say that he came up with it on his own.very likely. the idea of infinite worlds, Bruno wasn’t the first to come up with it or talk about it. prominent examples are Étienne Tempier (a bishop of Paris), who argued that an omnipotent God could create many worlds, even an infinity of worlds back in the mid 1200s, and Nicholas of Cusa (a cardinal), who wrote off and on about the possibility of other stars having other worlds with other life, even intelligent life, and this was in the mid 1400s.Cosmos could have done the show on either person, creating a story that would invite in a Christian audience, rather than turning them off from the show.Bruno wasn’t the first to come up with it? Did you even read my post? I said Giordano Bruno read books that told him of all that stuff. You must be religious.i was agreeing with you. you might want to re-read my post.So glad you provided a correct account of Bruno and Digges. I wish that you would have given us a paragraph on Atomist cosmology rather than a brief reference to Greek literature.This reinforces why I wasn’t interested in this show from the beginning despite being long interested in science and astronomy, it seems superficial and cheap. Yesterday I forced myself to start watching it and I couldn’t take it. The loose adherence to facts and lack of any insight combined with the overly dramatic bad acting and poor writing make it unwatchable.Another thing worth mentioning is that part of the problem was with the mathematical idea of infinity.  Mathematicians carefully avoided the idea of a “completed infinity”, and their instincts were certainly correct: inifinities and infinitesimals are weird ideas, and it is easy to make mistakes with them. Oh, and all we know about the physical universe is that it is very, very big and that we cannot see any edge or looping back around.  The possibility that the universe is in fact finite cannot be easily discounted, though, and there have been serious attempts to look for evidence of a finite universe in the CMB.  See, e.g., http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Is_the_Universe_finite_or_infinite_An_interview_with_Joseph_Silk.Thanks for this article. It’s one of the things I love about science in general – prove what you say or risk being proven wrong.This was an excelling review of Bruno. I truly appreciate it.By presenting the heliocentric system not as heresy but as an extension of classical learning, Digges pointed out a path forward: away from superstition and theological debatePersonally, I prefer any method that points a path away from superstition and theological debate. The less talk about what cannot be known in favor of talk about what can be known, the better.Einstein was one of the greatest intellects of our times and was also devoutly religious.  I personally am an agnostic. I believe if there is a God it is the sum of all life on the planet.  We are but fleas on the dog, arguing about which of us is really in charge.I think describing Einstein as “devoutly religious” is a bit of a misrepresentation of someone who described himself as an agnostic.then for the sake of argument, how about Lemaître, the father of the big bang theory?
or Copernicus, Roger Bacon, Gregor Mendel, Pasteur, Nicholas Steno, Francis Collins, or Enrico Fermi?If Jeff Nelson had opened by talking about Georges Lemaître I would not have accused him of misrepresenting Albert Einstein.In fact I feel this list sort of reinforces my point, which is that if you want to talk about devoutly religious scientists you should pick ones that are actually, you know, devoutly religious rather than describing an agnostic with pantheist leanings as “devoutly religious”.These quotes from him prove a belief in God if not in man,s religions:“Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that, behind all the discernible concatenations, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I am, in point of fact, religious.”“I believe in Spinoza’s God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind” tranlated from the original German language quoteThat’s god as an analogy for nature, or pantheism at best. Why are you trying to “claim” Einstein? Why would it matter if he was religious?My whole point was it is not necessary to pick one view or the other both can coexist to some degree.The “sum of all life on the planet” is not a god unless it has supernatural powers. It’s just a mistake to confuse poetic license and analogy for actual belief. Belief is a real thing. When people actually believe in a supernatural explanation for a thing, it excludes any natural explanation for that thing. Those two states don’t coexist to some degree. They’re opposite descriptions.Albert Einstein was deeply spiritual, but definitely not devoutly religious in any conventional sense of those words. For more on Einstein’s faith, see “Einstein and Religion” by Max Jammer, or my own book, “God in the Equation.”What is eternally amusing is that folks get so embroiled in arguments in which NEITHER SIDE can be made proveably right…  Let me just say; Science is obviously an excellent tool for exploring and attempting to understand the Universe we find ourselves in. Religion is not.
However, Science IS NOT A RELIGION. It, by it’s very underpinnings, cannot be said to be omniscient ( notice the root of that word? ) OR infallible, attributes often credited to God.
If you ‘believe’ in Science ( and it doesn’t care if you do. )  it is like ‘believing’ in Carpentry; a field of human endeavor which makes use of a set of tools to build a useful edifice, You can do it, most can be taught to do it and the results can be measured and valued. Same thing happens if you DON’T believe in it. But to look at say, a hammer, and then state unequivocally that tools and processes you don’t even have the math to describe are impossible and don’t exist, is stupid. and unscientific.
If all we can perceive and postulate at this stage in our evolution as a species is a tiny fraction of a miniscule bit of  a percent of what there is to know, I would be amazed, as we haven’t even gotten out of the crib we were born in yet. Kind of like a dog raised all it’s life in a fenced yard thinking it is master of all, and then asking it
 about the ISS.I surely appreciate the more deep insight at the “Real Giordano Bruno”, from whom i will keep reading on for the next days to verify the information. But from that to claim that the new tv show Cosmos has some responsibility or duty to conciliate science and religion is totally out of place. I think just like Dawkins point in his book “The God Delusion” the many times religious people quote scientists using the words “God” or “spiritual” your are misinterpreting the spirituality Carl Sagan talked about with religion, and by religion you are just talking about Catholicism, because if the program Cosmos would intend to reconcile science with religion, it would take one season for every religion it exists so science could please them all. No, religion an science don´t belong in the same place, they are not two sides of the same coin. The origin of both can be imagination(the same for an artist), that’s is the only point they converge but from there, they part ways in totally different directions, science is about facts, about evidence, is about verifying through scientific processes what you imagined is real, can be replicated, can be showed and applied. Religion is just about faith, about believing what you imagined and attributing it to a higher unknown entity with no evidence at all. Which in the long run it just becomes a tale, a myth, and if you keep believing it long enough, a delusion. Science is in constant change, pushing forward, always discovering, religions in the other hand, as far as i know, have this books written centuries ago which contain all you need to know about everything (except of course, when you need technology or medicine)So why science would have to rely someway on religion when its a stale, stagnant discipline? Religion will always be important from an historic point of view, because unfortunately it has influenced every other area through history, and not for good. So NO Sr. Keep religion out of my science program, just as i don’t go to your temples with books of the origin of species or my full DVD cosmos series. Religion is already mingling places it does not belong like politics and education, thats enough. And don’t worry, be reassured we have the right Hero @neiltyson, you can follow your imaginary one. I leave you with a quote of Carl Sagan.
“The idea that God is an over-sized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying… it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.”the entire Bruno segment was an excuse to bash on Christianity. it’s pretty obvious, and that makes it obviously out of place.why are they alienating an audience they should be trying to attract?The Bruno segment didn’t bash on Christianity per se, it bashed on the Inquisition.most people don’t make that distinction. regardless, i feel that Bruno was a very poor choice for a “hero of science” and that Cosmos should have picked a better one…I made that distinction. Anyway, I’ll agree to disagree about the Bruno choice.why do you support the decision of Cosmos to feature as a “hero of science” someone who contributed nothing to science?He’s a hero for the freedom of though, that’s enough.The modern scientific process didn’t exists at the time. This is a story about the dawn of the revolution from which it would eventually arise. That’s apt for a first episode.so why not Copernicus or Galileo, who actually contributed to that revolution?I’m sure they’ll be in later episodes!one may only hope. however, that simply casts a greater shadow on the poor decision to put Bruno in the first episode.You mean the great decision to put Bruno in the first episode?*terrible* decision. there, i fixed it for you.As a historian of science, I was appalled at the depiction of Giordano Bruno on Cosmos.  Thanks for setting the record straight.  For people who want to know more about the real Giordano Bruno, I recommend Frances Yates book “Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition”, a real classic in the history of science literature.  I can’t believe that the creators of Cosmos were so cavalier about human history when they are trying to build enthusiasm for the scientific pursuit of truth.That’s what I found the most annoying about it.  You can’t take the high road by following the low road.No one seems to mentioning the gratuitous montage of “medieval torture devices” during the trial scene, implying that Bruno was tortured with them.  There’s no evidence he was ever tortured, and if he was, it wasn’t with those devices, because they did not exist.  Those are relatively modern inventions.Thanks for mentioning that. I’ve been looking around to see if there’s any mention of Bruno being tortured, and I couldn’t find any.Yeah, showing torture implements was uncool.Despite popular myth that the Inquisition tortured accusers daily for years and years until they recanted, in fact they used torture very sparingly. It could be used only during the trial, only once, and any confessions extracted under torture were valid only if repeated without torture. As a matter of fact, the Inquisition used torture a lot less than the civil courts.I don’t think Bruno was tortured for the simple fact that the Inquisition used torture only to extract confessions and information during trial, and he never denied the accusations, quite the opposite.They were real bleeding hearts, those Inquisitors.Yes, that was inexcusable.  For one thing it makes me wonder what else they got wrong.  Given the cost of this production and the people involved, how does an error like that occur?  No one checked it out through the whole process?There are a lot of people here insisting that religion is anti-science, but it was Bruno’s concept of religion which caused him to posit the infinite universe/infinite worlds theory.  Therefore, according to you, his theory was anti-science, and he was burned at the stake for promoting not science, but a different concept of religion.  Why, then, should he be considered a “martyr” for “free thought,” and why would Cosmos dedicate one quarter of its episode run time to him?Q: Why did Cosmos dedicate a lot of time to this story?A: I can only speculate, only the writers can say for sure. It seems to satisfy many goals of the show. It’s a nice exposition of the dawn of astronomy. Bruno has some good quotes in there preaching about the value of free thought, regardless of whether or not this was the cause for his execution. Bruno is a good piece for bringing up the conflict between science and religion early. Those who relate to the heroic depiction of a theist who wants to open his mind and lean, will come on board. Grumpy atheists (myself excluded, by the way) will flush with righteous satisfaction that the show is catering to their hatred of the church. They’ll be mistaken, if they fail to consider the interpretation in former point (as I did, at first). Agnostics and deists and others who don’t care much either way will (as I did) experience a wonderful moment of awe and humility to the vastness of the Cosmos, as we are vicariously exposed to it for the first time, in sympathy with Bruno’s spectacular and poetic dream sequence.Q: Was Bruno martyr for science?A: I don’t feel comfortable
with that word, “martyr”. It’s defined by popular opinion, not any real
aspect of a person. A celebrity is really just a famous actor, for
example. Bruno is a famously killed heretic who had a conveniently
correct guess about the stars being other suns. He did promote free
thought, which makes for some nice quotations. The theory that the stars
 are other suns is not inherently anti-science. The inspiration for his
theory was partly his religious beliefs, but partly also Copernican
reasoning, which is, in fact, sound. In so far as the cause of his
theory was accepted on faith, it constitutes poor thinking on the part
of Bruno. That doesn’t make his being put to death any less stifling of
free thought. I wouldn’t begrudge anyone for calling him a martyr for science, and you haven’t shown me any reason why I should.Of course you wouldn’t; all of your posts make it clear that facts need not get in the way of a good narrative.  Which is exactly what science *isn’t* supposed to be about.It isn’t a matter of fact that Bruno was/wasn’t “martyr for science”. It’s a matter of opinion.Oh, I certainly understand that people label him a “martyr for science,” even though he did no actual science.  That says quite a bit more about those who would label him as such than it does about him or whatever happened to him.See my comment immediately above about not letting facts get in the way of a good narrative.He may not have had the entire scientific process down, but at the time, nobody else did, either.It’s not inconsistent with the facts to use Bruno as a symbol for the freedom of thought. That’s the message of the episode.Geez, dude.  “Not have the scientific process down”?  He wasn’t a scientist at all.  His astronomical ideas weren’t science, period.  He didn’t think of them as science.  It was part of his THEOLOGY.  Why is that escaping you?Because you don’t actually care, I would think.  Again, not letting facts get in the way of a good narrative.The way you tell it, because the creation myth in Genesis more or less follows what science says happened — sudden flash of light, the creation of the earth, then the sea, then the sea creatures, then the birds, then the animals, then people — well, that was “science”; they just “didn’t have the entire scientific process down.”It’s not inconsistent with the facts to use Bruno as a symbol for the freedom of thought. That’s the message of the episode.It’s certainly relevant that his astronomical ideas weren’t based in SCIENCE.  That’s what, among other things, you want to fudge over.Look, you’re clearly going to believe what you want to believe no matter what, so . . .Enjoy episode 2.I did.Why don’t you just come out and say it? Why the extended run-around with the irrelevant Digges comparison? You’re uncomfortable with Christians being upset. Too bad. Scientists need not self censor themselves. Bruno’s ideas were reflective of a natural philosophy that was not tolerated in the Roman Catholic Church.  In today’s world, many Evangelicals and many Republicans deny that there is any chance humans could be contributing to Climate Change/Global Warming. Why? Because God controls those things. It’s “heretical” thought to them and many are in positions of power. So if it wasn’t painfully obvious, the Bruno segment was a parable.Most of religion, and definitely the much-reviled Old Testament, is parable.  Why would a show promoting science deal in parables?  And if it’s going to make a specific point, why not actually make the point rather than tiptoeing around it, as you say it is by describing the segment as “parable”?  That in itself is the self-censorship you decry.Tell me this — what would have been lost if that segment wasn’t in the show at all, and instead the 25% of the show it consumed was spent exploring science?BTW, Bruno’s ideas were not reflective of a “natural philosophy.”  They were reflective of his own brand of theism.  That’s something they actually took pains to emphasize in the show — did you miss that part?So, you had an 11-minute cartoon depicting one person being burned at the stake for promoting not science, but a different theology.  What place does that have in a show promoting science?Bruno’s views were impressive, and not only for his public thoughts about an infinite universe. Cutting edge astronomy has only in the last few years found evidence of other earth sized planet-star systems, something he posited during a time when such a statement would be viewed as a direct denunciation of Church teachings about Creation. His concept that distant stars are like our home sun was visionary, and profoundly ahead of his time. Including the Bruno segment added something different from the usual prescriptive and linear telling of scientific thinking and discovery.But his views had nothing to do with *science*.  His views were another form of *theology*.  He just happened to turn out to be right about a few things.You still make it sound as though he was speaking scientific truth to religious power, but that’s not what he was doing, not even in his own mind.Isn’t there enough reality to talk about in science without having to make things up?  It sounds to me like you’re rationalizing the inclusion of something meant to bash religion because you agree with bashing religion.I don’t have a problem with the inclusion of a story about how the Roman Catholic church burned people at the stake who questioned or believed in a universe different then the (incorrect) one taught by the Church.  I don’t see that as religion bashing. I see it as a fact of history and part of the story, of how we as humans, have evolved our view and understanding of the Cosmos.When you are incorrectly, and gratuitously, promoting a story as something that it isn’t — Bruno was NOT burned at the stake for promoting science and refusing to recant — then you’re doing so because you’re working an angle.  And that angle is, indeed, the bashing of religion.  It couldn’t be anything but that.  It doesn’t make any SENSE as anything but that.Bruno contributed NOTHING to the “understanding of the Cosmos.”  He didn’t arrive at his views through any scientific means.  He just happened to believe things which coincided with reality, pretty much by accident, really, when what he was after was another form of religion. His was a creation myth no different from any other, save that it posited some things which have turned out to be true.  That’s not science.  That’s getting lucky.incorrect. Bruno’s natural philosophy was not unique within the church. the idea that there may be other worlds out there had been around for several centuries, in fact, there were a number of very important members of the church who had ideas like these, such as Étienne Tempier, who was a Bishop of Paris in the 1200s and who persuasively argued that an omnipotent God could create many worlds, and Nicholas of Cusa in the 1400s, who was a Cardinal and later became a Vicar of the Papal States, who wrote that the stars may be other planets, like Earth, and may be inhabited. the plain fact of the matter is that Bruno was killed for varous theological heresies, as were a few thousand other people during the Inquisition, and not for his vision of the cosmos. he was not particularly important to the history of science, and so his story is badly out of place in Cosmos for this reason.What was incorrect about my statement? My rebuttal to this terrible article is not hinged on any purity of “uniqueness” of Bruno’s ideas. What you have missed in your comment is that the Roman Inquisition and Bruno’s murder happened in the midst of one of the greatest paradigm shifts in recorded human history,  the Copernican Revolution. Galileo only escaped a similar fate because he appeased the church! Your two examples pre-date the Inquisition. They were not seen as embracing a new world view completely, but rather thinking about God and his omnipotent qualities from an earth-centric universe. Lastly, Cosmos is not “the history of science” there are basic lectures you can take on that at any university. Tyson highlighted an interesting and provocative figure, good for him.Galileo was NEVER — that is, NEVER — under the threat of death.  Not ever.  In fact, the Pope himself declared Galileo safe for as long as he (the Pope) lived, and that was before he recanted.  He wasn’t even on too-unfriendly terms with Robert Bellarmine.So, no, Galileo didn’t “only escape a similar fate” because he recanted.  He was never in danger of it.If you’re going to present yourself as a champion of academic truth, you should try a little harder to make sure you’re straight on the facts.This part specifically was incorrect: “Bruno’s ideas were reflective of a natural philosophy that was not tolerated in the Roman Catholic Church.”– My apologies, i should have made that clear in my original post. Also, the first official Inquisition started in 1184, and was permanently established in 1229. Both my examples are after that time. Galileo got himself into trouble. The Pope was one of his strongest supporters until Galileo wrote a paper that specifically made the Pope look bad. This was not a wise move on Galileo’s part, and resulted in him being put on trial and eventually put under house arrest. Even when he was under house arrest he still wrote papers and letters, and spread his ideas among the scholars of the time.Modern era states: “What you have missed in your comment is that the Roman Inquisition and Bruno’s murder happened in the midst of one of the greatest paradigm shifts in recorded human history, the Copernican Revolution.”This statement merely points out that the two events happen about the same time. It is not evidence that either was affected by the other. Perhaps (1) if Bruno had been burned at the stake purely because of his adoption of a Copernican view of the Universe OR perhaps, (2) if the Inquisition were solely a response to the Copernican revolution, then we could say that the two events had to do with each other.However, Bruno was not executed solely because of (nor primarily because) of his views on the universe. As to the Inquisition, there were a number of “heresies” at the time that were threatening to fracture the church into a many pieces. The Inquisition was a response to this danger. In any event, even if the two were somehow connected, what is the the reason this point is being made (that Bruno was executed at the time of this paradigm shift) on Cosmos?Ask the writers. To me, it seemed like an obvious tale of the beginning of the scientific revolution in an era where free thought was often suppressed, even by execution. Many people don’t actually know about that part of history. It’s relevant. It’s an important part of the history of science. It helps that he has a fun dream sequence and guessed about the stars being other suns.please name any scientists who were executed.I said “free thought was often suppressed, even by execution”. This doesn’t imply that any scientists were ever executed. I wish you’d stop misrepresenting my arguments with leading questions.perhaps you try to not say misleading things. particularly when they reinforce a stereotype that isn’t true.picky,picky,picky!     Give Giordan a break—–he tried really hard, using the limited technology available. They nailed the poor guy to the crossNo, they burned him at the stake, and he didn’t try to do science.  He was a theologian.It’s not a question of criticizing him; it’s the questionability of including that segment into a program dedicated to promoting science and fact.“Picky”?  Are you serious?  This is supposed to be a science show.  Not a show that revises history for an agenda.WOWWow yourself.  Educate yourself before you write a stupid sarcastic ‘wow’.  The Giordano Bruno cartoon on cosmos is revisionist history, do the research or stfu.For an alleged heretic, Burno’s revelation of infinite space, infinite worlds, and an infinite God reveals just how deeply science was influenced by the mysticism associated with religion, and how religion was compelled by the light of reason, and scientific inquiry to open its eyes to the infinite whole of God’s creation.As Einstein correctly pointed out, “Religion without science is blind, while science without religion is lame.”Perhaps, Pope Francis will someday make a Saint out of Bruno for his revelation of God, and creation as being infinite in scope, and not limited to just our world, or solar system: Saint Bruno, the Patron Saint of Scientific Inquiry?One can only hope that they will someday reconcile their differences.“a place where Catholic doctrine obviously did not hold the kind of sway that it did in Italy.”
Can anyone guess what Copernicus’s day job was?  He was a CATHOLIC priest. I love how the secular media tries to dig up these obsure figures instead of pointing out that many of the advancements in science were made by Catholics especially the Jesuits (who confirmed Galieo’s observations) who were known as “The Pope’s Men”.
For those of you who want to learn the truth about Galieo this is a good artical: archives.sspx.org/against_sound…/galileo_victim_or_villain.pdf
The main reason he got in the tangle he did was not beacuse of his science but because he was an a$$hole similar to Bruno.
 Also the reason Bruno was burned at the stake was not because of his pseudo science but because he held a heretic belief called Arianism in a time when heresies started wars:

Why are articles popping up seemingly attempting to justify why the church murdered an innocent man for simply being an individual with DIFFERENT views? You have missed the whole point, Cosmos made it clear why Bruno’s story was chosen and it was made clear he was not a scientist (he was religious again making that the whole point of telling his story for religious freedoms) nor was he chosen for advancement of the Copernican revolution. The whole point was to allow freedom of thought and to open your mind. Bruno arrived at the similar conclusions about the universe as Galileo without benefit of a telescope and though others may not have been burned for similar ideas, the same man, Cardinal Robert Bellarmine who prosecuted Bruno for the Inquisition also prosecuted Galileo who recanted
his discoveries because of Bellarmine’s urging and likely reminders of what happened to Bruno.   The Vatican “rehabilitated” Galileo,
but has yet to admit that ordering Rome’s civil authorities to burn Bruno after he refused to recant his opinions about the universe and other theological dicta like the mother of Jesus remaining a physically intact virgin before,during and after childbirth–an obvious physical impossibility, the suggestion of which is insulting to every woman who has given birth, while the Church claims to revere motherhood and forbids contraception. Bruno famously said”Truth  does not change because it is or is not believed by a majority of the people”. He endured 8 years of imprisonment and torture before
being burned alive on February 17,1600, with a stake through his tongue to prevent his eloquence from inciting the crowd.

Read the wonderful poem about Bruno, “What He Thought” by Heather McHugh”.I don’t think this article tries to justify why Bruno was murdered. Rather, it suggests that a less inflammatory (pardon the pun) hero would have been a better choice. This still does miss the whole point, that Bruno was a hero for freedom of thought.Thanks for the further information about Bruno.Freedom of thought?  Bruno was excommunicated for heresy, not for thinking outside the lines. Heresy is a rejection of core doctrines. Heresy is not “free thinking” it’s open rebellion against very particular aspects of the faith that are not negotiable (for example, the Trinity is not negotiable. The divinity of Christ is not negotiable. The Eucharist is not negotiable). He wasn’t excommunicated for his “scientific” musings, he was excommunicated for rejecting core doctrines of the faith. His philosophy had nothing to do with it.  He was excommunicated by the state for years of political crimes during his travels, not for his theology, or for his “science”.You have a funny definition of free thought. I’ve always taken “free thought” to mean coming to truths via logic, reason, and empiricism, rather than authority, tradition, or other dogmas.That’s like, exactly what Bruno said, “I beg you, reject antiquity, tradition, faith, and authority! Let us begin anew by doubting everything we assume has been proven!”You might accuse the episode of quote-mining to make a caricature of Bruno. But this caricature was of a hero for freedom of thought.Free thought is to the benefit of The Truth, we agree there.  Therefor free thought does not mean “believing whatever you want, simply because you wish it to be true”  Particularly when you’re a priest—a position of authoritative teaching.
“Free thought” is more than just exploring new ideas.   Besides, exploring new ideas is part of the legacy of the Catholic Church. Just look at every council in Church history. There’s a reason why councils last so long before they’re closed by consensus.  Look at the history between Copernicus, Galileo, and the Church.  I mean THE HISTORY, not what people say about the history.  Exploring new ideas is perfectly fine. Holding them as truth, and teaching them as truth is another story.
In keeping with his disingenuous  character, Bruno himself didn’t even abide by what you quoted.  He held a range of beliefs that were 1) Objectively illogical (any logician can see that) 2) Flatly unproven and/or 3) Had no basis of reasonable evidence.  And 4) Some of his beliefs UNIQUELY come from antiquity! Specifically Jewish Mysticism from antiquity. Finally, 5) It’s funny how someone posturing, and behaving as an authority is the first one to say “Reject authority!”.
So as we see, Bruno’s nonsense not only falls WAY short of valid scientific thought, it doesn’t even qualify as valid philosophical thought.  It’s little more than bar room chatting.  Yet he has become the new darling of anti-Catholic propaganda.  And if that is your “hero for freedom of thought” then I feel really, really bad for you.  You need to raise the bar. On yourself.I think freedom of thought does kind of rely on not getting burned for speaking your mind, even if what you have to say is illogical, unproven, baseless, heretical nonsense.(Did I miss any?)You missed a couple of things. This was in the 16th century, not 2014. Execution was common for capital crime (felony). We see it as brutal and over the top today buy we aren’t judging history from a modern standpoint we are discussing history from the perspective of the facts. THAT he was executed doesn’t mean anything. WHY it happened does. Second, He was executed for political crime. Not heresy. The punishment for heresy is exile not death.THAT he was executed means a lot to me. I’m pretty sure the list of charges against him were all heresies. http://themarlowestudies.org/Baines_Note.htmlWhoa, wait a second, you forgot to acknowledge that your “hero for free thought” is a liar and a plagiarizer, had no intellectual integrity, was a dead-poor philosopher and had even less merit as a scientist. That’s YOUR hero we’re talking about. So why should we respect anything more you have to say if a liar is your intellectual hero? Rhetorical question there. But ok, we’ll skip that part if you want.If you have a problem THAT he was executed I have a few bits of advice for you.
1. Get in a time machine and take it up with the culture at large and with the ruling class. He was executed by the government for political crimes. That is a fact. Not propaganda.
2. Ask yourself how many doctors, philosophers, theologians and artists (these are all REAL free thinkers!) were executed during the rise and reign of atheistic marxism and communism.  Atheistic political philosophy is responsible for more thought policing and executions than any era of Christian Europe could even aspire to!  That is fact. Not propaganda.
3. How many little free thinkers are killed in the womb because of abortion? At least 3,000 a day in the  U.S.. Their crime? Existing!  That is fact. Not propaganda. This godless/secularist philosophy  has resulted in ongoing legalized genocide and the objectification of the human person, and the human being.
Now lets get to your “research”  Where in those charges of heresy do you see anything related to science? How about philosophy?  Nowhere.  These were theological issues for which he was excommunicated. And if you work at a Microsoft support center and you tell callers that Mac OS is the best operating system in the world, and Windows sucks, you’d probably get fired.  (Uh oh! Thought policing!!!) Bruno was also excommunicated by the Lutherans, and the Calvinists, and those people EXECUTED folks by the thousands (especially Catholics) yet Bruno was not executed by either of them (that’s very meaningful. Give it a think).
Now bypass Google and go get a book. Look up his political crimes, and learn about what constituted treason during that era. Governments executed people for lower crimes than Bruno committed.  If that’s “crimes against free thought” then I say again you should jump in a time machine, go back there and set the whole of Europe straight. Because this was a cultural disposition, and a political norm throughout the kingdoms. Catholicism had nothing to do with it. Catholic priests/pastors were renowned for giving solace and protection to the accused and oppressed!  It wasn’t uncommon at all for the local Parish Priest to be executed alongside the accused (often political criminals) because the priest gave the accused solace and was deemed an abettor and equally guilty. That’s very common in our history, look it up. Or make it easier on yourself, and look up how many Catholics TODAY are murdered in the third world for protecting ethnic minorities (similar kind of thing).  That’s in our DNA, my friend. And murder is in yours.  All in the service of “free thought”, I’m sure!  i mean just look at who your heroes are.Please cite your sources, and I’ll gladly read them.You wouldn’t read anything thing I send you. None of you folks ever do. You never read my sources, you don’t click links I send (forget reading them….you people don’t even CLICK them!).   Atheists, the self-proclaimed, so-called “free thinkers”, have exhibited time and again that they are better-served by their ignorance and sensationalism than by facts  and information, which is why you all sound so stupid every time you open your mouths or comment online.  I won’t waste my time digging out books to qualify my education for you.   You don’t want sources, you want an excuse for denying that you’ve been beaten and that your hero has been exposed, and your justifications for considering him a hero have been disintegrated by reason.
Most of what I”ve shared is just plain logic that exposes your errors of thought, and the rest of what I’ve shared is substantial enough enough that you can easily do the work of verifying it on your own; I’ve given you a lot to go on. Have fun.The point that Bruno was a hero for freedom of thought is based on the modern hindsight that all free exchange of ideas is harmless. It’s not like the men of the Church were playing an act. Bruno was an Hermetic who used the Church’s own support to promote ideas that would lead people who followed them to Hell, and for them, Hell was as real as Detroit is for you and me. To commit an action that would make someone else go to Hell was an even worse crime than murder is today. To do that while using the Church’s support was the worst possible act of treason, and today those are still punished with death.It’s not like he was judged and condemned because the church saw what he was saying as a political threat, as so much people think, and as Cosmos tried to misrepresent. The Pope himself supported Copernicus and even cherished his ideas. Most of the scientific developments at the time were sponsored by the Church. Bruno was judged and condemned in the same way a cult leader who incites people to commit mass suicide today would be arrested and charged with 2nd degree murder.I think you’re right about modern hindsight.You say for them, hell was real. But that’s not what the word “real” means. I hear that their *fear* of hell was real enough. That’s part of what makes the Bruno story compelling. With our modern hindsight, killing someone out of an irrational fear of an imaginary place called hell seems particularly awful.Not only is a free exchange of ideas harmless, but the dogmatic controlling of ideas is harmful. I think Cosmos made this point pretty well.No. Now you’re using hindsight to judge with hindsight, which is particularly amusing. To bring up what “real” means as if it even could be discussed reasonably here is to open a door to play semantics on the subject.Today, for all legal purposes, we consider that there’s no afterlife. What if there’s, and it’s better than this one? That doesn’t mean our current justice system who condemns someone for inciting suicide is awful, it means it made the decisions based on the consensus available at the time.For your point that they feared Hell and Bruno was murdered due to their fears to be valid, the authorities who judged Bruno himself had to be afraid of him, and that’s nonsense. Their point was that he was speaking in the name of the church without the authority, since he left his order, and he was saying things that would cause innocent followers to go to hell, not them. When a judge forgets lenience in sentencing when dealing with a convict who threatens him in court, he isn’t doing that because he’s afraid of him, he’s merely following a legal principle. Yes, the free exchange of ideas may be harmless for legal purposes, and dogmatic controlling of ideas is harmful in any case, but Cosmos failed miserably to attribute that to the Catholic Church. Reinventing Bruno as a martyr for science and reason and against Church isn’t a new trick. Frankly, if they had used Ripoli, for instance, it would make a much better case, but he was a deist, and that won’t fit the show’s anti-religious agenda, and he can’t be so easily painted as a scientist like Bruno can.You cannot dismiss as “hindsight” my disbelief in the *reality* of some fictitious place called Hell. Feel free to challenge it, though! I won’t burn you at the stake or anything.I absolutely condemn anyone who terrorizes others with tales of Hell. Preaching hellfire is emotionally abusive. This was as true in 1600 as it is today. The truth doesn’t depend on “historical perspective”.Still, I am compassionate towards these people of history who *lived* in an historical context that included entrenched dogma of Hell and the likes. That’s the point Cosmos was making. Back in those days, things were different. There are people watching this TV show who don’t know much about it! Teaching them as much as possible in 45 minutes is their “agenda”. Obviously.Of course I can, when you use that to give moral judgement on the actions of the 17th century church. That’s precisely what hindsight is.The truth doesn’t depend on historical context.That’s rhetoric nonsense. Again, that’s precisely what hindsight is. My hindsight (unavoidable, since I wasn’t alive at the time) doesn’t make Bruno any more or less a hero for freedom of thought.You gave an informative explanation about why Bruno was put to death. Then you concluded Cosmos has an anti-religious agenda. That doesn’t follow.Sorry, but you’re not being consistent enough to be taken seriously. First, what you’re saying can’t be taken as hindsight. When I show that doesn’t make sense, you change it to saying hindsight is unavoidable, while using it as an excuse for even more.I said “dismissed” as hindsight. By that, I mean my argument can’t be dismissed for any fact of (unavoidable) hindsight that I may hold.Honestly, I haven’t given much thought to hindsight before. How can hindsight cause trouble for a critical thinker?Same rhetoric nonsense. You have an excuse for the argument until your hindsight is brought to light. Once it is, you can reevaluate it, but instead you went even further with it.I think Bruno serves as a valid hero for freedom of thought. I don’t think Hell is real. I deplore the actions taken by the church of the 1600s. How might my re-evaluation of hindsight change these?Bruno wandered Europe picking up fights with everyone because he insisted on presenting his ideas as absolute fact without consideration for opposing views or any evidence beyond his Hermetic beliefs. The compass episode mentioned in the articles is from when he criticized  Fabrizio Mordente’s invention of the eight-pointed compass, while at the same time using it for his Hermetic studies. When Mordente replied the criticism and pointed his contradiction, he called him a “triumphant idiot”, for not realizing the Hermetic potential of his invention, and had to run from Paris when Mordente got support of the Duke. As someone else said here, to present Bruno as a hero of any sort is hagiography.In order to deplore the actions taken by the Church of the 1600s against Bruno without hindsight, you have to applaud people condemned of inciting to suicide and crimes today. Do you do that?That’s a false analogy! Bruno didn’t incite people to commit suicide!You don’t prove an analogy false by treating it as a comparison. I didn’t said Bruno incited people to commit suicide.You’ve concocted a small-minded logic problem where you equate eternal damnation in Hell with suicide. Anyone who takes Hell seriously would have a moral obligation to keep people out of there. I agree.But it’s *immoral* belief to believe Hell is real! It’s not supported by any evidence, and it cause people to suffer needless anguish.It was as immoral then as it is now.I don’t begrudge people of the past their lack of critical thinking. That doesn’t change my judgement of the morality of their beliefs and actions. I do have empathy and understanding for their predicament, and I know full well how privileged I am, looking back on those dark times with hindsight.No. I established an analogy between inciting people to commit suicide in a society that considers that a serious crime, with deceiving people into do things that would cause them to go to Hell, in society that considers that the worst possible crime.“But it’s *immoral* belief to believe Hell is real!”OK. You have to prove that.Sorry, you type faster than I do. Please see my above comment.Sorry, your above comment doesn’t prove what you say, and your little thought experiment is a petitio principii. It doesn’t answer anything. Why would be immoral for you to insult me?Sorry, I avoided being graphic out of caution to avoid sounding threatening, even in analogy.Please replace “insult” with any form of abuse that causes you suffering or harm.It doesn’t solve the problem. Why is that immoral?It would be immoral for me to hold this belief without evidence which results in my causing you needless harm.I could, and should, just give up that belief. It’s a moral obligation.You keep answering the question by rephrasing the same problem. I don’t know if you do that out of malice, or if you really don’t understand how you’re only dodging the question.Why is it immoral to hold  without evidence a belief that causes someone needless harm?1. Immorality means not conforming to accepted standards of morality.2. Morality concerns the set of principles distinguishing between right and wrong.3. The following principle distinguishing between right and wrong is an accepted standard of morality: It’s wrong to hold without evidence a belief that causes someone needless harm.You may at first object to the principle, but you’ll probably find that, upon examination, you adhere to it. The evidence strongly supports its being an accepted standard of morality. For example, all laws of all cultures protect people from abuse at the hands of even delusional perpetrators. Such delusional peoples may be treated with leniency if their delusions are truly insurmountable due to mental illness. Religious delusions are sometimes exempted. This, too, is immoral as judged by the majority of people.Nice play, but no cigar. You claimed your morality puts you above hindsight when making moral judgement because it’s the truth. The conclusion from your proposition isn’t that, but it’s merely that it’s the accepted standard of morality by your society. When you made moral judgement based on that, it isn’t even hindsight, it’s simple pretentiousness.I don’t object to the principle, I can agree with it as a premise for your reasoning, but only as a belief. Your claim was that’s the truth.A hint: what you’re defending here is called Harm Principle, which is a very simple-minded utilitarian principle. You want to believe in that? Go ahead, but your claim was that it’s truth, and puts your moral judgement based on it above others. To prove that, my friend, goes a long way beyond anything you said here, and probably anything you can say.I never said my morality puts me above hindsight. Hindsight is understanding of an event only after it has happened or developed. How does that invalidate any of my claims? Hell isn’t real. It was immoral for Bruno to have been burnt at the stake. Bruno serves as a valid hero for the freedom of thought.You said your judgement wasn’t hindsight because you weren’t merely forward in time, in comparison. You said it wasn’t hindsight because it wasn’t the truth. Since you retracted that preposterous claim and now admits it’s only your personal opinion, it’s fine.No, what I said was, whether or not my view of history is influenced by hindsight, my argument is sound.And yet my personal opinion about X (see above) is only one small part of the opinion held by all people on Earth.My argument is that most people on Earth would vote X be added to the book of morality. Look around you, they already have.So ubiquitous is this principle of morality that kids these days may not even realize it was once very unpopular.That’s why Bruno was featured in this episode.Your argument isn’t sound unless you prove why your standard of morality is above any other. No matter how many semantic games you play, that’s the essence of your claim.Yours is the impossible standard, that of objective moral truths which can be proven.There exists no such thing.You’re the philosophy guy, you should know that.I’ve done my best to make a case for X. That’s all one can hope to do when arguing morality!If you disagree, why don’t you just come out and say it? Dismissing my defense of X on the grounds of moral relativism is cowardice.Let the guy at least save some face on the exit. Calling his claim preposterous was completely unnecessary.Thanks Mark. He does have a point, though. See, preposterous claims are those contrary to reason or common sense.We’ve mostly been talking past one another partly because I’m lacking an education in philosophy. Some of what he takes for common sense, I’ve never even heard of before!I do think that Pedro happens to be suffering a severe case of myopia, though, and is applying bogus philosophical arguments to rather banal issues.It’s common sense to the rest of us that Hell was never as real to anyone as Detroit is for you and me, because the former is fictional while the later is geographical.It’s common sense to the rest of us that Bruno was *not* judged and condemned in the same way as would a cult leader who incites people to commit mass suicide today. There’s an enormous difference between the two scenarios, if not for the same reason above, than for the reason that the Inquisition had immoral laws.This judgement of morality may be hindsight, but it seems to be common sense to all of us except Pedro.Given the disparity between common sense as we see it, and common sense as Pedro sees it, his use of the word preposterous is understandable.Somewhat like scientific theories, morality evolves over time.If we follow the scientific method, our scientific theories can better approximate the Cosmos.If we are follow a similar process, our morality, too, can better approximate what we all share in our hearts.Unlike electrons, humans vary in their individual moral conclusions. When I talk about morality, in general, I refer to what we can agree upon today, which is different (and better, in my personal opinion, as a person living today) from what was agreed upon in the year 1600.Let X be the claim that, “it’s immoral to hold  without evidence a belief that causes someone needless harm.” That’s a rule that we can write down in the book of morality.It’s my personal opinion that X belongs in the book of morality.It’s also my personal opinion that today, across the Earth, X currently holds a firm seat in the book of morality.Sorry that this wasn’t clear before. I’ll take responsibility for making my own relativism sound like absolute without noticing it. Sorry.OK. Now it’s fine. It’s your personal opinion, it’s not the truth. Good. That’s all I needed to hear.The difference is, one society is wrong. That matters. A lot.Again, that’s hindsight. From their point of view, your society is wrong.No, because my beliefs are based on the scientific method, which includes a demand for evidence. An hypothetical person of the 1600s can make no such claim. That’s the difference. It’s important.Please, don’t try to play me. What makes your beliefs better than anyone else’s?In this case, fact that I have the privilege of way more evidence of way better quality.I’m sorry you feel like I’m trying to play you. I intend to be honest, respectful, and kind. I will keep trying very hard to ensure my posts contain these three.It really and truly is my honest opinion that some of my beliefs, particularly the ones on the topic at hand, are closer to the truth than those of people in the 1600s. You may feel this is hubris on my part, but I respectfully disagree.Well… either you are playing me, or you have a knack for trying to make your own relativism sound like absolute without noticing it.The people in the 1600 also had the honest opinion that their beliefs were much closer to the truth than yours. I have the honest opinion that my beliefs are much closer to the truth than yours.Saying that you have more evidence doesn’t mean anything, since the premises you use to judge the evidence can’t be recursively confirmed by evidence to infinity, and are subject to the same problem.I know you really want to believe you are better in knowledge and morality than those people. I can even understand that. But so far, your attempt to prove your moral superiority only proved your pretentiousness to give absolute moral judgement while not realizing the relativism of your own arguments to defend that.I don’t know what you mean by “absolute moral judgement” or “relativism”.I’m not a philosopher. I’m a scientist. I see everything through that lens. This is a virtue! Science is a process for finding things out. It works a lot better than any alternative.Hell yes, I claim moral superiority over the church of the 1600s when it comes to burning a man at the stake! How that is pretentious?I don’t go around claiming knowledge of things without having a good reason. I do claim that there isn’t a Hell. I think that’s a straightforward claim with a large body of evidence to back it up.You didn’t claimed you have good reasons to believe the 1600s church was immoral. You claimed it was immoral because your standard of morality is truthful, and theirs wasn’t. Look… I’m just asking you to stand up to your claims. If you’re angry because you can’t, it’s not my fault, it’s yours. It was you who adopted a particular view as truth and made public claims about it without knowing if it’s truth or not. It wasn’t me. I know you’re a scientist. It’s obvious. I am a scientist too, and I’m also a philosophy student. I used to think exactly like you, and I decided to study philosophy because someone also shown me how I was doing the same you’re doing, making unsubstantiated claims about it without knowing anything about it. You know that old saying, “when everything you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail?” That’s what you’re doing.You say there’s a large body of evidence to back up your claim that there isn’t a Hell, but you don’t even know what Hell is. You called Hell a place, but in the Catholic Doctrine Hell isn’t a place, Hell is a personal state! No body of evidence can prove that doesn’t exist, no more than it can prove my own consciousness doesn’t exist. You think you have good reasons because you never studied and understood the problems you make unsubstantiated claims about.You can claim everything you want. A claim is a promise that you can prove what you’re saying. It’s worthless without proof, and so far, the claim that matters on this conversation is that your simple-minded utilitarian standard of morality is the truth. Well… I won’t insist on it since you’re obviously getting angry, but you not only haven’t proved that, you also don’t even know that it’s impossible to prove it. It’s a principle you have to hold in belief.Since you’re a physicist, here’s a quote from Paul Feyerabend that might inspire you into going a little beyond the narrow scope of science:The withdrawal of philosophy into a “professional” shell of its own has had disastrous consequences. The younger generation of physicists, the Feynmans, the Schwingers, etc., may be very bright; they may be more intelligent than their predecessors, than Bohr, Einstein, Schrödinger, Boltzmann, Mach and so on. But they are uncivilized savages, they lack in philosophical depth.Please don’t presume I’m angry. I appreciate you challenging me to stand up to your claims. Again, thank you!This is a straw-man of my position in this conversation: “You claimed it was immoral because your standard of morality is truthful, and theirs wasn’t.”In the very first post you addressed to me, you said: “Bruno was judged and condemned in the same way a cult leader who incites people to commit mass suicide today would be arrested and charged with 2nd degree murder.”These are not at all the same *way* of condemning a man. The difference is, one society has X in it’s book of morality, the other does not.I said “The difference is, one society is wrong. That matters. A lot.” When I used the word wrong, I assumed you knew I meant “wrong as per the principles laid out in the book of morality on Earth in 2014.” It’s a common short hand for people to use right and wrong as facts conflated with the general acceptance of those facts. We were talking past each other, and I own my half of that.There remains a difference between those two *ways* of condemning a man. One is by writing laws according to X, and one without. The former is good, the later is bad (says a person on behalf of the generally accepted morality of his time in the year 2014).Another person living in 2014 might beg to differ. Do you?I would side myself with Feynman over Feyerabend any day.Choosing sides when it comes to knowledge isn’t the smartest thing to do.Frankly, if that’s all you have to say as a reply to this post, I think this conversation between us serves no more purpose. Glad to meet you. Good luck.What a silly thing to say!False by example. I choose sides on evolution vs. creationism, which happens also to be the smart thing to do.I didn’t choose sides based on some base affinity for Feynman, but for well-earned respect for his methods and opinions.Q.E.D.What was proved? Evolution by natural selection is the origin of species. Creationism, if/when makes any predictions, is falsified. I chose the scientific theory over the unscientific alternative religion has to offer.That’s the smartest thing to do!There is a whole area of science called neuropsychology which studies how the brain works to produce a mind. Evidence from this field of study has shown that our minds are a product of our brains. If you destroy the brain, you destroy the mind. This leaves no room for an afterlife.I won’t harass anyone who chooses to privately believe in an afterlife. But if they believe in an afterlife of torment to punish people for sins in this life, they are going to get in trouble. That belief is without evidence and contradicts what evidence we do have. It is harmful, and therefore immoral under X (said as one man on behalf of the accepted moral principles in his time of 2014).Many people hold X but give special exemption to the Catholic Doctrine Hell. This is illogical.I strongly reject your criticism “the premises you use to judge the evidence” as circular logic. When I say evidence, I’m talking about real things like a photo of the Earth from space. There is no premise on which I judge that photo. It’s just a photo. I can just point to Italy in the photo. The educated person from the 1600s, if educated in geography, will recognize his homeland in that photo. That doesn’t recursively depend on anything. It depends on what’s shown in the photo!I never said circular logic. I said evidence can’t be used to validate evidence recursively to infinity. There’s one point where you have to admit you don’t have further evidence you just believe in some principle that holds the chain together.Anyway, the issue here is morality, and you can’t prove morality with an inductive method like empiricism. To use your expression, it may give you a very good reason, but not truth.You strongly reject the problem of induction? Well… good luck.No. I haven’t studied the problem of induction. What I rejected is your claim that beliefs based on better evidence a la the scientific method run into any such problem.Evidence isn’t some philosophical problem. It’s photos and measurements and real, tangible things that are ideally made accessible to all inquiring minds.I hope you haven’t confused my belief that Hell isn’t real, which is based on evidence, for our other discussion about morality.“Evidence isn’t some philosophical problem.”Man… I won’t insult your intelligence by assuming you really mean that, because I know you don’t have a clue what you’re talking about. Seriously, study philosophy before making any claims regarding it.“I hope you haven’t confused my belief that Hell isn’t real”You do have a knack for changing your claims, don’t you? You never said you believe Hell isn’t real. You said it doesn’t exist as a categorical fact. If you’re retracting that to a personal belief now, I’m relieved.I didn’t choose the best words in that second quotation. Yet both things are true:1. I believe hell isn’t real.
2. Hell isn’t real.When I say evidence isn’t some philosophical problem, I mean to counter your over-indulgence in philosophical minutia about a really prosaic statement, that there’s plain, simple evidence for certain claims, and that we can trust in a common-sense interpretation of that evidence.For example, that hell is a fictitious place.“… for them, Hell was as real as Detroit is for you and me.”No, that’s not true, because evidence.Bruno was a crank, to be sure, and the Cosmos account borders on hagiography. But his cosmology was also far more daring than Digges’s. Bruno abandoned the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic  notion of the heavenly spheres; Digges just reshuffled them. Thus what Bruno means by “an infinite universe” is in its physical manifestation quite different from what Digges means.Galileo’s ideas about the universe didn’t upset all the inhabitants of Europe.  To the Jews, who counted astronomy as an important undertaking, and weren’t wed to a Copernican concept in the first place, Galileo’s assertions were hardly disruptive.  Where they differed from Galileo was in their willingness to stand for their beliefs unto death.  Jews were extensively martyred by the Inquisition;  Galileo  recanted.Nonsense. Galileo had the support of the Pope himself to publish his ideas as hypothesis, but decided to mock him by attributing his geocentric ideas to the foolish character in his dialogues. The whole Galileo affair was a political issue, since the Pope couldn’t allow him to get away with trying to ridicule him after giving him support for publication.Jews were extensively martyred by the Inquisition? You need to read something about the Inquisition written in the last 30 years. The Inquisition couldn’t bring jews to trial. Those who ordered the expulsion and killing of all jews were the civil authorities, not the church. The Inquisition could trial only the converted jews who were accused of practicing judaism secretly, while pretending to be christians to circumvent the civil law.Don’t bring facts to a knife fight.I am not concerned with the series “Cosmos” or every other’s
political agenda. What I feel it is really constructive is that people
want to know more about Giordano Bruno. Actually he believed in the
unity of religion and science. Yet another religion of the dogmatic
versions of it and another science of the blind materialistic versions
of it. Matter for him was divine and Divinity material. Both

The next stop in our journey (life after life) is a “spirit world”. The “spirit world” is filled with science that we can not fully comprehend or grasp while we are here on Earth confined to the laws of humans living in the flesh. So far what we know is God is light filled with unconditional love that welcomes and fills our spirit upon our transition from Earth to the “spirit world”. Based on accounts, God is located in a place that can be reached within a short period of time while outside of the body. However, this is a place where things such as distance, the body, space, time, verbal language, sound, and thought are all merged together. In this place of unknown science Identity is much less individual and far more connected to all the things including what we’ve learned and experienced here on Earth. Death is not a end. It has been described time and time again as a quick, smooth, and natural transition of the spirit from this place to the next.  Since the days of Plato to the present humans that die some for over an hour– their hearts stop and their brain activity ceases to function — that are resuscitated back to life all explain similar experiences.These NDEs (Near Death Experiences) can be studied and researched going back thousands of years. More recently a neurosurgeon by the name of Dr Eben Alexander had a NDE which he explains in his NYTimes best seller “Proof of Heaven”. Understanding what happens when we leave the body and this Earth will give everyone a much clearer picture of life, science, religion, God, and all things which are connected. Rather than argue the differences, it’s best to use that energy to research, explore, and try to understand the connections. Here is a link to some recent NDEs that will help you get a better understanding of how “Science” and “God” are connected. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgBdf1GqNlAFor a list of thousands of accounts of NDEs and life after life here is great link. http://iands.org/nde-stories.htmlChris Manhattan

An objective science show with pinpoint accuracy, it is not.Let me break this down for the masses…the difference between RELIGION and things like SCIENCE and even PHILOSOPHY:RELIGION(S) *start* with a specific set of ideas/beliefs…then *working backwards* from these conclusions, they attempt to explain the world in ways that are self-consistent with the original assertions.  they approach “science or philosophy” by STARTING with the answers to the problem/questions and then find explanations that will support their original answers.  if during this process some evidence contradicts their original conclusions, they do not consider the possibility that their “answers” could be incorrect…this is an obvious bias in their method of explanation.SCIENCE/PHILOSOPHY starts with no preconceived ideas, beliefs and/or answers…..as such it only attempts to explain the world using things like evidence, experiments, and logic.  it attempts to answer questions of science/philosophy by asking more questions and then testing ideas out.  if they find evidence that contradicts an earlier conclusion, they immediately consider that their original “answer” was incorrect.  in these fields, biases are frowned upon and are rigorously removed from the process when possible.   they do not START with a conclusion and then only consider evidence that will support these original claims.  in fact, they do the exact opposite….whenever they arrive at an answer, they are looking for evidence that would prove them wrong.  i do not believe science and theism are incompatible….but I absolutely do not like when people try to mix them to support a preconceived idea.  there are plenty of ways to accept both religion and science and IMO, religion should be about FAITH anyways, not science.Ofcouse he was arguing a lot, he was right and the stupid ignorant christians were against him.Your vision of Bruno’s tought is extremely reductionist. You make him appear as a dogmatic philosopher. It’s true, he was not a scientist, but that doesn’t make him merely an “ideologue”; it’s true to say he was a preceptor. And why does it matter who was first? That makes Bruno a plagiarist of Digges? Bruno was anything but a plagiarist, he was always concerned of making his own the ideas of others by transforming them, not just repeating them. Please, read ‘Idiota Triumphans’, and you’ll see the polemic was not about “the proper use of a compass”. Now, if the point is to show who made the best Copernicus’s lecture, and who made the best reverence, then who are the “ideologuists”? Please, stop dismissing people and toughts just because they don’t fit in this new trend of us called ‘science’. Like Adorno and Horkenheimer said time ago, science is the new myth. What’s really ironic, is that this new myth is fiercely aggressive with others not -too much- different from it.300 BC – 210 BC – Aristarchus of Samos. Greek astronomer and mathematician. He is considered the first person to propose a scientific heliocentric model of the solar system, placing the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the known universe. He correctly deduced the other planets in correct order from the Sun.http://www.spaceandmotion.com/cosmology-history-astronomy-universe-space.htmIn all honesty, I suspect the reason they picked Bruno was because his death enabled them to make a more interesting story.Giordano Bruno should have initially been branded a controversial character and heretic; not a hero, for there was nothing heroic about his life that would place him above that of Nicolas Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler or Thomas Digges.  Bruno’s life was controversial because while his interest was theology, he challenged the Roman Catholic Church teachings at its very basic core. The belief systems were deeply rooted and accepted by followers. In addition to denying key tenets of faith, Bruno, made several enemies and there were eight charges made of him by the Roman Inquisitors.
Bruno was more mathematician and magician and a amateurish astronomer rather than scientist. He was a philosophy professor later and a sarcastic, unpopular and argumentative person.
However, Bruno did have innovative thinking about other worlds like Earth in the cosmos where God and souls existed. He did consider animals and the Earth to have a soul which is among the more memorable belief contributions of Bruno. He was brilliant, argumentative and a difficult person with complications; perhaps Bruno is debateable a tragic hero.
As Bruno was quite disliked, it would have probably been better if COSMOS were to have had more attention on Thomas Digges, a great visualizer and artist who drew what he imagined in what I think was one of the first scientific illustrations of the infinite space/universe concept.
I suppose the fate of Bruno was his unfortunate just desserts for he created a terrible ruckus for a multitude, stubbornly persisted as a controversial character, angered many and got burned.SCIENCE has existed and functioned a lot longer than CHRISTIANITY or RELIGION has existed and functioned. Debate this?“He (Digges) also implicitly presented science as a cumulative intellectual journey, with each generation expanding on earlier ideas, testing their validity, inviting further questions.”Let us not be confused by that statement.  Climate ‘Science’ has turned real science on its head.  Never QUESTION.  Never TEST VALIDITY.  Only the CONSENSUS (of a tiny scientific subset of government-kept ‘climate’ scientists) of ‘scientists’ can have any validity at all.  PUH-LEASE!!!!So a guy needed to be burned at the stake just for some unorthodox beliefs?Whether he was a scientist, or philosopher, makes very little difference to me.  He had grasped the important ideas and after all, was a lot closer to being correct than the Catholics that BURNED him ALIVE.  The Catholic Church is indefensible on this account, and are still too stubborn and closed to admit it.  If he was difficult so what? Galileo was wise to just not get into it with the inquisition, but that doesn’t mean the Church was justified.  The church should apologize for every single execution, whether  by hanging, burning or other torture.  They need to apologize for all their sins, the list is long.  I don’t know if your point is to say Bruno asked for it or not.  Thomas Diggs does deserve recognition but he was lucky he was in England, not in the lands of the Inquisition.i believe we should be celebrating Giordano Bruno’s Birthday every year!Excuse me you idiots  but “science”  is a human term to help us understand whats is.And this human term  “Science”  may or may not  compliment  God,  (not religión.)Because it depends, If what  is being said favors  the interest of the Élite or those in control.*Wizrd*Corey S.

562	TVPrintThe first episode of Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, the 13-part miniseries that made Carl Sagan a household name in the early 1980s, opens with Sagan standing on the precipice of a seaside cliff. He wears an orange anorak and is dwarfed by the ocean. As the wind whips his bowl cut around the planetary roundness of his forehead, he speaks of grand mysteries, of our little Earth poised somewhere between immensity and eternity. “I believe our future depends powerfully,” he says, tromping across a moor, “on how much we understand this cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.”Sagan liked to call the universe “cosmos.” It lent an air of ceremony to the proceedings, an acknowledgement of the subject’s mythological infinitude. Such grandiosity was part of his shtick: He paid deference to high culture at both of its antipodes, with language cribbed from literature and ideas drawn from pure science. It was his way of giving the public some credit. He didn’t believe in dumbing things down, only in zooming things out, so that the big picture could be visible to anyone with a naked eye.Cosmos was dedicated, Sagan wrote, “to the proposition that the public is far more intelligent than it has generally been given credit for; that the deepest scientific questions about the nature and origin of the world excite the interests and passions of an enormous number of people.” This vote of confidence paid off. In 1980, the year it premiered, Cosmos’s viewership represented about 3 percent of the population of planet Earth; in the intervening years, it’s been seen by some 500 million people. Until it was dethroned by Ken Burns’s The Civil War in 1990, it was the most widely watched series in the history of American public television.Sagan felt that we are all, in a very real sense, made of star-stuff, that we are “part of the cosmos, born from it, our fate deeply connected with it.” In suit, the only real agenda of the original Cosmos miniseries was secular humanism built to resonate on an emotional level, a worldview in which the search for truth alone — amid the numinous vastness of the universe — might satisfy the stirring of our souls.Thirty-four years later, that same seaside cliff opens Fox’s remake of the series, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson. It takes a special kind of hubris to fill Sagan’s shoes, especially while standing on a precipice, but Tyson digs his heels in. He dispatches with the nostalgia quickly: “A generation ago, Carl Sagan stood here and launched hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure,” he says, adding gravely, “it’s time to get going again.”In many ways, Cosmos was ripe for a remake. As Tyson notes, a generation has passed, and Cosmos’s cultural capital has earned interest in the transition into the new millennium; the popular YouTube series “Symphony of Science” Auto-Tuned Sagan’s greatest Cosmos moments to the delight of nearly nine million viewers, and Tumblr — that great indicator of zeitgeist — abounds with GIFs of Sagan traveling the universe in his dun-colored corduroy suit.Some of this is due, presumably, to a remastered version of Cosmos that aired on the Science Channel in 2005. It struck a nerve with a new generation of viewers, myself included; its trippy soft-focus effect sequences felt both nostalgic and somehow very current. The first episode came prefaced with an appearance by Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, who noted that even after 20 of the most tumultuous years in the history of science, “Cosmos requires few revisions and indeed is rich in prophecy.”This may have been true in 2005, but the Tyson-fronted reboot comes in the midst of a revolution in planetary science. Just last month, astronomers announced a bonanza of some 715 new exoplanets — planets outside our solar system — nearly quadrupling the tally of alien worlds discovered by NASA’s Kepler space telescope. Sagan, whose own scientific research focused on precisely this kind of thing, would have been delighted; A Spacetime Odyssey, if it wants to stay current in such an active period of discovery, has its work cut out for it.Cosmos: A Personal Voyage was a labor of love. Like the remake, it was co-written by Druyan, Sagan’s third wife, whom he met while working on the Voyager Golden Record project at NASA. The Golden Record, if you’re not familiar, is a gold-plated LP affixed to the sides of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes, a cosmic mixtape of greetings from Earth, music, animal sounds, and — significantly — a recording of Druyan’s heartbeat. Of course, it’s likely aliens would take the Voyager Golden Record for a piece of space garbage; Sagan himself called it a “symbolic statement rather than a serious attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial life.”The Voyager probes are now the farthest man-made objects from Earth, 19,024,807,778 kilometers away as of this writing. Sagan died in 1996; the Golden Record is his eternal flame. It makes a cameo in Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, scooting past the porthole of Tyson’s updated “Ship of the Imagination” in its journey from Earth to the edge of the observable universe, across a smorgasbord of whirling dust clouds and iridescent comets.Cosmos: A Personal Voyage was modeled on — and produced by the same team as — The Ascent of Man, a 1973 BBC series tracing human history through science, whose presenter (Jacob Bronowski), like Sagan, made eloquent unscripted monologues against visually arresting natural backdrops. Both are 13-part series with a keen, almost romantic sense of the natural sublime. What they lacked in special effects, they made up with grandiose plays of scale on our own planet: Bronowski expounding on the chemical elements from within an enormous medieval salt mine; Sagan with his cliffs and moors.Much of the premiere episode of Fox’s Cosmos, however, is so mightily and spectacularly computer-generated that it lends the entire scientific enterprise a fictional air. The change in subtitle — from a “personal voyage” to the rather more ambitious “space-time odyssey” — seems about commensurate with the upgrade in production values. Tyson witnesses the Big Bang, glides across a cosmic calendar, and swoops over roiling interplanetary vistas in a sleek glass marble. Shooting this, one imagines, must have required a lot of time indoors; a faint lime halo from the green screen seems to encircle his profile.Tyson is an accomplished educator and a more than capable television host. He has gravitas and enthusiasm in spades. As the most visible public scientists of their generations, however, he and Sagan have different styles. Tyson made headlines late last year for aggressively debunking, via Twitter, the scientific plot holes in Gravity; Sagan, a concerted pot smoker, would probably have appreciated the film’s attempt to instill an awe of space in a mass audience. Fortunately, with Druyan at the helm as executive producer and writer, some balance is struck between these two sensibilities, products of their respective eras: Cosmos 2.0 retains the original’s literary tone, its emphasis on the scientific project as a grand human undertaking, while letting Tyson be Tyson. There’s even a Pluto joke.The original Cosmos wasn’t just a television show; it was also a book that topped best-seller lists for more than a year and sold 5 million copies. Just as Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick wrote the film and novel versions of 2001: A Space Odyssey simultaneously, the two versions of the originalCosmos are based on each other. “I like to think,” Sagan explained, “that the pleasures of each will be enhanced by reference to the other.” A Spacetime Odyssey doesn’t have a literary counterpart, but that doesn’t mean it’s not intertextual; the pleasures of the new series will doubtless be enhanced by a whole host of additional materials on the web, including Tyson’s own Twitter screeds.It will also, for some, always exist in relation to its antecedent. It took two passes for me to come to terms with the new Cosmos. But if there’s one thing A Personal Voyage taught viewers, it’s that science is always an unfinished project: a daisy chain of curiosity that spans the ages. Maybe we should think of Cosmos not as a TV show, but as a version of that process, one that each generation gets a pass at. In that case, I think I’m proud of our iteration. It has a foot in the past, but it has the audacity to face forward and jump off the cliff.Like any hypothesis, it might fail if tested, but that’s science.Claire L.

Calling the premiere of a new series a “television event” can sound like hyperbole. In the case of new version Cosmos, though, that language can be justified. Fox had been promoting the series for months, including an ad during what is unarguably a television event, last month’s Super Bowl. The premiere of Cosmos aired last night in an unusual simulcast on ten different networks, from the flagship Fox broadcast network to obscure outposts on the far end of the cable dial like FXX and Fox Sports 2.

And, unlike the typical television series, Cosmos got a send-off from the President of the United States. “America has always been a nation of fearless explorers, who dreamed bigger and reached farther than others imagined,” President Obama said in a 30-second introduction. “That’s the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original Cosmos.”

What he, the show’s producers, and many others hope is that the new Cosmos captures that same spirit of discovery that has, over the years, almost been mythologized. The executives at Fox that greenlighted the show, and spent many millions of dollars, on it also hope it captures views and advertisers. Will it?

A conclusive judgment is impossible until the entire series runs, but last night’s opening episode shows that this new Cosmos has some promise. Host Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist anointed “the next Carl Sagan” long before plans for remaking Cosmos were announced, takes viewers on a whirlwind tour of both space, from the Earth to the edge of the observable universe, and time, compressing the 13.8-billion-year history of the universe into a single year. In between, he tells the story of Giordano Bruno, the 16th century man who first argued we were not at the center of the universe, and for such heresy was burned at the stake.

This Cosmos has elements of both new and old in it. The special effects, as one might imagine, are spectacular, and far beyond what was possible 35 years ago when the original series aired. The iconic ethereal soundtrack of the original series, by Vangelis, has been replaced by a new soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, but it, too, does not overpower. Tyson, like Sagan, travels through space and time in his “Spaceship of the Imagination,” albeit one with a much sleeker design than the dandelion-inspired one Sagan used. Even the cosmic calendar Tyson walked viewers through in the opening episode is borrowed from one Sagan used in the original series.

The one thing jarring about the episode was not the show itself, but the commercial interruptions. The original Cosmos aired on PBS, without commercials, but on Fox, and in prime time, commercials are a necessity. That led to some odd juxtapositions of content: while Tyson hailed the triumph of science over superstition and the promise of a bright future, the commercial breaks included ads for a Biblical epic (Noah) and a movie set in a dystopian future (The Hunger Games.)

Few, though, doubted the quality of the special effects that would be used in the new Cosmos. More people questioned how seriously Fox—a network not known for highbrow entertainment or documentaries—would take a show like Cosmos. The fact that one of its executive producers is Seth MacFarlane, best known for television shows like Family Guy, didn’t increase the confidence of skeptics. And while Tyson had long been compared to Sagan, and had television experience hosting PBS’s Nova ScienceNow, some wondered if he was the right person to host a reboot of the show.

Part of the skepticism stems from his public speaking experience, where Tyson doesn’t exude the calm demeanor of a Sagan. For example, in an on-stage interview Saturday at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Festival in Austin, Texas, ostensibly to promote the series, Tyson jumped from tangent to tangent, excitedly veering off what appeared to be a planned script for the event. “You know, Neil, we’re going to be doing something else,” his interviewer, science journalist Christie Nicholson, said at one point, as Tyson was opining about the lack of ice caps on an inflatable globe during an intended demonstration of the scale of the solar system. (“Don’t get me started on Pluto,” he advised earlier in his SXSW interview, before going off on a tangent about the former ninth planet. “That would derail the whole thing.”)

Tyson has also rubbed some members of the professional astronomical community the wrong way with a perceived emphasis on self-promotion over science. In a plenary talk at an American Astronomical Society (AAS) conference in January outside of Washington, DC, Tyson started with a hopeful message for the audience of professional astronomers and students. “I think science is rising, it is percolating up from fertilized ground, and it is on a level I have not seen before,” he said. “Science, and in particular astrophysics, is in the hearts and minds of the public right now, and it is growing.”

Tyson attempted to prove this by demonstrating how science was becoming a greater part of pop culture, from ComicCon to Internet memes to even tattoos. However, as the talk progressed, many in the audience saw Tyson talking less about science in pop culture and more about Tyson himself, from diving into the statistics of his Twitter followers (currently about 1.7 million) to showing a screenshot of his weekly schedule, packed with meetings and trips.

On the backchannel of Twitter, some attendees expressed displeasure with the tone of Tyson’s talk. “I have to say, I am not seeing much of a message from this talk, except that the speaker thinks he’s awesome,” tweeted Australian astronomer and author Bryan Gaensler in a comment typical of the criticism many in the audience expressed about the talk.

But the Tyson who appears in Cosmos is not the manic or narcissistic character that some might conclude him to be from some of those public appearances. He’s clearly excited about the wonders of the universe that he plans to show viewers, but he does so in a calm, confident way—like Sagan. 

The opening episode about Cosmos, though, is a little bit about Tyson at the end, but in a good way. Many know from Tyson’s previous talks and writings that, as a high school student in the mid-1970s, he traveled by bus from New York City to Ithaca to visit Carl Sagan at Cornell University. He recounts that story at the end of the episode and pulls out a calendar of Sagan’s, with Tyson’s name written in it on the day of his visit. It is an emotional passing of the torch from one generation to the next, from one Cosmos to the next.

Whether this next-generation Cosmos is a success won’t be known until after the series finishes airing—and perhaps for not long after. While Fox will soon be able to judge if the advertising and other revenue from the series made it profitable, the success of the series to further germinate what Tyson described in January was the public’s growing interest in science in general, and space science in particular, may take many years to gauge. It was apt, then, for Tyson to close out the first episode with this advice: “Our journey is just beginning.”

564	"Monday, February 12, 2018 | Updated at  3:23 PM ETAlmost 20 years after the death of Carl Sagan, his popular TV show is being rebooted and has been given a 21st century makeover. The new show has really big shoes to fill but 20th Century Fox hopes that the remake will be just as popular as the original show was on PBS.The show's producers have high hopes for the new series titled Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. Hosted by famous astrophysicist Neal deGrasse Tyson, the new show will air for 13 weeks on Fox at 9 p.m., taking the coveted Sunday night spot often reserved for animated comedies, according to CNN Money.The new show was revived in 2009 when Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy, invited Tyson to lunch. MacFarlane helped Tyson and Ann Druyan, Sagan's widow and the new show's producer and creator, pitch the show to Fox's executives. CNN Money explains that Fox executives Kevin Reilly and Peter Rice ""both liked the idea of doing something that no one had ever done before,"" so MacFarlane's and Druyan's production companies began work on the improved show.""The difference today is not only have visual effects advanced, but because this is airing on a major network, we had the resources -- we had access to people who have told these great dramatic stories on the big screen,"" Tyson explained. The show will keep some aspects of the old series like the Cosmic Calendar but will also feature new things. The show will attempt to bring science back into the mainstream.""Carl made it possible for everyone to feel goose bumps about the grandeur, beauty and romance of life in the cosmos,"" Druyan told the New York Daily News about her husband's work. ""There are many surprises in the new show, and we're going places that Carl and I in the original series never got to go.""With sophisticated special effects and animated segments, the new show aims to make science more accessible. Fox and the show's producers are aiming big with the new show, according to the Daily News, since they will air the new episode simultaneously on multiple channels in the U.S. and in other 171 countries. frank rubio National Hydrocarbons Commission Disney Channel's newest star is adding diversity to the channel and empowering girls her age through her lead role in ""Stuck in the Middle."" immmigrants post Fans are preparing to set a Gunness World Record on July 6 celebrating the artist's birthday.CategoriesCategoriesFollow Us"	Science

567	"LOS ANGELES -- The ""ship of the imagination"" is roaring ahead into its second voyage.""Cosmos,"" the new, updated version of Carl Sagan's popular 1980 documentary series exploring the hows, whats and whys of the universe, premiered Sunday night on Fox, the National Geographic Channel and various corporate cousins.Its ""ship of the imagination"" -- a vehicle to take viewers through wonders large and small -- now has a new captain, astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson, but the reaction to the show's debut shows that entertaining, informative science never goes out of style.""I'll be eagerly tuning in for future episodes,"" wrote the Los Angeles Times' Jennifer Ouellette, praising Tyson as ""affable"" and ""engaging"" and noting the debut episode's lively use of ideas -- such as the ""powers of 10"" -- that could turn to cliché in other hands.""Tonally the show strikes just the right balance between education and inspiration,"" wrote The Verge's Bryan Bishop, though adding that he believed the premiere tried too hard.""It feels like it's missing its own point: that the greatest wonders aren't CG (computer generated) spectacle, but our own marvelous universe,"" he wrote.Science fans -- and fans of the original series -- have been awaiting the new ""Cosmos"" for months. The show has the imprimatur of Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan, and is being produced by ""Family Guy"" mogul Seth MacFarlane, an avowed ""Cosmos"" geek.Through it all, Tyson has maintained his good humor as he's promoted the show.""The universe is hilarious!"" he told GQ in a recent interview. ""Like, Venus is 900 degrees. I could tell you it melts lead. But that's not as fun as saying, 'You can cook a pizza on the windowsill in 9 seconds.' And next time my fans eat pizza, they're thinking of Venus!""Tyson said that one of the ideas behind ""Cosmos"" is to reignite ""that flame of curiosity in us all.""""One of our mission statements in 'Cosmos' is to present science with all of its glory and the majesty and the mystery and the wonder -- the things we all take for granted as children,"" Tyson said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources.""Tyson acknowledged that he's bothered about the debate between science and religion that's became a mainstay of political campaigns and op-ed pages.""There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,"" Tyson told Stelter. ""I find it odd that we live in a time where people who are strongly religious want to make everyone else the same kind of religious way they are, and break down the door of the science classroom to put their religious philosophies in there.""Though there was some tweaking of religion on social media -- ""SPOILER ALERT: apparently the earth is not 6000 years old... Who knew!?"" tweeted JaclynGlenn -- in general, people were impressed.""That was the best commercial for science ever,"" tweeted Dan Treadway.And Wil Wheaton -- who knows a little something about TV, entertainment and science, having been an actor on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"" -- was positively effusive.""Dear everyone involved in making #cosmos: Thank you. Thank you so much. I hope you inspire an entire generation to fall in love with science,"" he tweeted.""Cosmos"" will continue for 12 more episodes.™ & © 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

568	"Reboot of 1980s “Cosmos” Science Series Has Host in Captain Kirk-Like SeatIt is considered unlikely that the next installment of the documentary “Cosmos” called “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” ends up making the same impact that it did 34-years ago under the screen presence and narration of US astronomer Carl Sagan. However, the television program is worthy viewing and informative.The new host of the show is Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson of the American Museum of Natural History’s Hayden Planetarium in New York City. It is evident from Dr.Tyson’s narration that he inflects his voice in a pattern similar to a planetarium presentation which at times came across as overworked.During the show, Dr. Tyson is seen seated in a chair as if to be a type of Captain Kirk with the large viewing screen before him as he guides viewers through the wonders of the universe. The show will run for 13 episodes on the Fox Network during the all-important Sunday night prime time slot.The show marks the culmination of decades of work by the late Carl Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan to bring the show back to primetime. Episode one called “Standing Up in the Milky Way” aired Sunday night and depicted just how small a space we occupy in this vast universe.In one scene, the show flashes back to the year 1600 when the scientist Giordano Bruno is put to death by the Catholic “Holy Inquisition” because he put forth the concept of a broad universe as opposed to an Earth-centric model. The look was a bit cheesy. It airs at the same time as “The Bible” miniseries which may prove to be stiff competition.Cosmos: A Personal Voyage – Episode 4 (Carl Sagan)

The flagship episode of the science series has gotten viral on Twitter. This was after hashtag #COSMOS went trending. Hashtag #COSMOSspoilers also mocked followers on Twitter, reported Los Angeles Times.The excitement from the audience is not a surprise at all. This was after the remake of the orginal Cosmos series had already touched millions of aspiring scientists from way back then. This would include the creator of the hit series Family Guy, Seth MacFarlane.According to a Los Angeles Times review, many of the old Cosmos fans would consider a remake heretical. However, as there aren’t any science series airing on major cable providers, Cosmos provide a relief. The primetime science extravaganza series airs on Fox that showcases the engaging astronomer Niel deGrasse Tyson.Sign up for our Deals of the Day newsletter.We will not spam you!Everything went well, You are now subscribed!

570	"Neil DeGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and star of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, appeared on CNN’s Reliable Sources Sunday to talk about the show and media treatment of science in general. Tyson spoke of the innate hypocrisy of people rejecting modern science while embracing the very best of scientific discovery “that we so take for granted today,” and without it, “we will just regress back into the cave.”Stelter referenced his own recent commentary about how the media should not be giving equal time to anti-science views, and asked Tyson what he believes the media’s responsibility on this issue should be. Tyson said the media shouldn’t be in the business of giving “equal time to the flat-earthers.”“Science is not there for you to cherry-pick. You know, I said this once and it’s gotten a lot of Internet play, I said the good thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it. All right? I guess you can decide whether or not to believe in it, but that doesn’t change the reality of an emergent scientific truth.”Stelter also asked about how Cosmos, a scientific show, will keep viewers entertained. Tyson replied, “The very nature of that question presumes that real science and real entertainment cannot be the same thing unless one compromises to the other.”Watch the video below, via CNN:[h/t HuffPost][photo via screengrab]— —Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniacHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.comHave a tip or story idea?

571	"In 1980, Carl Sagan opened his series Cosmos with these words, capturing both the immensity and intimacy of the universe.  Now, thirty four years later, Neil DeGrasse Tyson stands on the same seaside promontory Sagan used to open his program to introduce Cosmos to a new generation.The Ship of the ImaginationFor his series, Sagan created the Ship of the Imagination, a dandelion seed-like snowflake of light and perception which could travel the cosmos unfettered by the limitations of space and time. Tyson's newly christened Ship of the Imagination is a slick, environment mapped craft reminiscent of Boba Fett's which travels not only through the billions of light years of our visible universe, but also across the decades of advancement in telescopy, filmmaking and visual effects. His Cosmos appears more polished, more richly detailed, but also more familiar to the generation raised on images from the Hubble.And where Sagan began his voyage out in deep space and slowly made his way toward the inner solar system, Tyson begins his journey here, on Earth, and uses the Ship to establish our cosmic address: Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, Local Group, The Universe.Your God is Too SmallSagan and Tyson both follow the Ship of the Imagination with stories of men who helped bring scientific thought to the world. These stories establish the importance of science to humanity and represent the greatest contrast between today's Cosmos and the Cosmos of yesteryear.AdvertisementSagan choose for his subject the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, who correctly calculated the curvature of the Earth by comparing noonday shadow measurements taken at different latitudes and follows with a paen for the lost Library of Alexandria. Tyson's subject, told in animation, is the story of Giordano Bruno, the sixteenth century monk who challenged church teaching on the centrality of the Earth and the infinite nature of the universe.Sagan, worried about the nuclear arms race and the potential for humanity to destroy ourselves, warned us of the fragility of knowledge and what we can all lose if we're too careless with fire. Tyson, on the other hand, warns us of the danger of living in a world where questioning official stories becomes heresy, where curiosity becomes thought crime and where exploration of the universe becomes a trespass into the dominion of authority.In Tyson's Cosmos, Bruno speaks to his fellow believers and tells them that if they cannot accept a universe where the stars are truly suns, where Earth is but one of many planets and where the scope of creation extends into infinity because these ideas violate their sense of God, then it is their sense of God that is too small. AdvertisementBut there is a danger is making a God that is too big as well. A theory of anything is a theory of nothing, and there is just as much harmful dogma in giving equal time to geocentrists and flat Earthers as there is in forbidding ideas that contradict a holy book. ""We will speculate,"" said Sagan in his introduction, ""but we will always remember that there is a difference between speculation and fact."" At a time when our leaders openly characterize science as ""just another worldview"" and suggest that it's simply not fair that myths and hunches should not be given an equal place at the table as theories and data, this restatement of the purpose of science is more than a little bit welcome.The Cosmic CalendarThe final element in both Sagan's and Tyson's first episode is the Cosmic Calendar, which presents the entire history of the cosmos compressed into a single year. Having placed our home world in its spatial context and our epoch in historical context, the Cosmic Calendar places our entire existence in its temporal context: if the universe was one year old, civilization would be less than ten seconds old. Everything we've ever heard of, every battle, every king, every empire, every invention, every tragedy and every triumph exists in those scant few final seconds of the Cosmic Year.AdvertisementSagan ends his premiere episode with a slightly metaphor-breaking question about how our civilization will face the first seconds of the next cosmic year and whether we will have the wisdom to avoid destroying ourselves and prove ourselves worthy inheritors of the vast cosmos we inhabit.Tyson answers this question by bringing the story back to Carl Sagan himself, recalling the contributions he made not only to cosmology and planetary science, but also to Tyson's own life as well as our own. On a different, more humble calendar, Tyson shows us a meeting Carl Sagan had scheduled on December 20th 1975 with a 17 year old kid from the Bronx named...Neil DeGrasse Tyson. AdvertisementIn her introduction to the 2005 re-issue of the original series, Ann Druyan described Cosmos as ""both a history of the scientific enterprise and an attempt to convey the soaring spiritual high of its central revelation: our oneness with the universe.""In tying Sagan's personal voyage back to his own, Tyson not only elevates Sagan to the pantheon of scientific visionaries like Bruno, Eratosthenes, Kepler, Galileo and the others who struggled to light a candle and banish the darkness of the demon haunted world, but he reminds us that the value of science must be told and retold to each subsequent generation. Whether we're confronting the scientific ""hostage situation"" created by Cold War hegemony or filtering the deluge of dubious information that the current generation absorbs on a daily basis, science is the corrective lens that helps us see more clearly that our faults lie, as ever, not in our stars, but in ourselves.Cosmos airs each Sunday night at 9:00 on Fox TV.AdvertisementJason Shankel is a writer and creative developer who is made of star stuff."

572	"Cosmos: A Spacetime OdysseyTodd Leopold, (CNN) — The “ship of the imagination” is roaring ahead into its second voyage.“Cosmos,” the new, updated version of Carl Sagan’s popular 1980 documentary series exploring the hows, whats and whys of the universe, premiered Sunday night on FOX43, the National Geographic Channel and various corporate cousins.Its “ship of the imagination” — a vehicle to take viewers through wonders large and small — now has a new captain, astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson, but the reaction to the show’s debut shows that entertaining, informative science never goes out of style.“I’ll be eagerly tuning in for future episodes,” wrote the Los Angeles Times’ Jennifer Ouellette, praising Tyson as “affable” and “engaging” and noting the debut episode’s lively use of ideas — such as the “powers of 10” — that could turn to cliché in other hands.“Tonally the show strikes just the right balance between education and inspiration,” wrote The Verge’s Bryan Bishop, though adding that he believed the premiere tried too hard.“It feels like it’s missing its own point: that the greatest wonders aren’t CG (computer generated) spectacle, but our own marvelous universe,” he wrote.COSMOS: A SPACETIME ODYSSEYScience fans — and fans of the original series — have been awaiting the new “Cosmos” for months.

573	The roof-raising finale of True Detective will justifiably dominate discussion of the weekend’s television (I’m never going to look at flowers or dolls quite the same way), but last night also saw the premiere of the new Cosmos. I loved the original series, so I approached Sunday’s premiere with as much trepidation as anything else. The idiosyncratic charms of Carl Sagan’s series — the Ship of the Imagination, the turtlenecks, the need to invent the universe before apple pie — are pretty much impossible to replicate, so was this gonna be any good? Happily, the answer — so far, at least — is “yes.”Part of the charm of Sagan’s Cosmos was its earnest confidence in both its host’s ability to explain and its audience’s willingness to understand. The show assumed that people really did want to know why there were crabs that looked like samurai, or whether there might be more than three dimensions, and that the subject matter was compelling enough that it didn’t need any jazzing up. It’s striking to compare it to later shows like How the Universe Works, where the story of the universe is structured as a narrative, with hilarious cliffhangers and a dramatic voiceover.Cosmos was never like that — its narrative leaped from the dawn of time to the present to the future and back again, following its creator’s train of thought and his whims. It was presented as “a personal voyage,” and it was — one that could only have been undertaken by the man who took it. Sensibly, host Neil deGrasse Tyson and the new show’s creators don’t attempt to replicate this idea. Instead, this is billed as “a spacetime odyssey,” and Tyson’s style of presentation tends more toward the conventional narration of, say, David Attenborough than Sagan.Still, Tyson is very much part of the show, and you get the feeling that this series will be as identified with him as the original was with Sagan. At the end of this premiere, he speaks fondly and movingly of the time he met Sagan as a teenager — the two spent a day together, an experience that Tyson suggests was just as formative in shaping his personality as in making him want to become a scientist — and there’s a real sense of a baton being passed here, with Tyson taking up the work of his predecessor and bringing popular science to the world. (He also shares Sagan’s penchants for moments of flair, amusingly donning a pair of sunglasses before bearing witness to a recreation of the Big Bang.)It’s a tricky balance to strike, paying homage to what’s gone before while steering clear of being a complete pastiche. On the strength of the premiere, at least, the new Cosmos manages to get it right. There are elements that’ll be familiar to fans of the original show — the Ship of the Imagination, the Cosmic Calendar — but also new ideas, like the animated sections that relate the story of ill-fated 16th-century visionary Giordano Bruno, who was one of the first to propose the idea that the sun was just one of many stars, and was burned at the stake by the Catholic Church for his trouble.The animations will divide fans, I suspect, but there’s a certain charm to them, especially as a counterpoint to the big-budget CGI of the new Ship of the Imagination. They’re the sort of thing that Sagan might have liked, you suspect — a method of relating a story that makes it popularly accessible without dumbing down or trivializing the subject. It’s this balance between storytelling and education that the original Cosmos struck so well, and while the first episode isn’t a huge amount of evidence to judge on, the new Cosmos seems to do this well.Popular science is a field that’s difficult to get right, but hugely rewarding if you do so. As Sagan’s widow Ann Druyan, who co-wrote the original series with her husband, says here: “Both series combine rigorous scientific skepticism with a soaring sense of the romance of life in the cosmos.” That’s an admirable goal, and one that all popular science should aspire to.Science shouldn’t be dry — it’s eternally fascinating, especially when you’re dealing with headline topics like the origin of the universe and the birth of stars — but neither should it need to be tarted up for the masses. Like the original Cosmos, Tyson’s series talks to the viewer as an equal, and invites them to come on a fascinating journey. It’s one that we’ll enjoy taking, I think.@2016 Flavorpill Media.

574	"Fans are upset that the show didn't use the comic book version of the creation of the universe.	Last night, Fox aired the long awaited premiere of Cosmos, a remake of the 1980 Carl Sagan show.  Produced by Seth Macfarlane and narrated by popular astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the series debuted to both critical acclaim, fan hype and high ratings.  However, not everyone is happy with the way the series depicted the birth of the universe.  	A group of rigidly inflexible extremists are speaking out against the show for what they feel is an inaccurate depiction of the Big Bang, citing a dated piece of literature as proof.  ""I was really excited to see how Cosmos showed the creation of the universe,"" said Geoffrey Graver, a 51 year old analyst from Portland Oregon. ""Imagine my disappointment when they didn't show a giant cosmic hand grabbing a spiral galaxy in the center of a astronomical maelstrom."" 	Graver and several others are upset that Cosmos didn't use DC's Crisis on Infinite Earths' theory of the multiverse, which states that an Oan scientist named Krona created the multiverse when he attempted to view the beginning of the universe, causing all sorts of weird shit to go down.  ""With all of Tyson's talk of the multiverse and the Big Bang, you'd think he'd have the good grace to acknowledge that it all came about when an alien tried to glimpse at forbidden knowledge,"" Graver said.  He went on to express his displeasure that the show also didn't reference the Source Wall or the Fourth World, both key components in DC's universal theory. 	Graver stated that he's spoken to dozens of like-minded fans and have even gone as far as to petition the US government to force Cosmos to reference the DC theory of creation, citing that viewers would have an otherwise be presented with an incomplete set of universal creation theories. ""It's not that I don't mind Cosmos discussing other theories about the creation of the universe,"" Graver said.  ""It's just that I want them to talk about the correct one as well. You know, the one that involves a giant hand squeezing a galaxy like a melon.""	The Outhouse reached out to deGrasse Tyson for comment, but he was busy with speaking to real websites, so we turned to the only other scientist we know for his opinion on Graver's complaints. ""It's true,"" said Thaddeus T. Puffinbottoms, professor of Bullshit Astrophysical Theories at the prestigious DeVry University.  ""Cosmos didn't references giant cosmic hands, Thetans, Cthulhu, or conflicting creation stories found in the same chapter of Genesis.  If you were looking for fanciful, but totally legitimate, theories on how the universe was created, you'd be disappointed.""  	Graver isn't the only person upset with Cosmos.  ""I watched Cosmos just so I could bitch about  The Big Bang Theory on Facebook and write fifteen articles about it on my website,"" said Gus Sterlingham, a self-proclaimed know it all and journalist.  ""So imagine my surprise when Sheldon Cooper, Penny No Last Name, or Leonard Hofstadter didn't make appearances on the show.  How am I supposed to whine about a television show if they don't put things in there that I don't like?"" 	National Geographic will air an encore of the controversial episode tonight, featuring new material.  New episodes will air on Sundays.  	 No comments.Login to comment or register for a FREE Outhouse Account.

The show featured an introduction by President Barack Obama and on Twitter, NASA let viewers explore some of the featured moments in the episode, from Hubble images to the exploration of planets and interstellar space.The first episode, “Standing Up in the Milky Way,” focused on our galaxy, and NASA has played a big role in its exploration. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has big shoes to fill, following in the footsteps of the late Carl Sagan, who created and hosted the original show in 1980, but his personality and sense of humor has already earned him plenty of fans. Much like Sagan, Tyson makes science accessible and fun while reveling in the beauty of scientific exploration.Early ratings are in for ""Cosmos,"" and it appears to be a hit. Full numbers will not be available until later on Monday but the Fox premiere averaged 5.8 million viewers, notes the Hollywood Reporter. The premiere of “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” featured many of NASA’s missions, and the space agency kept the conversation going by giving viewers an in-depth look at some of the coolest moments. The return of “Cosmos” also featured the return of the Cosmic Calendar, which condenses the 13.8 billion year existence of the universe into one calendar year.    Hubble captures the ""Mystic Mountain"" of the Carina Nebula. Photo: NASA, ESA, and M. Livio and the Hubble 20th Anniversary Team  “Cosmos” featured a high-definition image of Earth that was taken by NASA’s Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite (Suomi NPP), while images from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbit (LRO) satellite, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission and Hubble were also featured.As for planetary exploration, the Cassini mission is observing Saturn and Curiosity and Opportunity are exploring Mars while coming missions to Jupiter and Pluto were highlighted in “Cosmos.”Of course, exploring the Milky Way would not be complete without mentioning some of the most amazing achievements by NASA and joint ventures like the Hubble Space Telescope. Voyager 1, launched on Sept. 5, 1977, has reached interstellar space and is the first man-made object to go beyond our solar system. Its twin, Voyager 2, is right behind Voyager 1 and should reach interstellar space in a couple of years. Hubble was also able to spot what could be the oldest known star, HD 140283.The two Voyager spacecraft are performing well, and Voyager 1 is carrying a golden record containing special messages from Earth. The instructions, images and greetings were selected by a committee chaired by none other than Sagan.A full gallery of NASA images featured in, or inspired by, ""Cosmos"" can be viewed here.

577	"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Astronomer Carl Sagan become Mr. Science for a generation after his 1980 series, “Cosmos,” took audiences on a groundbreaking TV journey through the universe.Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,” the 21st-century edition debuting Sunday, has a head start with a Twitter following of 1.7 million that’s just edged by the starry likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Cee Lo Green.Tyson, a go-to expert for news reports on Earth-threatening asteroids and other science developments, said his public profile frees him from comparisons to Sagan. The educator and author with a gift for conveying the wonder of discovery died in 1996 at age 62.“If I didn’t have a following, I think people would say, ‘How is he going to fill Carl Sagan’s shoes? How is he going to pronounce billion?'” said Tyson, referring to the “billions and billions of stars” phrase made famous by Sagan in “Cosmos” (although purists insist Sagan said “upon,” not “and”).Sagan was the presenter for the first series, Tyson said, and he’s the presenter for the second. He gamely accepts an analogy, one he’s clearly heard before, to the string of actors who have starred in the “Doctor Who” title role.Each contributes something different, but “you’re still with the franchise at the end of the day,” he said.The new version begins its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.Tyson, 55, brings to the program his distinguished credentials as director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an author whose works include “Space Chronicles” and “The Pluto Files.”He’s the perfect modern media scientist: tall and good-looking, with a deep voice that he uses to charismatic and authoritative effect.Proving he’s a stickler for accuracy, Tyson took “Gravity” to task for scientific gaffes and prompted a flurry of coverage ranging from Hollywood trade papers to geek-favored websites. Among the more lighthearted of his “Mysteries of #Gravity” tweets: “Why Bullock’s hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.”He is also one of the nation’s most prominent African-American scientists, but says ethnicity isn’t in the forefront of his perspective.“I’ve never divided my audience that way. My audience is, are you curious about the universe or not?” Tyson said. The father of two also rejects the idea of inspiring anyone to follow his career path because he is black.“I don’t go around saying I’m going to be somebody’s role model. In fact, I think the concept of ‘role model’ is overrated and should be rethought,” he said. His argument: If it had taken a black astrophysicist to have been raised in Bronx, N.Y., as Tyson was, for him to become one, it wouldn’t have happened.“Role models limit what it is you might want to be when you grow up, because you’re only allowed to do what others have done who have come before you,” Tyson said. “And no one should ever be limited in their imagination.”His involvement in “Cosmos” brings him to a different and bigger stage. It gives him the chance to increase his profile with a new crowd, including the viewers who tune in to Fox for “Family Guy” laughs in the half-hour preceding “Cosmos” on Sunday and suddenly find themselves lost in space.It was Seth MacFarlane, the comic mind behind “Family Guy” and other projects including Fox’s “American Dad!” and the movie “Ted,” who got the network involved in the project. MacFarlane, a fan of the original “Cosmos,” also turns out to be a Tyson admirer. The two met through a group that connects people in science and entertainment for the exchange of ideas.MacFarlane told reporters in January that he “wanted to sit down and ask him (Tyson) a whole bunch of nerd questions, and so I asked if he wanted to have lunch, and astonishingly he said ‘yes.'”They became collaborators on “Cosmos,” with MacFarlane an executive producer. The project has the look of a costly sci-fi film, reflecting what Tyson called a budget “commensurate” with its scope as well as the participation of top entertainment industry talent such as Bill Pope, director of photography on “Matrix” and “Spider-Man” movies.Patrick Stewart, Richard Gere, Kirsten Dunst and other actors give voice to the scientists whose achievements are part of “Cosmos.”Adding to its pedigree: Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, who wrote the original series with Sagan and Steven Soter and who joined again with Soter to craft the second.She’s also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.“Yes, it’s the same in that intersection of emotion and solid science and fabulous facts and animation and drama and history,” she told a news conference. “But it’s completely new.”For Tyson, the series is a means to connect viewers to the “awe and wonder” of the universe and the role of science in helping them “become a better shepherd of this world.”“We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address,” he said.___Lynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

578	"Fox By Matt Juul, Boston.com CorrespondentFoxBy Matt Juul, Boston.com CorrespondentWhen shows about ancient aliens and searching for Bigfoot dominate networks like Discovery and the History Channel, it's refreshing to see actual scientific programming hit the airwaves -- especially on a major player like Fox. ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" -- a reboot of the late Carl Sagan's 1980 PBS series -- debuted Sunday night, across a bevy of Fox networks, bringing the many wonders of the universe to primetime audiences.Produced by ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane and hosted by famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the 13-episode series debuted with a bang -- Big Bang-style.
Using an amalgam of CGI effects and actual space footage, Tyson gave viewers a concise yet thorough break down of the history of the universe, as well as how we came to understand our place in it.While the stylized animation is a notable upgrade from Sagan's ""Cosmos,"" having Tyson as the host also gave the show an element of gravitas and wit that educational series typically lack. From reminding viewers Pluto isn't a planet to calling out the dogmatic ways of organized religions, Tyson delivered the cold, hard facts without an hint of condescension -- think: a science-loving Morgan Freeman.Going up against heavyweight programming, including AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" and the finale of HBO's ""True Detective,"" ""Cosmos"" was able to make a splash on social media, showing that with the right production, science can be cool in 2014.I am so into @COSMOSonTV I hope it never endsWow. Just shared with my son what made me love science when I was a kid. He said ""don't erase it!"" Thank you! RT @COSMOSonTV #CosmosPremierethere is so much science on my timeline right now. this makes me quite happy. thank you @neiltyson. thank you @COSMOSonTV. #WatchingCosmos""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" airs Sundays on Fox at 9 pm and will be rebroadcast on National Geographic on Mondays at 10 pm.

580	"“What leaders really do: They don’t make plans; they don’t solve problems; they don’t even o…Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson debuted Sunday on Fox, and with its riveting visuals and compelling narrative, it was everything fans of the original series could have hoped from a reboot.Carl Sagan’s original series, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, was first broadcast in 1980 and remains the most globally successful American public television series of all time. Seen by more than 750 million viewers, Cosmos has remained popular throughout the world. When Sagan died in 1996 at 62, his legacy was as infinite as the show’s opening line: “The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.”And as with the legendary original series, the new Cosmos tells the saga of how we discovered the laws of nature and found our coordinates in space and time. Some elements of the original series have been retained: the Ship of the Imagination (transporting viewers through space and time) and the Cosmic Calendar (compressing 13.8 billion years into a single year-at-a-glance, where humans arrive only in the last few seconds). But the adventure has been updated with dazzling special effects, from the heart of an atom to the promise of deep space, including a look at a day on the beach on Venus, before that planet became an infernal cauldron. And heroic stories of scientific exploration are told using animation by a team selected by Seth MacFarlane (a Cosmos executive producer and science enthusiast), who created the Fox series Family Guy and American Dad!The opener indeed paid homage to Sagan’s legacy (the first episode began with the words of Sagan himself) and Dr. Tyson clearly shares the same love of science. The visuals are out of this world, and Tyson is seen seated in a chair, Captain Kirk-style, with the large viewing screen in front of him as he takes viewers on a journey through the universe.“Cosmos is not only about updating you on what science is but also conveying why it matters—especially in the 21st century, when issues related to science are fundamental to political issues,” Tyson tells Parade. “There are political hot potatoes that could be settled or informed if we became more scientifically literate.”What did viewers think of the reboot? Take a look at some fan (and a few celeb) tweets!Watched the #CosmosPremiere on Fox and now watching it again on Nat Geo because it's just so good.— Erick Gomez (@erickgomez) March 10, 2014I am so into @COSMOSonTV I hope it never ends— Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) March 10, 2014.@cosmosontv #Cosmos is cool.

583	"Can we take a day off from Ukraine and CPAC and missing airliners to celebrate something very special? It's the need for most of us to want to learn new things; and for being blessed by having a few people who know about those things and, more important, know how to explain them to the rest of us. A re-booted version of the fabulously successful 80s program about space, ""Cosmos; A Personal Journey,"" which was hosted by the late Dr. Carl Sagan (pronounced SAY-gun) premiered jointly last night on all 10 20th Century Fox networks including the National Geographic Channel, FX, and Fox (the one that features the NFL). The original ""Cosmos"" (which was the most popular program in the history of PBS) gave us the phrase ""star stuff"" as in, ""We're all made of star stuff."" Dr. Sagan's odd speech pattern also gave us a new way to talk about the Federal budget back then when he leaned hard on the ""b"" in ""Billions and Billions (although Sagan said the actual phrase was ""Billions upon Billions."" ""Cosmos"" used the highest production values available in its time for Sagan to give us a new way of thinking about our world and our universe. Sagan might not have been the best astronomer in his day, but he was certainly the best known. And he was no charlatan. He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Cornell University until he died of bone cancer in 1996 at the age of 62. Sagan is one of my scientific heroes; second only to physicist Richard Feynman (pronounced ""FINE-man"") winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. Dr. Feynman did a series of seven lectures, with exactly zero production values, also at Cornell University. I watched all seven about a year ago and it was one of those deals where, as I was watching, I understood what Feynman was saying, but as soon as the lecture was over I said to myself, ""What was that again?"" One of my favorite Feynman stories - and I think I actually read this somewhere because I don't think I'm clever enough to have made it up - is about the time when, during the Q & A section of a lecture, he was asked if he thought we would ever invent an anti-gravity machine. As I remember the story, Feynman said: ""Let's define what you mean. I assume you mean a machine that will lift you off the surface of the earth to a predetermined height; leave you there for a period of time of your choosing; then deliver you back to the surface unharmed."" The student agreed with that definition ""We already have that. It's called an elevator. Next question."" Both Feynman and Sagan had the gift of being able to explain complex scientific principals so even someone like me - who, as you know, is so mathematically challenged that all last year I thought I was 67 only to find out just prior to my birthday that I had been only 66 all that year. The new version of ""Cosmos"" is hosted by a man who stands tall alongside Sagan and Feynman, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson. Dr. Tyson is the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. You've seen Dr. Tyson a million times, doing exactly what Sagan and Feynman did before him: Explain how we came to be and where we might be going in words and pictures that we can not just understand, but appreciate. I am not going to draw grand conclusions about how, by better understanding the unfathomable scale of the cosmos we, should recognize how really small we are, but it does remind me of that great line delivered by Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"" ""I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" Thanks to Feynman, Sagan and now Tyson for being great scientists and great teachers.Latest: Vanessa Trump Sent to Hospital After Opening Letter With Suspicious SubstanceA Few of the Most Controversial Parts of Trump's New Budget

Quick question: When was the last time a television series dedicated purely to science premiered on a major network during primetime? The fact that barely anyone can remember the answer was but one reason to tune into FOX last night for the premiere of ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey."" The 13-part series, a follow-up to the 1980 original with Carl Sagan, has been exhaustively covered by the media in anticipation of its return. Last night, we were finally able to see if the wait was worth it. And wow — it really did start with a bang. 

While I encourage you to watch the entire first episode online here, below are some of the more amazing highlights. 

I. President Barack Obama's opening introduction

When the president of the United States is the one opening up your series premiere, you know what's coming is not only something special, but also valuable to the overall education of the country. President Obama did that last night with a perfectly succinct opening, expressing his love of the original ""Cosmos"" and hoping that the latest reboot inspires a new generation of Americans to look up and dream. 

“America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dream big and reach farther than others imagine,” he said. Check it out below. 



If you know of Neil deGrasse Tyson, seeing him as the host of ""Cosmos"" last night wasn't much of a surprise. For millions more, however, Tyson is an unknown. Last night changed all that, with the 55-year-old displaying his talent for making such heavy topics not only accessible, but fun and awe-inspiring. And while some public speakers often find the jump to television a bit intimidating, Tyson pulled it off with ease — especially when you consider that most of the time, he was on a giant green screen set with very little to work off of.



III. That amazing Cosmic Calendar 

While Carl Sagan premiered a similar ""cosmic calendar"" back in 1980, the one on display last night was really incredible. I've no doubt this part of ""Cosmos"" will be replayed countless times in science classes around the world for decades to come. The calendar, represented by our 12-month calendar, covers 13.8 billion years — with 438 years per second, 1.58 million years per hour, and 37.8 million years per day.

If you want to feel really small, consider this: Using this scale, humanity only arrived on the scene less than an hour ago. 



Of all the computer simulations last night of our solar system, I thought the view from within Jupiter's Great Red Spot was the coolest. We've all seen the massive storm, spanning more than the size of three Earths from above, but to be in it looking out was something else entirely. 



V. The Carl Sagan shout-out

In what was a beautiful tribute, I enjoyed how the producers took a break from the science last night to honor the late, great Sagan. In addition to recognizing his substantial efforts to bringing science to the forefront of American culture, Tyson also shared a personal moment — a meeting between the two back in 1975 that forever changed his life. 

""I already knew that I wanted to become a scientist,"" recalls Tyson. ""But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become.""

585	"It has been more than 30 years since the late, great Carl Sagan took to the airwaves to talk about how our future as a species depends powerfully on our understanding of the cosmos, which we float in like a mote of dust. The original Cosmos debuted in 1980 and inspired a generation of scientists and science nerds alike. Now the series is back with Neil deGrasse Tyson at the helm, and Fox has released a new companion app for Android that can help you explore the majesty and unbelievable scale of the cosmos while watching the show.   The app itself contains expanded information, trailers, galleries, and other tidbits from each episode. It looks like new sections unlock as new episodes air, so there's just one to go through now. There are also some moderately annoying ad tie-ins – check out this awesome image of the sun... presented by Jeep. The app is only showing as compatible with phones right now, but the screens have tablet frames. Presumably this is a mistake that will be rectified soon.  You can't watch full episodes in the cosmos app, but they will be in the Fox Now streaming app soon for free, assuming you have a compatible cable subscription (yes, it's lame). The legacy of Cosmos has lasted all these years, and now we have the chance to dive in again with updated science, better visuals, and apps. This isn't the most full-featured companion app I've ever seen, but it's a start. FYI, for those who also cut the cord, Hulu seems to have full episodes for free.Excellent news, thank you for the heads up!Seriously, I shouldn't need a cable subscription to watch something on my phone that I can watch on TV for free.As much as this show is about visuals, I worry about the quality Hulu can deliver.There's the ever-present choice to weigh anchor. Quality is the reason I don't ever use Hulu, but so far it's the only place I've found it streaming free.The real question is whether the FOX NOW app has better quality than Hulu. They are probably going to be equivalent.I expect them to be equally horrible.Does it Chromecast?No, but Hulu Plus does just fine. I'll be watching tonight after work.Its on Hulu+? Cool. I'll be looking for it. Thanks Derek.Looks like their fix for no tablet compatibility was to change the images to a Galaxy S4 instead of a tablet. Hooray.its US ONLY if your in another countryI might be mistaken, but isn't the show ""US Only"" anyway? So wouldn't it make sense that a TV show that is aired only in the US, has a companion app that is available only in the US? Otherwise, you'd be getting a minuscule portion of the entire experience (assuming my first question is true).this isn't a US only show. Its going to played world wide on Nat Geo.It's airing in 181 countries...it aint us only !Ok. Got it. Got it from the first 2 responses. Thank you.

While there's a good chance you'll find someone here who has a computer hooked up to their TV so they can watch the streaming videos on Fox.com in their living room, once you leave the nerd-dom you'll be hard pressed to find someone. Most people are willing to pay a few bucks to have access anywhere they go, with a full HD picture, but it's just not as convenient to watch on your computer, so most people won't....so that's where they give you access just so they can say ""...but we let you use it for free on your computer!!!""Is it ironic that the Fox Now app is available on all my devices except my Google TV?Does the app really need a constantly running service.Could anyone upload the apk? (For the sake of science outside the US) When will these cable networks realize there's far more money to be made by offering a $5 monthly subscription fee for access to the streaming app without a cable subscription?? Sure, still offer free access to those who do have cable, but just give us an option to subscribe to the app without cable!! They would even be able to offer streaming to foreign customers, then, as well. I'll never understand why they work the way they do...it makes absolutely no sense to have it be exclusive and limit the viewers. Call me crazy, but I'd want to reach the most amount of people I could if I were in their shoes.Or they could just be like CBS and just give everyone free access, across the board ;)Fox isn't even a cable network. I pulled in Cosmos from Fox via antenna which was then recorded as a nice HD copy on my HDD. It amazes me that they require people to subscribe to cable to get access to an ad supported streaming version when they freely broadcast it through the air to devices (HTPC, Tivo, others) that can easily skip the commercials.Do you use a notification mirroring service?View Results Discuss This Poll"	Science
586	As if the revival of Carl Sagan's Cosmos couldn't get any more grandiose, tonight's debut has a pretty special guest.

Fox/Cosmos


  In Sunday's premiere of Cosmos, Neil deGrasse Tyson spent a good
  third of the show describing the sheer immensity of time on the
  cosmic scale. Our universe was born 13.8 billion years ago. If we
  condense that time down to one calendar year, we create what is
  called the ""cosmic calendar.""

  In this cosmic calendar 1 day = 40 million years and 1 month =
  more than 1 billion years. 



Fox/Cosmos


  If the big bang happened at the beginning of the year, the first
  second of January 1, then:

  As it expanded, the universe cooled, and it was darkness for
  about 200 million years. Gravity was pulling together clumps of
  gas and heating them until the first stars burst into light on
  January 10. On January 13th, these stars coalesced to form the
  first small galaxies. These galaxies merged to form still larger
  ones, including our own Milky Way. We formed about 11 billion
  years ago, on March 15 of the cosmic year. 

  It took until September for the solar system to develop, and
  early earth to be created. Life starts about that time too.

  In this scale, humans didn't arise until the last day of the
  year, and modern civilization makes up about the last 14 seconds
  of the year. Everyone we have ever heard of lived in those 14
  seconds, deGrasse Tyson says:

  Every person you've ever heard of lies right in there.
  All those
  kings and battles, migrations and inventions, wars and loves,
  every thing in the history books happened here in the last
  seconds of the cosmic calendar.

589	Neil deGrasse Tyson and Seth MacFarlane got a pretty solid endorsement for their new science programPresident Obama led into the first episode of the new reboot of “Cosmos” with a message encouraging the American people to open their eyes and imaginations to the possibilities of the unknown.It was a nice trade:  Obama got some uninterrupted face time with a national TV audience and an opportunity to boost his administration’s emphasis on science and math; Neil deGrasse Tyson and Seth MacFarlane, meanwhile, netted an endorsement for their reboot of the beloved Carl Sagan series that is way more important than anything a TV critic can offer.Also read: Watch: Fox’s Live ‘Cosmos’ Q&A With Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Seth MacFarlane (Video)This was actually a pretty natural fit; during the 2012 election, Obama repeatedly emphasized his commitment to expanding math and science education, and announced a new program that would fund a growing corps of elite math and science teachers.And, of course, Obama has palled around with Tyson, a famed astronomer and “Gravity” spoiler, before.

590	"Science geeks whipped themselves into a veritable frenzy of anticipation over the weekend for the premiere of ""Cosmos,"" the much-touted reboot of the classic series created by astronomer Carl Sagan in the 1970s.You have to understand: Sagan and his original series touched the hearts of millions of people over the years, inspiring new generations of budding young scientists– not to mention ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane, who championed this project from the start. Small wonder the excitement was so palpable; it even inspired a mocking Twitter hashtag, #COSMOSspoilers. (My personal favorite: “Special effects fail during show, so deGrasse Tyson MacGyvers a new universe together to use with Cheetos and silly string.” -- @DrSkySkull)No doubt there are purists among the die-hard Sagan fans who consider any reboot a heretical act. I’m not one of them. There’s precious little real science on TV anymore, certainly not on the major network channels, so it’s gratifying to see Fox pull out all the stops and give us a big-budget, prime-time science extravaganza with eye-popping graphics and the odd whimsical animation, spearheaded by the affable, engaging astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson.BEST TV OF 2013 Lloyd | McNamaraThe first segment of the episode covers pretty familiar ground. It's the old ""Powers of 10"" trope, a staple of science museums, taking the viewer on a tour through the various size scales of the universe: from Earth, to the solar system, to the Milky Way galaxy, to the super-Virgo cluster and beyond, to the outermost reaches of what we can directly observe. But hey – it's a popular trope for a reason, and who am I to deny a whole new audience its first taste of shock and awe at the vast expanse of the cosmos?And Tyson adds a 21st century twist by invoking the multiverse: the notion that our universe might be just a bubble among bubbles in a vast infinite sea of universes. That's the kind of notion that used to fall firmly into crackpot territory – or make for bestselling science fiction novels -- but is now taken quite seriously by many cosmologists, even if it's not (yet, if ever) a testable hypothesis.  And it's the perfect set-up to a charming animated sequence relating one of my favorite stories from the history of astronomy.Giordano Bruno was an Italian mystic who was among the first to adopt the Copernican cosmology at a time when doing so could prove hazardous to your health. In fact, he went one step further and suggested – based on a vision when he was 30, perhaps because he read the forbidden text of Lucretius, ""On The Nature of Things"" – that the sun and its planets were just one of millions of other solar systems in an infinite universe. It made sense to Bruno. God was infinite, he reasoned, so why shouldn’t the universe he created be infinite too?PHOTOS: TV shows and their spinoffsThe Catholic Church begged to differ and excommunicated him. So did the Protestant church. In fact, Bruno was hard-pressed to find any sympathetic ear for his message, and we are treated to many scenes of poor Cartoon Bruno being cast out, shivering, into the cold cruel wilderness. But would he keep his mouth shut? No, he would not. Bruno was a True Believer. He was also a bit of a hothead, with a long history of becoming embroiled in disputes wherever he went. In short, Bruno was not a people person. That and his stubborn refusal to recant his weird beliefs eventually got him imprisoned, tortured and burned at the stake.But as Tyson points out, the dude was right. Sure, it was a lucky guess, and he wasn't really a scientist, but ""It gave others a target to aim at, if only to disprove it."" And just 10 years later, Galileo looked through his telescope and saw the moons of Jupiter, and our view of the universe would never be the same.The Bruno sequence was hands down my favorite part of the episode, a fresh take on what was, to me, a familiar story. Now I want to see an entire animated series that just tells stories of famous scientists throughout the ages, with all the accompanying melodrama and gory details. I‘m thinking an edgy, ""Family Guy"" kind of vibe would be just the thing. Get on that, Seth MacFarlane. Or give us more of these in future episodes. Thanks.The next sequence brushes off yet another time-honored trope of science outreach: how to convey not just the vast size of the universe but also its age, spanning 13.7 billion years? Easy –  you just scale the entire history of the universe down [to one calendar year, with January 1 marking the Big Bang. The stars would have formed on January 20, and the galaxies a few days later. Our sun didn't appear until August 31; life on Earth first appeared on September 21. And humans? We didn't show up until the last hour of the last day, December 31. Our entire history would be contained in the last 14 seconds.PHOTOS: WGA's top 101 showsMind-boggling, to be sure, but this was probably the weakest segment of the episode for me, perhaps because – like the Powers of Ten segment -- it felt so familiar. Yet it also contained that most famous line immortalized by Carl Sagan: ""We are made of star stuff.""Sagan’s memory can’t help but loom large, and the episode wisely opts to end with an homage of sorts. It turns out Tyson actually met Sagan when he was just 14, taking the train out to Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., where his idol met him at the station and gave him a tour of the campus. And he signed one of his books for the teen: “For Neil, a future astronomer. Carl.” That, right there, is why Sagan remains one of the most beloved scientists in the public sphere. “I already knew I wanted to be a scientist,” Tyson recalls. What he learned that day from Sagan was “the kind of person I wanted to become.”Ahem. Excuse me while I get a little verklempt. It was the perfect note on which to end the first episode. And it convinced me that Tyson is a fitting heir to the Sagan legacy. I’ll be eagerly tuning in for future episodes.ALSO:Watch 'Cosmos' Q&A with Neil deGrasse Tyson and Seth MacFarlaneReview: Neil deGrasse Tyson's 'Cosmos' a fascinating, fun place to beSeth MacFarlane hopes 'Cosmos' counteracts 'junk science,' creationism"	Science

593	DAVID BRANDT AP Sports WriterHOOVER, Ala. (AP) — Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel insists there are still plenty of superstars in the Southeastern Conference.The only problem is nobody’s heard of them yet.One year after high-profile players such as Alabama’s A.J. McCarron, South Carolina’s Jadeveon Clowney and Texas A&M’s Johnny Manziel brought a rockstar feel to SEC Media Days, the buzz is largely missing this week at the league’s preseason showcase.Part of the reason is a lack of experienced quarterbacks. McCarron, Manziel, LSU’s Zach Mettenberger, South Carolina’s Connor Shaw and Georgia’s Aaron Murray are gone after impressive careers.There are still some accomplished players in the league — especially at running back. Alabama’s T.J. Yeldon and Georgia’s Todd Gurley are among the nation’s best.Driskel said it won’t be long before others become nationally known as well.“Some of the guys haven’t put up the numbers or the championships that guys in the past have,” Driskell said. “But there’s always going to be talent in the SEC. It’s just a matter of who makes the plays this year. You get guys who end up being household names who weren’t at the beginning of the year.”But the shadow of Manziel, McCarron and Co. still looms, even months after they played their last college game.When Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin took the podium on Tuesday afternoon, two of the first three questions he received were about Johnny Football.After the second one, an amused Sumlin said “Is this the SEC Media Days?”The Aggies are one of several teams moving on without their stars. They had three players selected in the first round of the NFL draft — which left gaping holes at quarterback, offensive tackle and receiver — but Sumlin said that’s just part of the challenge of the college game.“In college football, every two, three years you’re going to have turnover and you have to have a plan for that,” Sumlin said. “Whether it’s quarterback, whether it’s a great defender, whatever it is. To me that’s what’s exciting about college football.”That might be true eventually, but right now it means there are a lot of unknowns.Arguably the league’s most recognizable quarterback — Auburn’s Nick Marshall — didn’t come to media days after being cited for possession of a small amount of marijuana. Mississippi’s Bo Wallace is the only returning quarterback in the league who threw for at least 2,000 yards last season.Mississippi State’s Dak Prescott and Driskel are among the most intriguing breakout candidates at quarterback.Prescott threw for 1,940 yards last season and rushed for 829 more as a sophomore despite missing two games because of injuries. Driskel had a promising season in 2012 before missing much of last year with a leg injury.Prescott said the SEC’s loss of so many star players won’t hurt the quality of the league.“Those guys were unknown at some point, too, so that’s just part of the game,” Prescott said. “It leaves the door open for guys to step up and get their name out there.”The strength of the league might be at running back, where veterans like Yeldon, Gurley and South Carolina’s Mike Davis return for another season. All three averaged around 100 yards per game during their sophomore seasons and scored at least 10 touchdowns.But there’s a good chance some of the league’s best players — along with the league’s best teams — are relative unknowns right now.“Nobody picked Missouri and Auburn to win the divisions last year,” South Carolina Steve Spurrier said. “That’s why we play the game. We don’t know who’s going to win ’em.”_____Follow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

594	"In the Gospel of Matthew, the Bible describes a mysterious star appearing over the place where Jesus Christ came to Earth in Bethlehem on the first Christmas, and leading wise men (known as the Magi) to find Jesus so they could visit him. People have debated what the Star of Bethlehem really was over the many years since the Bible's report was written. Some say it was a fable; others say it was a miracle. Still others get it confused with the North Star. Here's the story of what the Bible says happened and what many astronomers now believe about this famous celestial event:The Bible records the story in Matthew 2:1-11. Verses 1 and 2 say: ""After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, 'Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.'The story continues by describing how King Herod ""called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law"" and ""asked them where the Messiah was to be born"" (verse 4). They replied: ""In Bethlehem in Judea,"" (verse 5) and quote a prophecy about where the Messiah (the world's savior) will be born. Many scholars who knew the ancient prophecies well expected the Messiah to be born in Bethlehem.Verse 7 and 8 say: ""Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, 'Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.'"" Herod was lying to the Magi about his intentions; actually, Herod wanted to confirm Jesus' location so he could order soldiers to kill Jesus, because Herod saw Jesus as a threat to his own power.The story continues in verses 9 and 10: ""After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.""Then the Bible describes the Magi arriving at Jesus' house, visiting him with his mother Mary, worshiping him, and presenting him with their famous gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. Finally, verse 12 says of the Magi: ""... having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.""Over the years as people have debated whether or not a real star actually appeared over Jesus' home and led the Magi there, some people have said that the star was nothing more than a literary device -- a symbol for the apostle Matthew to use in his story to convey the light of hope that those who expected the Messiah's arrival felt when Jesus was born.During the many centuries of debates about the Star of Bethlehem, some people have surmised that the ""star"" was actually a bright angel in the sky.Why? Angels are messengers from God and the star was communicating an important message, and angels guide people and the star guided the Magi to Jesus. Also, Bible scholars believe that the Bible refers to angels as ""stars"" in several other places, such as Job 38:7 (""while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy"") and Psalm 147:4 (""He determines the number of stars and calls them each by name"")However, Bible scholars don't believe that the Star of Bethlehem passage in the Bible refers to an angel.Some people say that the Star of Bethlehem is a miracle -- either a light that God commanded to appear supernaturally, or a natural astronomical phenomenon that God miraculously caused to happen at that time in history. Many Bible scholars believe that the Star of Bethlehem was a miracle in the sense that God arranged parts of his natural creation in space to make an unusual phenomenon occur on the first Christmas. God's purpose for doing so, they believe, was to create a portent -- an omen, or sign, that would direct people's attention to something.In his book The Star of Bethlehem: The Legacy of the Magi, Michael R. Molnar writes that, ""There was indeed a great celestial portent during Herod’s reign, a portent that signified the birth of a great king of Judea and is in excellent agreement with the biblical account.""The unusual appearance and behavior of the star have inspired people to call it miraculous, but if it's a miracle, it's a miracle that can be explained naturally, some believe. Molnar later writes: ""If the theory that the Star of Bethlehem is an unexplainable miracle is put aside, there are several intriguing theories that relate the star to a specific celestial event. And often these theories strongly inclined toward advocating astronomical phenomena; that is, visible movement or positioning of celestial bodies, as portents.""In The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Geoffrey W. Bromiley writes about the Star of Bethlehem event: ""The God of the Bible is the creator of all celestial objects and they bear witness to Him. He can certainly intervene and change their natural course.""Since Psalm 19:1 of the Bible says that ""the heavens declare the glory of God"" all the time, God may have chosen them to bear witness to his incarnation on Earth in a special way through the star.Astronomers have debated over the years if the Star of Bethlehem was actually a star, or if it was a comet, a planet, or several planets coming together to create an especially bright light.Now that technology has progressed to the point where astronomers can scientifically analyze past events in space, many astronomers believe that they've identified what happened around the time that historians place Jesus’ birth: during the spring of the year 5 B.C.The answer, they say, is that the Star of Bethlehem really was truly a star -- an extraordinarily bright one, called a nova.In his book The Star of Bethlehem: An Astronomer's View, Mark R. Kidger writes that the Star of Bethlehem was ""almost certainly a nova"" that appeared in mid-March 5 B.C. ""somewhere between the modern constellations of Capricornus and Aquila"".""The Star of Bethlehem is a star,"" writes Frank J. Tipler in his book The Physics of Christianity. ""It is not a planet, or a comet, or a conjunction between two or more planets, or an occultation of Jupiter by the moon. ... if this account in Matthew’s Gospel is taken literally, then the Star of Bethlehem must have been a Type 1a supernova or a Type 1c hypernova, located either in the Andromeda Galaxy, or, if Type 1a, in a globular cluster of this galaxy.""Tipler adds that Matthew’s report of the star staying for a while over where Jesus was meant that the star ""passed through the zenith at Bethlehem"" at a latitude of 31 by 43 degrees north.It's important to keep in mind that this was a special astronomical event for that specific time in history and place in the world. So the Star of Bethlehem wasn't the North Star, which is a bright star that's commonly seen during the Christmas season. The North Star, called Polaris, shines over the North Pole and isn't related to the star that shone over Bethlehem on the first Christmas.Why would God send a star to lead people to Jesus on the first Christmas? It could have been because the star's bright light symbolized what the Bible later records Jesus saying about his mission on Earth: ""I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."" (John 8:12).Ultimately, writes Bromiley in The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, the question that matters most isn't what the Star of Bethlehem was, but to whom it lead people. ""One must realize that the narrative does not give a detailed description because the star itself was not important. It was mentioned only because it was a guide to the Christ child and a sign of His birth."" There was an error. Please try again.Thank you  for signing up."	Science

      It's only been a few years since the concept of reading articles and even books on a phone became a reality and already we're about to be introduced to the next phase of reading on digital devices.
  

      That's because many of the devices we will be carrying - or wearing, to be exact - come with much smaller screens.
  

      Take for instance, the smart watch or Google Glass, or even the fitness tracker with its sliver of a display. All of these are examples of the new wave of wearable devices which are about to hit the mass market.
  

      Enter Spritz. After three years in stealth mode, the start-up has taken the wrappers of a new service that promises to reinvent the way we read.
  

      Spritz is already being prototyped in an email app developed for the the new Samsung Gear 2 smart watch, which will be launching soon.
  

      The technology is based around Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), a concept that dates back to the 1970s and was later was used to improve reading efficiency through programs such as speed reading courses.
  

      While there are many advantages to improving the efficiency of reader and comprehension, purists will choke at the prospect of a system that looks like the optical equivalent of binge drinking.
  

      And anyone who loves typography, layout and the look and feel of the printed word, should probably stop reading here.
  
HOW TRADITIONAL READING WORKS


      The company says traditional reading - on a page or screen - requires the reader to move their eyes along a sentence, word to word sequentially seeking what Spritz calls the ""Optimal Recognition Point"" or ORP.
  

      This movement is called a saccade.
  

      Your eye skips along a sentence, much like the animation in a karaoke video when you vocalise the lyrics by following the bouncing ball.
  

      Sprtiz argues that traditional reading following the 80-20 rule: 80 per cent of your eye-brain activity is spent moving your eyeball. And only 20 per cent is spent processing the content you read.
  
HOW THE SPRITZ WAY OF READING WORKS


      The Spritz method streams words, one-at-a-time into a narrow window the company calls a ""redicle"".
  

      The redicle is designed to show up to 13 characters at a time, which also happens to be the maximum length word on which the eye can focus.
  

      It's a bit like flinging words at your eyeball. Your eye doesn't waste time and energy on saccadic activity and as a result you spend more time absorbing and processing the content.
  

      Spritz says it takes five minutes to train yourself to adapt to the rhythm and once that's done, you can read at speeds of up to 500 words a minute. It claims some early users are reaching speeds of 1000 words per minute.
  

      The average ""traditional"" reading speed is about 220 words per minute.

You can up the wpm rate as you learn how to Spritz, a process that takes about five minutes, per the developers. The letters in each word are in black font, except for one key letter which is in red. The app will come as a preinstalled email app on Samsung devices in April, but creators say they've been working in ""stealth mode,"" figuring out how to make mobile users more efficient readers. They found that we're slowed down by unnecessary eye movements. We can comprehend as well just by focusing our sight onto a single, left-of-center letter in each word. Spritz will help us do just that, as they explain: For each word, the eye seeks a certain point within the word, which we call the “Optimal Recognition Point” or ORP. After your eyes find the ORP, your brain starts to process the meaning of the word that you’re viewing. With each new word, your eyes move, called a “saccade”, and then your eyes seek out the ORP for that word. Once the ORP is found, processing the word for meaning and context occurs and your eyes move to the next word.Basically, they say, we don't need to read a word from left to right to understand its meaning. And when we do, we waste time; When reading, only around 20% of your time is spent processing content. The remaining 80% is spent physically moving your eyes from word to word and scanning for the next ORP.The app's co-founder and CEO Frank Waldman says Spritz is probably best used for shorter messages:  As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently. Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device – the options are almost limitless. Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.But that doesn't mean the app isn't ""working with some pretty big players in [the] field"" of ebooks, so that ""Atlas Shrugged in a day?"" can get the ""You betcha!"" answer promised in the company's FAQ section. Spritz knock-off OpenSpritz is already offering the option of Spritzing everything on the Internet, in the form of a ""free speed reading bookmarklet."" Or you can check out a similar, more legitimate app by the San Francisco Chronicle which allows you to Spritz an article about sharks. Though the overwhelming response to the app has been positive, some maintain reservations about this kind of reading:New tech called Spritz claims its users will be able to read at 1000 wpm. The demo hurt my head: http://t.co/CU89OXgsZhWe wonder whether apps like Spritz will affect our ability to actually retain information from what we read (though Spritz assures us that retention levels are up to par) while also remembering basic writing tools like, you know, spelling and grammar. Speed reading expert Greg Tyndall, also sees some limitations to the app,  telling the Telegraph that he thinks ""[Spritz] could be incredible for people who need to speed-read documents quickly, but it doesn’t give you techniques you can use offline at all – and sometimes we do still need to read a hard copy."" Which is true, for now.This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.
    From the Mayan ballgame Pitz to ancient Greece’s bull-leaping, here’s a tour of the history of athletic games.
The fumbling of domestic-violence accusations against Rob Porter is a story about the administration’s inability to tell the truth, not its disorganization.The White House’s response to allegations of domestic violence against former Staff Secretary Rob Porter has so stunned reporters that the whole episode has become an exemplar of the total disorganization of the Trump administration.“Abuse Case Exposes Fissures in a White House in Turmoil,” The New York Times intones. Axios’s Jonathan Swan writes, “This is crazy. Even in a White House that’s famous for chaos, I’ve never seen anything like this.” Politico’s Playbook simply announced, “CHAOS at 1600 Pennsylvania.”This is peculiar, not only because it is difficult to imagine what would rise to the level of notable chaos relative to the standards of this White House. It’s strange because the focus on disorder has overshadowed the more salient feature of the moment: Insofar as the administration is engulfed in chaos, it is a result of its inability to tell the truth. The Trump team doesn’t have a chaos problem so much as it has a dishonesty problem. Of course this is not new, either—in fact, the serial dissembling of the White House has become so banal that it goes almost unremarked in this case—yet it is on particularly dramatic display here.In the mid-1930s, the Federal Writers’ Project interviewed thousands of former slaves, some of whom claimed the president came to their plantations disguised as a beggar or a peddler, telling them they’d soon be free.Shortly before the election of 1860, a man came upon a plantation near Marlin, Texas, some 20 miles southeast of Waco. Though nobody knew who he was, the plantation owner took him in as a guest. The stranger paid close attention to how the enslaved people working on the plantation were treated—how they subsisted on a weekly ration of “four pounds of meat and a peck of meal,” how they were whipped and sometimes sold, resulting in the tearing apart of families. Eventually, the stranger said goodbye and went on his way, but a little while later he wrote a letter to the plantation owner, informing him he would soon have to free his slaves—“that everybody was going to have to, that the North was going to see to it.” The stranger told the owner to go into the room where he’d slept, and see where he’d carved his name into the headrest. And when the slaveholder went and looked, he saw the name: “A. Lincoln.”Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald rose to the occasion with their paintings of the former president and first lady, while—importantly—continuing their radical projects in black portraiture.Jasmine, African blue lilies, and Chicago’s favorite flower, chrysanthemum, flourish in the botanical backdrop of President Barack Obama’s official portrait. The 44th president appears seated in an ornate chair, with leafy vines threatening to climb up his pant leg.In her official portrait, First Lady Michelle Obama appears seated, too, in a flowing dress designed by Milly. Between her gown, with its touches of geometric patterning, and the sky-blue paint that frames her figure, the painting features a lot of hard-edged abstraction.On Monday, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled the Obamas’ official portraits. President Obama’s portrait, by the Los Angeles–born and New York–based artist Kehinde Wiley, will join the museum’s hall of American presidents, where it will permanently disrupt the march of white presidential paintings. The portrait of Michelle Obama, the work of Baltimore’s Amy Sherald, will be on view with recent acquisitions through November 2018.From Donald Trump to recent op-eds, the male perspective remains—stubbornly, perniciously—the default point of view.The tweet, as so often happens, was at once shocking and deeply predictable.Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused—life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?That was President Trump, on Saturday, ostensibly reacting to the fact that, this week, allegations of domestic abuse led to the resignations of two high-level staffers at the White House. He was also, obliquely, weighing in on #MeToo. The president’s 48-word assessment of the reckoning so many Americans are painfully but productively engaged in made for rich (but thoroughly unsurprising) irony: Trump, of course, has been accused of sexual impropriety by 19 women—and has also been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault, and has also boasted, on national television, about advising friends to “be rougher” toward their wives, and has also been elected president of the United States. His tweet is revealing both in spite and because of those facts: “Peoples[sic],” in the plural; allegation, in the singular. The peoples meaning the “men’s”; the allegation—though in its context, the diminishing adjective is redundant—being a “mere” one.Republican lawmakers are increasingly showing disdain for decisions made by the judicial branch—and by extension the rule of law.An old legal anecdote—attributed to such legal notables as Mae West and the Earl of Birkenhead—depicts a frustrated judge asking an obstreperous lawyer, “Are you displaying contempt of court?”“No, your honor,” the advocate responds. “I am trying to conceal it.”I sometimes think simple politeness—a willingness to conceal contempt for other parties, judges, and even law itself—is all that differentiates true lawyers from thugs in contrast-collar shirts. But like other areas of public etiquette, this habitual courtesy is showing strain in the era of Donald Trump.Trump likes to denounce and threaten judges courts that thwart his will. But the political threat to courts did not begin with Trump and will not end when he is gone. It is part of a civic rot that is eating at the vitals of our democracy, and it is getting worse.Americans would be less alienated from one another and solve problems more easily if they recognized one little-noticed distinction in policy debates.We sometimes think of political issues in binary terms. Is someone pro-life or pro-choice? But most individuals hold views that are more complicated than a binary can capture.An alternative is to describe a given position on a spectrum. On abortion, an outright ban sits at one extreme; at the other is the elimination of all restrictions on the procedure. In between are a staggering array of coherently distinguishable positions.Politicians seeking to win votes express their stances either in terms of a binary or as a spot on a spectrum, depending on where they see the greatest advantage. Though their beliefs don’t change, how they frame them makes a political difference.* * *There’s a different set of frames, though, that are as relevant as binaries and spectrums, though they are less familiar and less discussed: equilibriums and limits.How to make sense of axels, edges, flips, and moreThis article is from the archive of our partner .Let's make no bones about it: the headlining sport in the Winter Olympics is figure skating. No other sport comes close to the drama, the athletes, the subplots, and politics that figure skating has. For skaters, all those hours, jumps and training are boiled down to around six or seven minutes. That's what makes the Olympics' skating competition so wonderful and so heartbreaking: skaters don't necessarily have to be the best, they just have to be the best for seven minutes (see: Lipinski, Tara).That's why we watch. For most of us though, the benchmark of a good skate is not falling (part of the reason people were surprised that Mirai Nagasu didn't make the Olympic team despite skating a clean program). To the untrained eye, a skater just transforms into a spinning blur for a few nanoseconds, and then lands (or doesn't) while we hold our breath.They might be an efficient way to produce food in a world with more-extreme weather—but only if growers can figure out a successful business model.Federico Marques feared the worst for his farm as he watched live coverage of Hurricane Harvey ravaging fields across the Gulf Coast and inundating every pocket of Houston.Marques was trapped at home during Harvey and could only monitor his crops from his couch, anxiously viewing footage from the farm’s single working indoor camera. “We couldn’t get in here for four days,” Marques said as he showed me around on an unseasonably warm afternoon this November. “I’m looking at all these aerial photos and thinking, ‘Oh my God, everything is underwater.’ When we finally got back, we had 10 inches of water on the floor—but we only lost maybe 5 percent of the product. The rest was perfectly fine.”In a way, Harvey was a test for Moonflower Farms. Founded by Marques in December 2015, it was one of the state’s very first indoor “vertical” farms—where plants are stacked in trays on shelves, instead of laid out horizontally across larger plots of land. In these high-tech structures, plants don’t rely on sunlight or soil, rainwater or pesticides, but LED lights and minerals instead. The goal of vertical farms isn’t just to save space; it’s also to find a more economical way of producing food for the growing population—and to reduce the costs and consequences of getting that food to where people actually live.The surprise release of The Cloverfield Paradox, along with acquisitions of other schlocky genre movies, suggests the company is leaning in to its “direct-to-video” approach.Just a year ago, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Netflix was a big player. The streaming company was a little more than a year into releasing its own original movies for its subscribers, and it was looking for prestige hits to gain a foothold as a distributor Hollywood could take seriously. It acquired one of the best-reviewed films of the festival, Mudbound, for $12.5 million, and the Grand Jury Prize winner I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, among others. In terms of prestige, Netflix was lagging behind its competitor Amazon, which had nabbed a Best Picture nomination for its major Sundance acquisition of 2016, Manchester by the Sea. Maybe Netflix’s new slate of indie favorites would turn things around.“The women scholars here are even more important than men.”Morocco is in a region vulnerable to terrorist recruitment, but it hasn’t had a significant attack on its own soil since 2011, when terrorists bombed a Marrakesh café. Yet ethnic Moroccans have been at the center of ISIS attacks in Europe. The only alleged survivor of the 2015 Paris rampage is a Frenchman of Moroccan origin; his trial began last week. The men behind the Brussels airport and tram bombings that happened months later were also ethnic Moroccans. The suspected driver of the van that mowed down shoppers in Barcelona was Moroccan-born.Some 1,600 Moroccans are thought to have joined extremist groups, mainly ISIS, since 2012, with some 300 still fighting with ISIS, according to Moroccan Interior Ministry figures. Although these figures are low compared to, say, Tunisia’s—some 7,000 Tunisians joined the group over the same period—the death toll in Europe has brought into focus the need for prevention and Morocco has come to play an outsized role in the debate over how, exactly, young people can be stopped from embracing radical Islam.In a StoryCorps animation, Patrick Haggerty remembers the remarkable advice he got from his dairy farmer dad.It’s an incredible story.

Spritz, a new app that debuted at last month’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, wants to reinvent how you read and get you bolting through books while you do it. It will be loaded on Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Gear 2 smartwatch devices as an email app that moves away from scrolling, swiping, and pinching by streaming words one at a time at the user’s reading speed.Spritz’s technology streams words individually using a display called a Redicle, which keeps the eye centered on the same place as each new word appears. According to Spritz’s research, the most time-consuming part of reading is the act of the eye moving from word to word across the page. In aligning the word, as seen in the nearby example, the brain and eye don’t have to waste time processing movement and can get on to the reading. Finally conquer A Song of Ice and Fire!In addition to English, Spritz supports Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Korean, and is working on getting the app to customers beyond the new Samsung gadgets soon. If you need to get kick-start your reading time now, read on for more apps that’ll have you zooming through books.As its name suggests, Velocity ($3) wants to push your reading time to superhuman levels. The app, specifically made for the iOS 7 interface, also uses a one-word-at-a-time approach, but it’s the integration into the iPhone ecosystem that we love. Avid users of Instapaper and Pocket can speed read the articles saved in those services through Velocity, so you can perfect this habit with materials that’ll captivate you.Androidians, the free Speed Reading Trainer promises to get you up to 500 words per minute in two weeks. Continue to check your progress as you increase read times with the app’s diagnostic tool.Turn your speed-reading practice into a game with Acceleread (iOS, free with in-app upgrades starting at $5), which lets you create measurable goals within its training course program. Receive gold stars and trophies when you reach reading goals and track your progress with charts that show your current speed, highest speed, and average speed.

 Samples on a website showcasing the app allow users to read phrases at speeds between 250 and 600 words per minute in languages including French, Russian, German and Spanish as well as English.  “When reading, only around 20% of your time is spent processing content,” the creators explain. “The remaining 80% is spent physically moving your eyes from word to word and scanning for the next ORP. With Spritz we help you get all that time back.”  They suggest the technology would be particularly useful for people who spend much of their time at work reading emails. While there is no launch date for iPhone or Android apps, the company says it is in negotiations to bring Spritz to as wide an audience as possible.   Its creators also claim to be working with “some pretty big players” in the field of digital books, and say it will soon be possible for readers to digest weighty tomes in a matter of hours.  At around 560,000 in the English translation, it would take readers under 10 hours to plough through the whole of War and Peace at the app’s top speed without breaks.  Greg Tyndall, head of speed reading at the corporate training company GA training, said it was a “natty tool” but suggested it was unlikely the app would revolutionise reading beyond emails and shorter reports.  “I think it could be incredible for people who need to speed-read documents quickly, but it doesn’t give you techniques you can use offline at all – and sometimes we do still need to read a hard copy,” he said.   “You can’t take notes because you can’t take your eyes off the screen, but it would be good for getting an overview of a document.”  So will Tolstoy’s masterpiece not be brought to a whole new, time-poor audience? “I can imagine maybe 10 per cent of people wanting to use this to read for pleasure,"" Tyndall said.  “But the War and Peace thing is the biggest cliché there is. You don’t learn to speed-read so you can get through that quickly.” In The Filter

603	"A new app promises to help you read novels in minutes. Here's why it might not work.The internet is wonderful and terrible in its volume. It allows us to read anything, but it gives us entirely too much to read. That memo. That email. This article. We are all bailing water out of a leaky info-boat.Most smartphone apps contribute to this deluge of facts. “Save this to read later,” they offer, as though “later” you won’t have better things to read. Refresh your Twitter feed ... or download our magazine app! (Seriously though, do it, if you want to be a thought leader.)But one app promises to be part of the solution. Spritz, its creators say, will speed up reading time by flashing just one word of an article or book at a time inside a text box. It will center each word around its Optimal Recognition Point (ORP), the point at which most readers recognize its meaning. Users can set the pace at which the words zoom by—currently, the app can go up to 600 words per minute, about double the normal reading speed.“Reading is inherently time-consuming because your eyes have to move from word to word and line to line,” the creators write. That movement is called the ""saccade,"" and each one takes about a tenth of a second.The idea is to cut down on the saccades and get straight to the good stuff—the ORP—which Spritz highlights in red as each word appears.Facebook feeds were unanimous: Spritz could be life-changing.“OMG I need this!” gushed a typical response. Think how many more Facebook exclamations you could post if you weren’t wasting all your time moving your eyes between words like a chump.“Quit teasing and release the app already!” one man demanded on the app’s Facebook page a few weeks ago. Others have offered to be beta-testers. Still others have predicted a new world order:“There are only a handful of times when one can remember when a piece of tech totally changed the world and those in it. May I be so bold as to suggest, that this could be one of those times??”Could it be??***This is actually the second coming of speed reading. In the 1950s, a schoolteacher named Evelyn Nielsen Wood discovered that she could read at a much faster pace than the normal 250-300 words per minute by sweeping a finger along the page as she read, reading entire groups of words at a time, and by avoiding sub-vocalization, or saying each word mentally.These techniques helped Wood reach 2,700 read words per minute, she claimed, and it was these principles she espoused in Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics, her speed-reading business. The comedian Steve Allen hawked the program in TV commercials, and over the years multiple iterations of White House staffers signed up. A generation of lawyers and bibliophiles flocked to speed-reading classes that sprang up in community colleges and on mail-order services.By the 90s, though, the speed-reading craze slumped again. Perhaps because its students found the method to be harder than it sounded, or perhaps because those early Clinton years were simply a chiller time.Things have changed once again, though. We now read an average of 54,000 words a day by some estimates, roughly the length of a novel. Meanwhile, media companies have cruelly conspired to make “longform” cool again, so now everything you actually want to read is twice as long as it needs to be.“Did you read that?!” the hipster bookworms on Portlandia shout at one another before shoving pages of a magazine in their mouths, thereby admitting that to stay well-read these days you’d have to physically consume articles, not unlike a human flatbed scanner.Some forms of what we call “speed reading” are actually skimming -- the reader saves time by not reading every word on the page. And skimming might be useful, in some cases. If you’re pressed for time, it might be preferable to skim the entire text rather than to read linearly through just part of it. A 2009 study found that skimmers did not remember very many details, nor could they make inferences from the text. But they did remember the story’s most important ideas better than those who tried to read normally but didn’t finish the piece.Wood, the speed-reading entrepreneur, ardently believed that fast readers were good readers.""My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation,"" Wood once told the New York Times. ""I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste?""But most research points to the opposite conclusion: As speed increases, comprehension deteriorates.In the World Championship Speed Reading Competition, top contestants read about 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute, but they only understand about half of what they take in. One study of 16 high-performing people, including self-proclaimed “speed-readers” found that none could read faster than 600 words per minute while understanding at least three-quarters of the information.Keith Rayner, a psycholinguist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told me that he thinks “all speed-reading claims are nonsensical.”
Spritz’ technique, called rapid serial visual presentation, or RSVP, isn’t new, and Rayner said it causes the same comprehension problems as other strategies.

“We've known forever that people can go fast with one word at a time,” he said. “But if you have them read more than single sentences, then comprehension breaks down because words are coming at you faster than you can deal with them.”Less-common words take longer to read than typical ones. You can’t look back with RSVP reading, Rayner explained, so working memory overloads. The reader loses her place and starts missing words, and the word-stream becomes more of a blur than a book.“There are severe limits on how rapidly the mind can combine word concepts to form the idea units ... that define our comprehension of text,” Michael Masson, a psychologist at the University of Victoria, told me via email.What differentiates fast and slow readers is not how they read, he points out, but their overall language skills and vocabularies.I asked him if there is any way to get faster at reading.“Some modest gains in speed can be achieved by having greater knowledge of the subject matter (an expert in a field will read faster than a novice),” he wrote. “Beginning readers can expect to read faster as they gain more practice, but eventually we each reach some upper limit. The simple answer, then, is ‘read more.'”***I Spritzed the “about” text on the company’s site. That’s the only thing available right now for Apple-bound people like me, but the app is already out on Samsung.It worked, sort of. I was able to cruise along at 600 words per minute, and I only had to use the “pause” button occasionally.Still, it felt more like a game than a reading experience. The words blazed by, leaving little time for digestion. Despite the speed-reading community’s warning against “subvocalizing,” the frantic pace made me think of the voice of some sort of animated mouse.“Spritzhasbeenworkingfornearly3yearsin’StealthMode,’” he squeaked breathlessly, “toperfectourreadingmethodology.”I could see myself Spritzing through a tedious-yet-necessary white paper, say, or some nonessential emails. But much of the press coverage has emphasized that Spritz users would be able to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in just 77 minutes or The Bible in 13 hours. I’m sure that’s technically possible—and it sure would add a little zip to all those “begats”— but I’m not certain it’s ideal.Wanting to speed through a good book sounds as illogical as rushing through lunch with a hilarious friend. It’s no coincidence that the motto for the World Speed Reading Council is “Hoc opus, hic labor est.” Translation: This is the hard work; this is the toil.“There are lots of fallen away speed readers like myself,'' Marcel Just, a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon, once told the Orlando Sentinel. ''The reason with me, and with others I've spoken to, is it's exhausting. You speed read something in 10 minutes that would otherwise take half an hour, then you have to lie down for 20 minutes and rest up.''But maybe apps like Spritz (there will doubtless be copycats) aren’t meant for Ulysses. That is, they’re not for reading; they’re for obligatory information processing—all the digital chaff we sort through with each glance at the RSS reader or inbox. And maybe that’s why we really do “OMG need” things like Spritz these days. Not for the joy of reading, but for the duty.
    From the Mayan ballgame Pitz to ancient Greece’s bull-leaping, here’s a tour of the history of athletic games.
The fumbling of domestic-violence accusations against Rob Porter is a story about the administration’s inability to tell the truth, not its disorganization.The White House’s response to allegations of domestic violence against former Staff Secretary Rob Porter has so stunned reporters that the whole episode has become an exemplar of the total disorganization of the Trump administration.“Abuse Case Exposes Fissures in a White House in Turmoil,” The New York Times intones. Axios’s Jonathan Swan writes, “This is crazy. Even in a White House that’s famous for chaos, I’ve never seen anything like this.” Politico’s Playbook simply announced, “CHAOS at 1600 Pennsylvania.”This is peculiar, not only because it is difficult to imagine what would rise to the level of notable chaos relative to the standards of this White House. It’s strange because the focus on disorder has overshadowed the more salient feature of the moment: Insofar as the administration is engulfed in chaos, it is a result of its inability to tell the truth. The Trump team doesn’t have a chaos problem so much as it has a dishonesty problem. Of course this is not new, either—in fact, the serial dissembling of the White House has become so banal that it goes almost unremarked in this case—yet it is on particularly dramatic display here.In the mid-1930s, the Federal Writers’ Project interviewed thousands of former slaves, some of whom claimed the president came to their plantations disguised as a beggar or a peddler, telling them they’d soon be free.Shortly before the election of 1860, a man came upon a plantation near Marlin, Texas, some 20 miles southeast of Waco. Though nobody knew who he was, the plantation owner took him in as a guest. The stranger paid close attention to how the enslaved people working on the plantation were treated—how they subsisted on a weekly ration of “four pounds of meat and a peck of meal,” how they were whipped and sometimes sold, resulting in the tearing apart of families. Eventually, the stranger said goodbye and went on his way, but a little while later he wrote a letter to the plantation owner, informing him he would soon have to free his slaves—“that everybody was going to have to, that the North was going to see to it.” The stranger told the owner to go into the room where he’d slept, and see where he’d carved his name into the headrest. And when the slaveholder went and looked, he saw the name: “A. Lincoln.”Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald rose to the occasion with their paintings of the former president and first lady, while—importantly—continuing their radical projects in black portraiture.Jasmine, African blue lilies, and Chicago’s favorite flower, chrysanthemum, flourish in the botanical backdrop of President Barack Obama’s official portrait. The 44th president appears seated in an ornate chair, with leafy vines threatening to climb up his pant leg.In her official portrait, First Lady Michelle Obama appears seated, too, in a flowing dress designed by Milly. Between her gown, with its touches of geometric patterning, and the sky-blue paint that frames her figure, the painting features a lot of hard-edged abstraction.On Monday, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled the Obamas’ official portraits. President Obama’s portrait, by the Los Angeles–born and New York–based artist Kehinde Wiley, will join the museum’s hall of American presidents, where it will permanently disrupt the march of white presidential paintings. The portrait of Michelle Obama, the work of Baltimore’s Amy Sherald, will be on view with recent acquisitions through November 2018.From Donald Trump to recent op-eds, the male perspective remains—stubbornly, perniciously—the default point of view.The tweet, as so often happens, was at once shocking and deeply predictable.Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused—life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?That was President Trump, on Saturday, ostensibly reacting to the fact that, this week, allegations of domestic abuse led to the resignations of two high-level staffers at the White House. He was also, obliquely, weighing in on #MeToo. The president’s 48-word assessment of the reckoning so many Americans are painfully but productively engaged in made for rich (but thoroughly unsurprising) irony: Trump, of course, has been accused of sexual impropriety by 19 women—and has also been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault, and has also boasted, on national television, about advising friends to “be rougher” toward their wives, and has also been elected president of the United States. His tweet is revealing both in spite and because of those facts: “Peoples[sic],” in the plural; allegation, in the singular. The peoples meaning the “men’s”; the allegation—though in its context, the diminishing adjective is redundant—being a “mere” one.Republican lawmakers are increasingly showing disdain for decisions made by the judicial branch—and by extension the rule of law.An old legal anecdote—attributed to such legal notables as Mae West and the Earl of Birkenhead—depicts a frustrated judge asking an obstreperous lawyer, “Are you displaying contempt of court?”“No, your honor,” the advocate responds. “I am trying to conceal it.”I sometimes think simple politeness—a willingness to conceal contempt for other parties, judges, and even law itself—is all that differentiates true lawyers from thugs in contrast-collar shirts. But like other areas of public etiquette, this habitual courtesy is showing strain in the era of Donald Trump.Trump likes to denounce and threaten judges courts that thwart his will. But the political threat to courts did not begin with Trump and will not end when he is gone. It is part of a civic rot that is eating at the vitals of our democracy, and it is getting worse.Americans would be less alienated from one another and solve problems more easily if they recognized one little-noticed distinction in policy debates.We sometimes think of political issues in binary terms. Is someone pro-life or pro-choice? But most individuals hold views that are more complicated than a binary can capture.An alternative is to describe a given position on a spectrum. On abortion, an outright ban sits at one extreme; at the other is the elimination of all restrictions on the procedure. In between are a staggering array of coherently distinguishable positions.Politicians seeking to win votes express their stances either in terms of a binary or as a spot on a spectrum, depending on where they see the greatest advantage. Though their beliefs don’t change, how they frame them makes a political difference.* * *There’s a different set of frames, though, that are as relevant as binaries and spectrums, though they are less familiar and less discussed: equilibriums and limits.How to make sense of axels, edges, flips, and moreThis article is from the archive of our partner .Let's make no bones about it: the headlining sport in the Winter Olympics is figure skating. No other sport comes close to the drama, the athletes, the subplots, and politics that figure skating has. For skaters, all those hours, jumps and training are boiled down to around six or seven minutes. That's what makes the Olympics' skating competition so wonderful and so heartbreaking: skaters don't necessarily have to be the best, they just have to be the best for seven minutes (see: Lipinski, Tara).That's why we watch. For most of us though, the benchmark of a good skate is not falling (part of the reason people were surprised that Mirai Nagasu didn't make the Olympic team despite skating a clean program). To the untrained eye, a skater just transforms into a spinning blur for a few nanoseconds, and then lands (or doesn't) while we hold our breath.They might be an efficient way to produce food in a world with more-extreme weather—but only if growers can figure out a successful business model.Federico Marques feared the worst for his farm as he watched live coverage of Hurricane Harvey ravaging fields across the Gulf Coast and inundating every pocket of Houston.Marques was trapped at home during Harvey and could only monitor his crops from his couch, anxiously viewing footage from the farm’s single working indoor camera. “We couldn’t get in here for four days,” Marques said as he showed me around on an unseasonably warm afternoon this November. “I’m looking at all these aerial photos and thinking, ‘Oh my God, everything is underwater.’ When we finally got back, we had 10 inches of water on the floor—but we only lost maybe 5 percent of the product. The rest was perfectly fine.”In a way, Harvey was a test for Moonflower Farms. Founded by Marques in December 2015, it was one of the state’s very first indoor “vertical” farms—where plants are stacked in trays on shelves, instead of laid out horizontally across larger plots of land. In these high-tech structures, plants don’t rely on sunlight or soil, rainwater or pesticides, but LED lights and minerals instead. The goal of vertical farms isn’t just to save space; it’s also to find a more economical way of producing food for the growing population—and to reduce the costs and consequences of getting that food to where people actually live.The surprise release of The Cloverfield Paradox, along with acquisitions of other schlocky genre movies, suggests the company is leaning in to its “direct-to-video” approach.Just a year ago, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Netflix was a big player. The streaming company was a little more than a year into releasing its own original movies for its subscribers, and it was looking for prestige hits to gain a foothold as a distributor Hollywood could take seriously. It acquired one of the best-reviewed films of the festival, Mudbound, for $12.5 million, and the Grand Jury Prize winner I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore, among others. In terms of prestige, Netflix was lagging behind its competitor Amazon, which had nabbed a Best Picture nomination for its major Sundance acquisition of 2016, Manchester by the Sea. Maybe Netflix’s new slate of indie favorites would turn things around.“The women scholars here are even more important than men.”Morocco is in a region vulnerable to terrorist recruitment, but it hasn’t had a significant attack on its own soil since 2011, when terrorists bombed a Marrakesh café. Yet ethnic Moroccans have been at the center of ISIS attacks in Europe. The only alleged survivor of the 2015 Paris rampage is a Frenchman of Moroccan origin; his trial began last week. The men behind the Brussels airport and tram bombings that happened months later were also ethnic Moroccans. The suspected driver of the van that mowed down shoppers in Barcelona was Moroccan-born.Some 1,600 Moroccans are thought to have joined extremist groups, mainly ISIS, since 2012, with some 300 still fighting with ISIS, according to Moroccan Interior Ministry figures. Although these figures are low compared to, say, Tunisia’s—some 7,000 Tunisians joined the group over the same period—the death toll in Europe has brought into focus the need for prevention and Morocco has come to play an outsized role in the debate over how, exactly, young people can be stopped from embracing radical Islam.In a StoryCorps animation, Patrick Haggerty remembers the remarkable advice he got from his dairy farmer dad.It’s an incredible story.

605	A new app is about to come on the market with promises to dramatically increase the speed at which you read. Spritz is a text-streaming technology that allows you to read a sentence, one word at a time. Each word is shown for only a brief flash, in the same place on a screen, before the next appears.Up to 1,000 words can be shown every minute, which would allow you to race through an entire novel in just 90 minutes. This could revolutionize the way we read, particularly on small-screen devices, such as smartphones and smartwatches.How it worksWhen we read, our eyes normally make a series of brief pauses to extract information before moving on. These are referred to as eye movement fixations and saccades. It is only during fixations that the eye processes what is before it.Spritz allows you to read faster by presenting words in the same place on the screen. This means that the eye can remain in the same spot and does not have to waste time making lengthy saccades to get to the next word.When we read we have to recognize words. Spritz supports this by focusing our attention on the most informative part of a word so that we recognize it quickly – the word’s optimal recognition position. This is done by highlighting the letter that should be fixated in a different color to the rest. Doing this grabs our attention and makes us fixate at that point.Spritz also takes into account some of the factors that explain why we don’t fixate on each word for the same length of time. Rather than reading each letter in a word, our visual system is able to process common words as whole units, using the context of the text and the overall shape of the word as clues to aid recognition. This means that words that are very similar to each other in shape, like “bed” and “fed,” will require more time to process than words that are more distinct, like “decide.” Spritz therefore slows down when displaying very short words and speeds up for words that are four to seven letters long.Reading or skimming?Reading is more than just moving your eyes across a page. It is a cognitive activity. Our brain is busy processing the meaning of the words that have been read. For demanding content or tasks, this cognitive processing can take time. We naturally compensate for this by lingering on some words for longer than others to give our brains time to process the meaning of what we are reading.The spritz website hints that some in-house testing has been done and claims people are able to perform well when tested for their comprehension and recall of a text that they have just “spritzed.”But there’s a potential problem with treating all words equally and pushing everything through a high-speed funnel. Experiments using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), participants have demonstrated attentional blink. They were more likely to miss something important because their attention is occupied by something else that they had just experienced. For example, if you’ve just read an emotionally charged word such as “coffin” or “murder,” you’re more likely to miss something important if it occurs very soon afterwards.The current system doesn’t appear to offer any deeper adaption to the content that is being presented. It doesn’t slow down if a main character dies suddenly, or a complex idea is presented in a sentence. This is not so surprising as this would be an extremely difficult technological problem to solve.Spritz does slow down at the end of sentences to provide the reader with a little extra time to process the sentence that has just been read. But this might not be sufficient. In fact, readers frequently re-read sections of text when it did not make complete sense on the first pass – something that is not possible with this system.Spritz users might find themselves missing important information that they would have caught with regular reading as a result.So while this technology could open up fantastic opportunities for reading small snippets of text, such as a tweet, on a very small screen, there’s probably some way to go in the development of the technology before you’d want to read War and Peace on a smart watch.Courtesy of The Conversation.View the discussion thread.© Copyright 2018 Advantage Business Media	Science
606	"Can you imagine reading 600 word per minute? 5 books in a day? 10 emails in one minute? Well with Spritz, all of this may be possible.Spritz is a new speed-reading app that allows users to read up to 600 words per minute.The concept behind the software is that moving your eyes across the page when reading takes the most time, but if you see the word flashed in the same position, you are able to read much faster.Spritz also focuses on key letters within each word, highlighting them red to ensure their meaning is retained. This is called “Optimal Recognition Point” or ORP.The average person reads about 250 words per minute when they have to move their eyes across the page, but keeping the words in one spot allows readers to reach speeds of up to 600 word per minute.“When reading, only around 20% of your time is spent processing content,” the creators explain. “The remaining 80% is spent physically moving your eyes from word to word and scanning for the next ORP. With Spritz we help you get all that time back.”Spritz would be most beneficial to those who need to read numerous emails, scripts, books or documents however Greg Tyndall, head of a speed reading company states, “I think it could be incredible for people who need to speed-read documents quickly, but it doesn’t give you techniques you can use offline at all – and sometimes we do still need to read a hard copy.”The Boston based company is yet to reveal a launch date but they have a website where people can test out the software and a sample is available for Android users to download.Spritz is apparently also working with digital book companies and publishers but have not released any further information.

608	"Topping tech headlines over the weekend, AT&T; announced price cut for its 2GB Mobile Share Value plan.Now $40a $15 dropthe plan comes with the option to add the cost of a smartphone to the mobile plan: $25 for non-contract devices, and $40 for two-year smartphone agreements. AT&T; is also allowing current 2GB Mobile Share Value customers to temporarily benefit from the reduced price. It remains unclear whether the same deal applies to users with a larger service plan. Those carrying a 1GB plan, however, are out of luck, as AT&T; on Sunday shuttered that option.In other smartphone news, comScore released a new mobile market report, and Apple took the No. 1 smartphone manufacturer position, followed by Samsung. Cupertino topped Samsung with 41.6 percent of the market compared to 26.7 percent; LG came in third with 7 percent. Motorola and HTC come in at 6.4 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively.

609	"In the age of the Internet, we now read thousands of words per day via web pages, emails, and even eBooks and other texts. Sometimes, reading this many words can take a long time, which cuts into our valuable time. However, guess what? There's a fix for that problem, and it's called Spritz.  Spritz is a text streaming technology that allows readers to run through texts faster. It streams text on the user's screen one word at a time, which allows your brain to comprehend it faster, says the company behind the technology.  ""We're reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices,"" said co-Founder and CEO Frank Waldman. ""As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently. Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device - the options are almost limitless. Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.""  The company claims Spritz can allow an eBook reader to run through a novel in just 90 minutes. That sounds great, but we're not sure if any eBook reader would be interested in speed reading a book, wouldn't that dim the experience and the enjoyment of the book a great deal? We believe this to be true.  How does the tech work?  Spritz streams one word at a time as noted above. It highlights the ""Optimal Recognition Point"" or ORP of every word in the red, and align certain letters to a specific central point. Apparently, this technique can allow readers to read up to 1,000 words per minute. Then again, it all depends on the user's comfort level, so it should be very possible for the speed to be toned down a little bit.  It shouldn't take too long for us to see Spritz in action on smart devices.

610	What if you could read a thousand-page book in a matter of hours?Gravity’s Rainbow on the train to work. Infinite Jest during an afternoon on the hammock. Crime and Punishment over a lunch break or two. With the technologically facilitated speed-reading offered by a new app, called Spritz, soon to be released for the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Gear 2 Watch, it just might be possible.The app works by maximizing the efficiency of the movements of the human eye, called saccades, that are required to read text in a traditional format. As explained on Spritz’s website, while reading, the eye searches for the middle of a word before the word can be comprehended. This particular area, located slightly to the left of the mid-point of the word, is called the “Optimal Recognition Point” (ORP). By lining up the words of a text based on their ORP and flashing them rapidly in succession around the same middle point, highlighted in red, the reader never has to expend time by moving his eye, and is able to process what he is reading much more quickly.Spritz claims that, while reading traditionally, the brain spends only about 20% of the time processing and comprehending the meaning of the words, while the other 80% is dedicated merely to acquisition. Using this method, Spritz users can achieve speeds of a thousand words-per-minute with relative ease, compared to the average natural speed of between 200-400 WPM.The demonstrations provided on their website show just how easy it is to pick up. With no preparation or learning curve at all, I was almost immediately blazing away at 600wpm, with full retention, and wishing I could test myself at faster speeds (there is currently no faster demonstration available).Compare Spritz’s method to other speed-reading techniques—such as sub-vocalization—in which the reader hums or speaks to himself in order to train the brain not to internally recite the word before understanding it. This method, and others like it, require a great deal of practice and focus, whereas Spritz seems to have developed a method that requires almost no effort at all. But Spritz is more than just a speed-reading app; since the presentation only requires the space to display one word at a time, it’s prefect for reading on small screens, such as those used in the wearable devices (“watch phones”) that are currently on the cusp of popularity. The website explains: “From the fonts that we use to the algorithms that process content, Spritz is designed from the ground up to empower effective reading on a small display area.”Assisted-reading technology such as this will certainly be a great new topic of debate between the camps that love to declare themselves on any issue even remotely literary; just see how staunchly “paper-book people” (and I’m one of them) hold out against the tide of convenient e-readers, clinging to our silly notions of aesthetics.This, however, seems like a slightly different case. Think of your most cherished reading experiences over the course of your life: the summer in you spent lugging around Stephen King’s The Stand, the vacation that you devoured a book of Lorrie Moore short stories. Isn’t the fact that the book was in your life for a significant period of time part of why it felt so special? Would you want to condense all of that into a few hours?Surely, if reading solely to acquire information or subjects to discuss at cocktail parties, new apps such as these will be a great convenience. But for those of us who cleave to backwards ideas about how certain books, fiction especially, deserve a slower air of contemplation, it might take some more convincing.	Science
611	"An app that is currently in the pipeline and on its way soon, hopes to change the way we read with claims that it will help you read through text 80% times faster than normal.Spritz uses a reader’s Optimal Recognition Point (ORP), which is the focal point that the eye seeks within a word, and shows words with the ORP located at the specific place where you’re already looking (such as the centre of the screen), so that you don’t have to move your eyes across the screen when reading.You start off by reading 250 words per minute (wpm) and gradually increase your speed to 1 000 wpm, which i the highest speed on Spritz.At the moment, Spritz is only available to developers although the company was invited to bring the app to the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Gear 2 smartwatch at Mobile World Congress and will be available on the two devices.The app isn’t readily available at the moment but in the meantime you can head over to the Spritz website to try your hand at spritzing. Some important things you should know about this site.Unlike many news sites, we don’t necessarily proclaim that our reporting will always be unbiased, although we do maintain that most of the time it is.

612	"The digital era is bombarding us with words, a torrent of e-mails, texts, and tweets that at some point can be just too much.But what if, stripped to its simplest form, all we saw wasOneWordAtATime.Imagine a text message, e-mail, even a long news article, displayed as a series of single-word flashcards, moving so quickly you could read 600 words a minute — more, even.That’s the simple explanation behind a radical new reading technology a Boston-area company is developing for this era of small screens.“It’s a little shocking at first,” admits Frank Waldman, chief executive of Spritz Technology Inc., in North Reading. “It’s like, ‘Oh my God, I’m a reading robot.’ But it’s really not that way. It’s for reading on the go.”Spritz is setting out to revolutionize the way we read on mobile devices. It displays words in bursts, so readers can quickly understand each one while whipping through the mass of text piling up on our tablets and smartphones.The technology is expected to have its first major public debut on the next-generation Galaxy smartphone and smartwatches that Samsung is scheduled to release in April.Since its launch last month, Spritz has opened eyes around the Web and was even featured on the “Today” show. Fans have taken to Twitter to profess they will read only with Spritz from now on. Others, though, question whether Spritz really works, or that it is necessary for people to read so fast.“At what cost is speed?” asked Maryanne Wolf, director of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University. “I question the very assumption that speed is better.”‘I don’t know how long you can do it before you’d be exhausted. If you had to blink or rub your eyes you might miss 20 or 30 words.’The science behind Spritz isn’t new, but it has been retooled and optimized for a digital era. Most people find a reading speed of around 200 words per minute comfortable, whether on paper or online. Spritz users can set their optimal reading speed, starting at 250 words a minute.Spritz, though, is based on a theory that the mind can recognize a word when the eye sees a particular part of it. That portion of the word is called the “optimal recognition point.” When the eye spots it, the brain processes the word. And then moves onto the next word. And the next, and next, and so on.The trick behind Spritz is to highlight every word’s optimal recognition point in red. The red letter in every word is placed in the same spot on the Spritz reader. That way, the eye doesn’t wander and lose track, or work extra to get back on target.“If the brain doesn’t have to move the eye, you can better focus on what you’re reading,” Waldman said. “If you only have one word at a time, your eye really can’t go anywhere.”That, Waldman said, is how the mind can make sense out of what would otherwise be a dizzying stream of words. With the eye fixed on one position and words flashing by, Spritz claims, many readers can learn to read 1,000 words per minute — or more.That is, if you can stand it.“I don’t know how long you can do it before you’d be exhausted,” said Mark Rosenfield, a professor at the State University of New York College of Optometry who has studied the effects of digital reading on the eyes.With Spritz, he said, “If you had to blink or rub your eyes you might miss 20 or 30 words.”In general, all our staring at screens is taking a toll. In a study published in 2012, Rosenfield found that 40 percent of office workers have tired eyes during the workday as a result of looking at computer screens. It’s so common it has a name: computer vision syndrome.Rosenfield worries Spritz might only make matters worse. One reason: Readers may focus so intently on the Spritz reader they forget to blink. And not blinking enough can lead to more eye fatigue.
Technologists have been trying to figure out new ways of delivering text on mobile devices for more than a decade. Tablet makers are still tinkering with background lighting and resolutions. App developers are constantly working up new designs for better ways to digest content.While computers are incredibly sophisticated, the way people interact with them is still far from perfect, said Chris Harrison, assistant professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.Spritz represents something of an evolution in the field, especially when it’s applied to a screen as small as one on a wristwatch, Harrison said.“They’ve done it at a time when smartwatches have become interesting for the first time,” Harrison said. “Clearly, you’re not going to fit a Web page or an e-book on your wrist.”A similar approach was tried over a decade ago, with underwhelming results. In a 2002 study, researchers tested a method known as rapid serial visual presentation that, similar to Spritz, displayed one word at a time on a computer.  They concluded that the subjects of the study did not like the quick presentation of text.Ironically, the device that researchers used to test the method did not survive, either. It was a PalmPilot, the precursor to today’s smartphones. To be sure, the text on the early PalmPilot wasn’t as elegant as words that appear on today’s high-resolution iPhones, and there simply wasn’t the same flood of information.The Spritz technology was originally developed by Waldman’s business partner, German scientist and entrepreneur Maik Maurer, so that he could more quickly read articles.The two met through previous business dealings and Maurer reached out to Waldman, a seasoned entrepreneur, to help commercialize his technology.Spritz is Waldman’s fifth startup.
When the two began working together full time on Spritz in 2012, they weren’t sure it would take off right away. Now they’re surprised by the attention that followed Waldman’s trip to Spain in February to launch Spritz at the Mobile World Congress, one of the industry’s largest conventions.In the hours and days after his presentations, Spritz received such an onslaught of attention that the company had to boost the capacity of its Internet servers by eight times. It also drew the interest of Irish telecom billionaire Denis O’Brien, who obtained a minority stake in Spritz for an undisclosed sum. So far, the company has raised about $4 million.Waldman and Maurer had been in talks with several tech companies about using Spritz, but so far Samsung is the first to incorporate it in its products. The world’s biggest seller of smartphones is expected to offer Spritz as part of its e-mail apps on the upcoming Galaxy products, including its wearable smartwatch.Samsung declined to comment.While the Samsung deal will expose Spritz to millions of potential users, even Waldman acknowledges Spritz isn’t for everyone, or for every text.But Thad Starner, a professor of computing at Georgia Tech and an early pioneer in mobile technologies, said this method of reading e-mail or texts could grow on readers as the devices we use — and wear — get increasingly smaller.“Until you try it,” Starner said, “you don’t get why it matters.”© 2018 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC"	Science
613	By Alan Ng  - Mar 9, 2014Are you willing to switch to a Spritz reading app once the text streaming technology is fully integrated into the market? We’ve told you about the Spritz iPhone demand so far, but now we want to talk about the potential benefits that Spritz can bring to those with reading difficulties.Everyone is talking about how Spritz can make you read faster, but what about Spritz actually being able to help those with reading difficulties, read better?Spritz’s text streaming technology is now starting to become a very popular talking point among interested consumers and now we believe that the service could also be very influential in helping those who would usually have problems reading in the traditional manner.If you are someone who suffers from eye muscle coordination problems, we invite you to take the ‘Spritz test’ once again in our previous article here. See how you get on with reading the Spritz text – now of course with the added benefit of not having to track so many words with your eyes at once and more importantly – having your eyes on a fixed location as well.Spritz running at 500 words per minuteSpritz could actually serve as a professional service to firstly help those with reading difficulties read the content they want with less stress and secondly – help to strengthen the eyes as a general incentive as well.If you suffer from reading difficulties and want to read into the more technical side of how Spritz works, you should definitely visit ‘The Science‘ over at Spritz’s website to get a better idea.Let us know what you think about Spritz reading so far and whether you agree that it could be a great new tool for those with reading difficulties.Follow us on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus.Also See: Spritz iPhone app demand after demo	Science

A reading app that claims to enable its users to read up to 1,000 words per minute has attracted a lot of attention, but how does it work? We explain what Spritz is, and how it gets its users reading fast.It's not surprising that an app that claims to enable its users to read at 1,000 words per minute has attracted a lot of attention - especially when we tell you that the human average for reading English text is a lowly 220 words per minute. Here's what is the Spritz reading app. We go into a little detail as to how the Spritz app works. See also what's the best smartphone?First of all you should know that the Spritz reading app has initially been confirmed to appear only on Samsung devices. So if you want to use the Spritz technology then you had better buy the Samsung Galaxy S5 or Samsung Galaxy Gear2 smartwatch as these are the only two devices announced so far that run the app.However, Sprtiz' CEO Frank Waldman,revealed at MWC that he was in talks with the likes of Google, Yahoo and Amazon, discussing how his reading software could improve theses company's products. So watch this space.In its simplest form Sprtiz is an app for the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Samsung Galaxy Gear2 smartwatch that lets you read quicker than you normally would by showing you one word at a time.Here are three examples of how Spritz works.


 Spritz at 250 words per minute.


 Spritz at 350 words per minute


 Spritz at 500 words per minuteWhile there are currently other apps on the market that claim to enable you to read faster, Spritz is a little different.The reason that Waldman gives for Spritz being different to its competition is thanks to what the company describes as Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. What this means in layman's terms is that the Spritz app puts a lot of emphasis on the positioning of each word, with the recommended 'focus letter' highlighted to give the reader the best chance of processing and understanding each word.The science doesn't stop there either, Waldman also claims that Spritz has an incredible algorithm built into the app that decides how long each word should stay displayed on screen for too.There is no official release date for the Spritz app on other devices as yet, but considering the amount of attention that the app has already received even though it hasn't launched yet, it would be madness for the German tech company not to strike/blitzkrieg while the iron is hot.Spritz's CEO Frank Waldman said that the company wanted to follow the Whatsapp business model, which means it will offer the speedy reading app to users for free for a limited time to build a following and get users used to the software, and then start charging a small fee for the app further down the line.According to the Spritz website, then ""of course"". Early test from the developers suggests that reading retention while using Spritz is equal to that of traditional left to right reading. The company also claims that with a little bit of experience you will soon remember more of the text than you did before. Spritz also claim that you can read at this ridiculously quick speed for up to two hours without a break providing your bladder is strong enough.Take a look at the Sprtiz blog to find out more.

616	 TechFragmentsIf you feel like you can’t read text on your smartphone quick enough, help is on the way. Spritz is a new app developed by an MIT entrepreneur and two scientists at the Technical University of Munich. It has the goal of reinventing reading on mobile and wearable devices by streaming individual words using an “Optimal Recognition Point” (ORP) in a special display called the “Redicle.”The method claims to make communication faster and more effective by doing away with the inefficient eye movements associated with traditional reading.The first implementation of Spritz will be an email application for the Samsung Gear 2 smartwatch and Galaxy S5 smartphone. Spritz’s patent-pending technology will enable Samsung device users to read emails comfortably and conveniently- one streaming word at a time.Designed for small screens, Spritz ensures there will be no more scrolling, swiping, squinting and pinching to read on your devices. Instead, you will see streaming individual words, one by one, at the your desired speed.Developed and tested for over three years with roots in science and data, Spritz is supposed to let the brain focus on each word, thereby promoting faster reading speeds and higher information retention rates.“We’re reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices,” said CEO Frank Waldman. “As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently. Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device – the options are almost limitless. Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.”Since our eye can only focus on about 13 characters at a time, the app uses 13 characters’ worth of display space.By streaming individual words inside of a special display Spritz calls the “Redicle,” the app helps the eyes position themselves precisely at the recognition point for each word. The word Redicle presumably stems from the inclusion of one red letter in each word, which is used to anchor the eye.I never realized this, but the most time-consuming part of reading is actually the eye movement from word to word. Only around 20% of your time is spent processing content. Spritz takes eye movement out of the act of reading, so much more can be read in the same amount of time.So far, so good. But can our brains keep up with a constant input of text?“When we started testing, we already knew that we were on to something but the comprehension tests surprised even us,” said Dr. Maik Maurer, Co-Founder and CTO of Spritz. “Happily, our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension. We’re now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user’s traditional reading speed and comprehension, an effect reported to us by many of our testers.”Currently, Spritz supports English, Spanish, French, German, Russian and Korean. More languages are on the way. Multiple reading speeds range from 100 to 1000 words per minute.Some of the other applications currently being worked on by the company include SMS Messages/Texts/Messaging Clients, Embedded Media, Closed Captioning, E-Readers, Head Mounted Displays (Google Glass, anyone) and Social Media.For more information , visit www.spritzinc.comPrevious Post: Blackberry Cedes 3rd Place to Windows Phone in U.S.Next Post: Bimetallic Nanoparticles grown with Atomic Layer DepositionRecent Posts	Science
617	Tuesday, Feb 13, 2018 | Last Update : 02:04 AM ISTSpritz app enables individuals to read lengthy online content much faster, by displaying content, using one word at time.This app eliminates the clunky page, and shows only a window of 13 characters. It displays only a limited number of characters because the human eye focuses on only 13 characters at a time. In-depth research states that traditional reading formats take up a lot of physical screen space on mobile devices like smartphones. Taking this fact into consideration, it displays words with the Optimal Recognition Point (ORP).The ORP utilizes the brain's processing time, and is indicated by a colored letter in the word, helping the user to read quickly. Its technique can increase reading speeds to 1,000 words or more a minute, compared to a normal 220.To encourage developers, the company will also offer SDKs and APIs for Android, iOS and JavaScript, in order to  incorporate it inside apps and websites. 	Science

620	"An app called Spritz will let people read up to 1,000 words-per-minute, which translates to being able to read an entire novel in just over an hour.Ever wanted to blaze through your novels and textbooks but find that you can't since you can only read at a certain rate? Well, a new app called Spritz just might help with that. According to the company, Spritz will help people read 250 to 1,000 words-per-minute, which equates to reading an entire Harry Potter novel at just over an hour. The Boston-based company states, ""Reading is inherently time consuming because your eyes have to move from word to word and line to line. Traditional reading also consumes huge amounts of physical space on a page or screen, which limits reading effectiveness on small displays. Scrolling, pinching, and resizing a reading area doesn't fix the problem and only frustrates people. Now, with compact text streaming from Spritz, content can be streamed one word at a time, without forcing your eyes to spend time moving around the page. Spritz makes streaming your content easy and more comfortable, especially on small displays. Our ""Redicle"" technology enhances readability even more by using horizontal lines and hash marks to direct your eyes to the red letter in each word, so you can focus on the content that interests you.""Spritz Inc. claims its tech can be integrated into photos, maps and websites, too. And while we know how traditional ways of reading can be time consuming, just how does the Spritz make us read faster? ""The time consuming part of reading lies mainly in the actual eye movements from word to word and sentence to sentence. In addition, traditional reading simply takes up a lot of physical space. Spritz solves both of these problems. First, your eyes do not have to move from word to word or around the page that you're reading. In fact, there's no longer a page - with Spritz you only need 13 total characters to show all of your content. Fast streaming of text is easier and more comfortable for the reader, especially when reading areas become smaller,"" the company claims.For reference, a .gif showing what 500 words-per-minute looks like can be seen below, with 1,000 words-per-minute speeds doubling that of what's shown.While using the app might make people read faster, that doesn't necessarily mean they'll understand all the words flashing on screen. But according to a statement from Dr. Maik Mauer, co-founder and CTO of Spritz, ""spritzing"" does increase a person's comprehension. ""Happily, our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension. We're now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user's traditional reading speed and comprehension, an effect reported to us by many of our testers,"" Mauer notes.Currently, the speed-reading app is set to launch on the upcoming Samsung S5 smartphone and Gear 2 smartwatch; but the company states they are working with other mobile makers, wearable manufacturers and even e-book companies to make the technology more accessible in the future. You can test the app on its official site to see if it works just as the company intended, or you can also check out the open-source implementation or even the Chrome extension that's available.Personally, I'm all for making people read faster. Hopefully, continually using the app won't make anyone feel dizzy or even nauseous. Can you imagine ""spritzing"" instead of reading or would you rather take your time when reading something?Source: PCMag and NeoGAFServed from: 192.168.10.91 | Version: com"	Science

The time spent reading could soon be dramatically reduced with the help of new technology that enables you to read faster.Spritz is a revolutionary new solution due to come pre-installed on Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Gear 2 smartwatch.The technology works by presenting words on the screen one-by-one in rapid succession, ranging from speeds of 250 words per minute to as high as 1,000 words - nearly five times the normal reading speed of 220 words a minute.Spritz is designed for smaller screens, to enable quick reading of emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content without the need to scroll.The start-up claims that eye movement from word to word is the most time-consuming part of reading, taking 80% of our time.However, its text-streaming technology removes the hard work for you, giving more time to process the content.""With compact text streaming from Spritz, content can be streamed one word at a time, without forcing your eyes to spend time moving around the page,"" the company says on its website.Spritz currently supports English, Spanish, French, German, Russian and Korean, with more languages due to launch in the future.PREVIOUS ARTICLENEXT ARTICLE

	Imagine reading an entire book in an hour — without skipping one word.
	That’s the future, according to experts at Spritz, a Boston-based digital startup that introduced a new technology to allow the average reader to speed through text at a superhuman rate.
	“It’s a very simple concept,” Spritz CEO Frank Waldman told the Daily News. “We position each word in a display where your eye can recognize the word without moving. Every word has what’s called a recognition point, the place where your eye looks to recognize the word.”
	By focusing only on that point, users can breeze through words blinking in rapid succession across a screen, rather than scanning a string of words across a page.
	“You can read without moving your eyes,” he said.
	The company claims only 20% of the time people spend reading is actually processing content. The rest is spent darting your eyes across the page or screen.
	“Spritzers” can read up to 1,000 words per minute, fast enough to finish the first “Harry Potter” book in about an hour and fifteen minutes, but Waldman says the average user will reach around 450 words per minute.
	Spritzing will first be available on the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Gear 2 this spring, and the company is working with other brands to launch more smartphone apps.
	Waldman — who expects at least 1 billion people will be spritzing in the future — also hopes websites utilize the new technology.
	“Especially mobile sites,” he said. “You can compact everything and read lots of information without having to scroll and swipe and do all those things.”

623	"A new technology that is set to make its debut in April could one day make it possible for users to read Harry Potter books in just a few hours.Spritz, as the technology is called, makes it easy for users to read as quickly as 1,000 words per minute by focusing users' eyes on a single word at a time. The company says its technology places each word at the optimal location on the screen, ensuring users can rapidly recognize them.""This method makes communication faster, easier and more effective by removing the inefficient eye movements associated with traditional reading,"" Spritz said in a statement.VIDEO: How Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto chose which reporter to speak to [Video]According to the company, with traditional reading, users spend 80% of their time simply moving their eyes and only 20% actually processing content.A demo of Spritz's technology can be found on the company's website.Spritz is set to launch in April as a feature with the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone and the Gear 2 smartwatch.""With the growth of wearable devices, Spritz's patent-pending technology will enable Samsung device users to read emails comfortably and conveniently -- one streaming word at a time,"" the company said in a statement.Spritz said it is working on enabling its technology so it can also be used to read text messages, social media streams, web content and digital books.At 1,000 words per minute, users could potentially read the shortest Harry Potter book -- ""The Sorcerer's Stone,"" which is about 77,000 words long -- in a little more than an hour. The longest book -- ""The Order of the Phoenix,"" which is about 257,000 words long -- could be read in a little more than four hours.However, Spritz said it has not yet decided when its technology will be made available for e-books.For those wondering if it is possible to remember the things they read using Spritz, the company said that its tests have shown that retention levels with Spritz are at least as good as they are with traditional reading techniques.ALSO:Instagram inks $100-million advertising dealWhy Thursday may have been the strangest bitcoin news day everDonors pledge bitcoins to Dorian S.

First, let me try to make sense of the ""science"" behind speed-reading.Usually, we read books word for word, line for line. I just recently learned that for each word, the eye seeks a certain point called the ""Optimal Recognition Point."" Once you find this point, you recognize the word and realize its meaning. That is reading: word by word, meaning by meaning, and voilà, story line!So here's the deal with Spritz: Spritz takes a book, takes a word from that book and adds a single red letter to each word. The red letter is the ORP. Then, Spritz presents all of the ORPs at the same space on the screen. In this way, our eyes don't move at all as we see the words. In theory, we process the information instantaneously rather than spend time decoding each word.Of course, I experimented. On the Spritz website, you can try the program from 250 words per minute up to 600. (I get dizzy at about 550.) The idea works. I had no trouble following the rapidly flashing words with their oh-so-important ORPs. Yet, here is the concern: When speed-reading, how much do you, the reader, really retain?Part of my job is reviewing books, and before I decide to do a write-up, I skim. I skim for language quality, quippy dialogue and beautiful descriptions — but in skimming, do I really ""get"" the message? No, of course not. To fully immerse myself in a book, I need to sit down, slow down and focus. The question is: does Spritz steal that experience from me?Why are we in such a rush to finish books anyway? I guess I understand the use of Spritz for things like boring office notices or the latest state legislature. But a big part of reading is escapism. We read books to visit different places and meet people we may never have met before. Why rush it?Yes, I read fast — really fast — but not 600 words per minute! And I don't read to show off; I read because I love to read. I'm worried that Spritz is making reading into a contest. (""Guess how many words I got through today!"") I think Spritz has its place in the business world, but I fear it may distort our more literary aspirations. Don't believe me?

Practical IT insight from Tony Bradley Use commas to separate multiple email addressesYour message has been sent.There was an error emailing this page.
Between email, Web pages, books and other texts, we each read thousands of words a day. A company called Spritz has spent the last few years in stealth mode, developing a technology to help us read even more, in less time.

Spritz—which is both the name of the technology and the verb for using it—streams text on your screen one word at a time, which, the company claims, allows your brain to comprehend it much more quickly and easily. Their trademarked tagline is “Reading Reimagined,” and after playing with the technology a bit I have to agree.

Spritz technology enables you to read and comprehend information much faster than normal.

Spritz relies on something the company has dubbed the Optimal Recognition Point (ORP). Spritz claims your brain processes the information it's taking in once your eyes reach the ORP of a given word, and it’s trained to process the data as a complete, coherent thought once it reaches punctuation.

According to Spritz, 80 percent of the time you spend reading is devoted to physically moving your eyes from one word to the next in search of the ORP, while only 20 percent is spent actually processing the information. To speed things up, Spritz reformats the text and aligns it based on the ORP so there is essentially no physical eye movement, and almost all of your time is spent taking in data.

The Spritz Web page explains what makes Spritz different from other speed reading systems: “There are lots of other reading techniques out there such as skimming (not reading every word), avoiding sub-vocalization (talking to yourself while reading) and enlarging the peripheral span (reading an entire page at a time by mental “snapshot”) that attempt to increase reading speeds. While these methods can be effective, achieving significant improvement requires intensive, continuous training and dedication. By contrast, spritzing can be learned in less than 5 minutes and, if you don’t spritz for a month, no practice is needed to return quickly to your previous speed or skill-level.”

I am a more voracious reader than most—but not voracious enough to keep up with the pace at which I buy new books. I have tried different traditional speed reading programs over the years with limited success. Spritz seems to work for me.

I wouldn’t necessarily want to read fiction using Spritz. When I read a Dan Brown novel, or The Hunger Games, I want to take in the nuance of the dialogue. I want to give my brain time to imagine the scene being described, and I want to use sub-vocalization to “hear” the different character voices in my head.

For other texts, however, Spritz would be helpful. Imagine how much more productive you'd be if you could get through all your email in a fifth of the time it normally takes you. I would love to see Amazon partner with Spritz—or just buy it outright—and incorporate the technology as an option when reading a Kindle book.

I can’t wait to take advantage of Spritz, but sadly I’ll have to. Spritz will be pre-installed on the new Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Galaxy Gear 2 smartwatch, but as of right now it’s not available any other way. Hopefully it will soon be incorporated into iOS, or at least into iOS apps.

If you want to test out Spritz for yourself, visit the Spritz website. At the upper right there is a button labeled “click to spritz,” which brings up a box displaying text using Spritz technology. There is a dropdown box at the bottom right that allows you to select how fast, in words per minute, the text zooms by.

Try it out. I think you’ll be amazed at how much more effectively and efficiently you can read.

626	Spritz, a program for Samsung devices, claims it can help one read 1,000 words per minute.It works by showing you a word at a time and it displays the words in a fast timeframe. The words then speed up faster and one has to try and get the meaning faster.The highest setting is 1,000 words per minute, but reviews say that looking at around 500 words per minute is mind-boggling. Around 250 words per minute is fine.It also positions the words around central letters, meaning they’re easier to read.According to Time, Spritz can allow one to read “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” in 77, while The Bible takes about 13 hours at 1,000 words.Spritz developers say they spent around three years developing the technology that makes it work. And they told Discovery it can be learned in about five minutes.As of late February, around a million people downloaded it, the company says.“Reading is inherently time consuming because your eyes have to move from word to word and line to line. Traditional reading also consumes huge amounts of physical space on a page or screen, which limits reading effectiveness on small displays. Scrolling, pinching, and resizing a reading area doesn’t fix the problem and only frustrates people,” the developers say its website.It adds: “Now, with compact text streaming from Spritz, content can be streamed one word at a time, without forcing your eyes to spend time moving around the page. Spritz makes streaming your content easy and more comfortable, especially on small displays.”“Our ‘Redicle’ technology enhances readability even more by using horizontal lines and hash marks to direct your eyes to the red letter in each word, so you can focus on the content that interests you. Best of all, Spritz’s patent-pending technology can integrate into photos, maps, videos, and websites to promote more effective communication,” it says.Elite Daily posted video of the technology in motion.

628	"TrendingA Boston-based startup company called Spritz has spent the last three years developing a text streaming technology that could help users double their reading speed and read between 250 to 1000 words per minute. Just imagine — you’ll be the star of your book club!We all want to be able to read faster — after all, the more you read, the smarter you get! So naturally we were thrilled to hear that there’s a new technology that could help us do just that. So how does it work?






[hl_ndn videoid=”25668286″]
[hl_ndn videoid=”25644736″]According to Spritz, we spend as little as 20 percent of our reading time actually taking in the words on the page. That’s partially because it takes time for our eyes to move from word to word. The technology aims to fix that by eliminating “the inconvenience of scrolling, swiping, squinting and pinching to read on your devices by streaming individual words, one by one, at the user’s desired speed,” according to Spritz.Spritz has been tested and found to help new users double their reading speed in minutes.“When we started testing, we already knew that we were on to something but the comprehension tests surprised even us,” Dr. Maik Maurer, co-founder and CTO of Spritz, said in a statement, according to PC magazine. “Happily, our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension. We’re now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user’s traditional reading speed and comprehension, an effect reported to us by many of our testers.”The Spritz app will be available exclusively on the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone and Gear 2 smartwatch. But you can also test your skills on Spritz’s website.So HollywoodLifers, are you going to give Spritz a try? Let us know!— Tierney McAfee"	Science
629	"Technology that lets you read much faster than usual is looking for smartwatch, smartphone and tablet vendors to partner with.Spritz, text streaming technology that can be integrated onto mobile devices, wearables, apps, websites and more, is compatible with Samsung&apos;s Gear 2 smartwatch and the S5 smartphone. It claims to improve reading speed up to a whopping 1,000 words per minute.If (like us) you&apos;re a little skeptical, you can try out the tech on the Spritz website and test out speeds from 250 words per minute to 600 words per minute. Spritz claims to work with emails, text messages, embedded media, closed captioning, digital books, smartwatches, mobile phones, e-readers and wearable head-mounted displays. It&apos;s also working on getting it ready for social media websites like Twitter and Facebook, and says it could also be used for outdoor ads in the future.It&apos;s looking to partner with tech vendors, developers and other businesses to integrate Spritz into products in the future.The firm says the tech could improve users&apos; regular reading speeds, and was designed to be simple and easy to learn immediately.""Within 5 minutes, generally, you should be able to pick it up,"" said the company in a statement.So how does it work? ""Most people’s focal distance (the amount of horizontal distance on a page that people can see when reading) is right around 13 characters using standard font sizes,"" Spritz added. ""When your eye recognises a word longer than that, it naturally jumps to the right of those first 13 characters while processing the first part of the word as it jumps. In reality, a long word requires your eye to break it into multiple pieces and that is how your brain stores it.

633	"Have you heard about Spritz? The Boston-based startup found celebrity this week in a series of news stories about its new speed-reading app. In an effort to make communication ""faster, easier, and more effective,"" Spritz created a tool that shows readers words one by one. It relies on a concept called ""rapid serial visual presentation"" and in essence trains your eyes to read faster - up to 500 words per minute or more, which is double the average reading speed. At that rate you could read a novel in about two hours.Spritz just launched and will only be available for Samsung devices to start, but the company hopes to expand its reach and application, from email to social media and ebooks. Take a look:The emergence of a tool like this doesn't herald a digital reading revolution. In fact, another announcement came this week that turns the idea of digital speed-reading on its head. Digital Book World ran a post on another reading app, this one focused on helping consumers read more fiction by making ebooks available to them slowly, in manageable chunks over time. For $4.99 a month, Rooster will curate a contemporary book and a work of classic literature and deliver them in daily installments, straight to your phone. The app is currently available for iPhones but by invitation only, so if you're interested be sure to get your name on the list.What can we take away from the simultaneous arrival of two very different services built on a foundation of digital books? The answer isn't in the premise, but in the medium. Our world has reached its ""mobile moment."" Mobile subscriptions have surpassed the population of the planet, with over one billion in China alone. There are three times as many mobile devices on earth as there are computers. By the end of next year we'll have downloaded half a trillion apps. It doesn't matter if they hope to help us with reading or shopping or paying our bills: mobile is the medium to which service companies must cater from here on in.So if you're open to a different kind of on-the-go reading experience, the only question now is: would you like your stories fast, or slow?Filed under:

634	Technology’s changed the way we do almost everything. But whether you buy an ebook or read an article on the web, the format of reading itself is rooted in centuries-old, left-to-right, boring ol’ text. As methods for consuming music, television and games have shifted drastically, the way we read might also head down a new path. The software is called Spritz, a tool developed for Samsung’s Galaxy S5 and Gear2 smartwatch. Spritz streams words individually rather than forcing your eyes to read horizontal rows of text. It works by using a red letter to pinpoint the eye’s “Optimal Recognition Point,” or the point where the eye can most easily recognize a word. From here, you can stream (and comprehend) words much faster than you’d imagine.“As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently,” said Frank Waldman, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Spritz. “Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device—the options are almost limitless.”Give the technology a try at Spritz’s website. You can practice at up to 600 words per minute on the Spritz site (a press release says the system will support up to 1,000 w.p.m.). While we’re not sure what it would be like to actually read a novel at these speeds, the possibility of eventually completing a work like Infinite Jest in almost one work day is pretty exciting.© 2018 Paste Media Group.

635	"Start reading. (Amy Allcock)
Start reading. (Amy Allcock)Follow @calebgarling“Once you get used to it, the words just flow into your brain,” says Frank Waldman, the CEO of Spritz. He’s convincing me that the company’s attempt at a speed reading tool will fundamentally alter the way our eyeballs consume sentences. “The faster it goes, the more focused you are.”Rather than bouncing along a line of text, the Spritz reader rapidly blinks each word in a fixed location. The company claims 80 percent of your reading time is “wasted” with saccades — the movement of the eye to a new point, like from word to word on a line of text — and only 20 percent is actually spent processing the word. By allowing the eye to focus in one spot, the process streamlines and we consume more.Spritz came out of stealth mode at last week’s Mobile World Congress after three years of secrecy. Only time will tell if the startup succeeds, but in the meantime its tweak on reading brings up interesting questions about the way we consume content.The normal range for reading is 200-250 words per minute. I tried Spritz for a bit and cranked the speed to 600 words per minute and surprisingly, it wasn’t hard to keep up (though that felt like about the max). It doesn’t feel like reading words, it’s like being injected with them. The experience is closer to the sci-fi, Singularity idea that our nerve endings are nothing but inputs.Here, try this story:Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), the name for the principle behind a lot of speed reading tools, has been around for decades and there’s a cottage industry of speed reading apps and software. QuickReader has a well-review iOS app. Matt Bischoff had used speed reading techniques to study for exams in college but later wrote the iOS Velocity app, which speed sentences them along a line (so you can’t slow down). Since Spritz’s news he says Velocity has seen a boost in downloads because Spritz itself doesn’t offer an app (right now it’s trying to license the tech).“I’m excited more [companies] are getting into this field,” Bischoff says. “I don’t think a lot of people know about these techniques.”When using Spritz, one letter in each word appears in red. That letter is what the company calls the “optimal recognition point” of the word — the place your eye lands to interpret the rest of the word. We don’t take in each letter as we read. We absorb the whole thing. That’s why you can read msispeled wrods lkie tehse, a playful concept known as “typoglycemia.” (It’s unclear why a lack of sugar should factor into that portmanteau.) So with the eye trained on the most important region of the word, the next step is removing the gaps.Now, this takes the romanticism out of a lot of reading. When reading a novel, those saccades are the micro-moments when readers can imagine characters, landscapes or questions of the plot. With Spritz, it’s like holding on for life as a firehose of information unleashes into your eyeballs.And Waldman doesn’t have any illusions otherwise. “This isn’t for reading literature,” he says. “It’s for information.”For a lot of reading — news, work e-mails, etc — the message is a basic transfer of relatively simple facts. E-mail and industry news are an important part of many professions, but their time-consuming consumption can eat into more productive parts of the day. In those cases, I’d vouch for Spritz. (Though I do not vouch for the company’s attempt to make “spritz” a new verb — no, you weren’t “spritzing” an article, you were reading it.)Spritz wants to harness the recent push for small screened devices, like smartwatches. Gadget makers like Pebble and Samsung have their versions and other heavyweights like Apple are rumored to be working on their own. An entire news story can’t fit on that screen — but a Spritz firehose would be about right.The type of consumption Spritz offers might not be good thing for news organizations. If their text can be distilled into that firehose, they might lose the ability to present advertisements, much as it already happens with read-later apps like Evernote or Readability. An app that scraped news pages and presented the information in Spritz firehose fashion would not be hard to build.And that brings up a tough question for Spritz: if this reading methodology caught on, couldn’t Samsung, Apple and other device makers just make such firehose interface themselves? To prevent this, Waldman says they won’t charge OEMs to license Spritz and that the company also has stocked up on patents. But already there are opensource versions of such a reader.No matter the speed, information always has a way of getting free.Follow @calebgarling"	Science
636	"If you haven't heard of Spritz yet, don't panic. The software is only being released on Samsung devices, so Jay Z and Ellen are covered, but the rest of humanity is going to have to wait a while. Spritz is a Boston-based company that has developed speed-reading software that will allow your brain to process an avalanche of text in a minimal amount of time.Basically, there's a text bar like you'd find in a message thread or data entry point on your smartphone. Spritz inputs the material you're reading into the bar one word at a time, aligning the words differently and highlighting a letter in red to help your mind recognize it quicker. In doing so, it eliminates all of the empty space your eyes digest while reading.At the fastest setting (1,000 words per minute), you could read an entire Harry Potter book in just over an hour. If you don't believe it's effective, cruise on over to Spritzinc.com and give it a try on their website.The time consuming part of reading lies mainly in the actual eye movements from word to word and sentence to sentence. In addition, traditional reading simply takes up a lot of physical space. Spritz solves both of these problems. First, your eyes do not have to move from word to word or around the page that you’re reading. In fact, there’s no longer a page – with Spritz you only need 13 total characters to show all of your content. Fast streaming of text is easier and more comfortable for the reader, especially when reading areas become smaller. Spritz’s patent-pending technology can also be integrated into photos, maps, videos, and websites for more effective communication.Click here to watch the video.

637	"What can reading 1,000 words a minute do for you? A speed-reading technology called Spritz aims at letting you find out.The product, which will come installed on Samsung's Gear 2 smartwatch and Galaxy S5 smartphone when they launch, streams the material the user is reading one word at a time onto a text bar on the device's screen, philly.com reports.One letter in each word is highlighted in red at what developer Spritz Inc. says is the ""optimal recognition point,"" the spot where the brain recognizes the word, according to the International Business Times. Every word is positioned so that its red letter is in the same place as those before and after, so the eyes don't have to move.The words stream in rapid succession, up to 1,000 words a minute, nearly five times as fast as the normal reading speed of 220 words a minute. That's fast enough to get through a Harry Potter book in an hour, philly.com notes.At Spritz's top speed, a reader could zip through the Declaration of Independence -- 1,478 words including signatures -- in under a minute and a half. The 560,000-word English translation of ""War and Peace"" could be devoured in under 10 hours and the Bible, at about 775,000 words, in under 13 hours.The U.S Tax Code, all 4 million or so words of it, could be read in two days and 18 hours.Walt Wolf posted this video demonstration of Spritz on YouTube:
 Various Spritzing speeds up to 600 words per minute also are demonstrated on Spritz Inc.'s website.Alison Flood, writing in The Guardian's Books Blog, said she found she could comfortably keep up at 600 words a minute.""Spritzing is quite fun, and it seems to work,"" Flood added. ""But the issue for me, which I think would stop me using it to read books, is the level of concentration it requires. You can't look away from the screen for a second, or you'd be utterly at sea.""Spritz Chief Executive Officer Frank Waldman told Business Insider's Ryan Bushey that he sees applications for the technology extending into social media:
Waldman divulged that his company has been pitching Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and other tech giants on how Spritz could improve various products. He wouldn't provide specific details, but explained how Spritz could hypothetically alter services like Facebook or Twitter. Long threads of tweets or detailed Facebook statuses could be read in a few seconds, for example.The company is taking submissions for Android, iPhone, and Web developers kits, Business Insider said. Initially offered for email and messaging, the company also is working on licensing Spritz to  software developers and ebook makers.Spritz officials haven't decided whether Spritz would be a paid offering or free, Waldman said.What's your take on this speed-reading technology?

638	"How fast can you read? Not as fast as you could, according to Spritz.
	A new app called Spritz that claims to offer a way to speed-read entire novels at a massively faster pace than normal, but without the kind of loss in comprehension that usually comes from skimming. It works by laying text out word-by-word, aligned in such a way that you don’t have to move your eyes when you read.

	Here's what happens at 250 words per minute, which is at the top end of average for most people when it comes to reading speed:


                                          googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""Unit6""); });
                                        





	And here's 500wpm:




                                        googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""1x3""); });
                                      



	Clearly, it works. According to its creators, Spritz has been in development for almost three years, and it based on “research” that states 80 per cent of the time a person spends reading is taken up by the eyes moving and focusing on each new word. Cut that out, and you attain a huge boost in reading speed.

	The red letter in each word reflects what Spritz calls the optimal recognition point (ORP) – that's the bit of the word where the eye needs to focus to be able to grasp the overall shape and meaning of the word around it:

		Spritzing presents reading content with the ORP located at the specific place where you’re already looking, allowing you to read without having to move your eyes. With this approach, reading becomes more efficient because Spritzing increases the time your brain spends processing content without having to waste time searching for the next word’s ORP. Spritzing also enhances reading on small screens. Because the human eye can focus on about 13 characters at a time, Spritzing requires only 13 characters’ worth of space inside our redicle. No other reading method is designed to help you read all of your content when you’re away from a large screen.”


	The key selling point for Spritz is actually not in speed, but in comprehension. Speed reading techniques, historically, were developed without the use of technology – they're for reading paper books, after all – and relied upon learning how to take in whole sentences, then whole paragraphs, and then, for the very best, whole pages. It's a case of pattern recognition, and can lead to incredibly rapid reading paces even if there is also, inevitably, a loss of comprehension. Studies have found that scoring greater then 50 per cent on a speed reading comprehension test is exceptional, not the norm.


                                        googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""1x2""); });
                                      



	Spritz, instead, relies on some visual stimuli research from the 1970s, on what's known as rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). It was developed as part of a study into how well participants could identify targets among a group of objects, flashed quickly on a screen; over time, further research revealed that RSVP made a good basis for a speed reading technique, with as much as a 33 per cent improvement in reading speed without any effect on comprehension. Spritz's novelty is the ORP, and aligning all words along that line to make all eye movement redundant. That's how they can claim that people can, unlike with those other speed reading techniques, reach as fast as 1000wpm with barely any training.

	So let’s say you’re really into what Spritz is selling, and want to start getting through War & Peace in less time than it takes to watch a full season of Breaking Bad. The practical limitations of reading text one word at a time should be obvious: shorter words are going to be easier to understand than longer ones, and Tolstoy’s epic is going to be more taxing to grasp word-by-word than, say, Harry Potter. Anything with weird formatting, footnotes or sentences that can last longer than the length of a page – here's looking at you, Infinite Jest – are going to be made incomprehensible with Spritz. There's a button to go back to the start of either the paragraph or sentence that the reader is on, but for texts that require multiple passes to fully grasp (like, say, a scientific study) Spritz is going to be a hindrance, not a help.

	That said, most people don't read those kinds of texts. Authors might be tempted to bemoan a change to the way that readers take in text, but for many people the ability to crunch down an email from a colleague, or their Twitter feed, in bursts like this will actually be pretty useful. The main usage that Spritz is touting is on devices, like smartwatches, that will be showing text designed for larger screens. Grokking a news story on a two-inch screen does seem like an obvious application for a speed reader app like Spritz, so it's going to be interesting to see if developers try to integrate it into their devices (or, less likely, web developers go to the effort of making their pages “Spritz-ready” or somesuch similar standard).
 
	Here's what happens at 250 words per minute, which is at the top end of average for most people when it comes to reading speed:


                                          googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""Unit6""); });
                                        





	And here's 500wpm:




                                        googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""1x3""); });
                                      



	Clearly, it works. According to its creators, Spritz has been in development for almost three years, and it based on “research” that states 80 per cent of the time a person spends reading is taken up by the eyes moving and focusing on each new word. Cut that out, and you attain a huge boost in reading speed.

	The red letter in each word reflects what Spritz calls the optimal recognition point (ORP) – that's the bit of the word where the eye needs to focus to be able to grasp the overall shape and meaning of the word around it:

	Spritz, instead, relies on some visual stimuli research from the 1970s, on what's known as rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). It was developed as part of a study into how well participants could identify targets among a group of objects, flashed quickly on a screen; over time, further research revealed that RSVP made a good basis for a speed reading technique, with as much as a 33 per cent improvement in reading speed without any effect on comprehension. Spritz's novelty is the ORP, and aligning all words along that line to make all eye movement redundant. That's how they can claim that people can, unlike with those other speed reading techniques, reach as fast as 1000wpm with barely any training.

	So let’s say you’re really into what Spritz is selling, and want to start getting through War & Peace in less time than it takes to watch a full season of Breaking Bad. The practical limitations of reading text one word at a time should be obvious: shorter words are going to be easier to understand than longer ones, and Tolstoy’s epic is going to be more taxing to grasp word-by-word than, say, Harry Potter. Anything with weird formatting, footnotes or sentences that can last longer than the length of a page – here's looking at you, Infinite Jest – are going to be made incomprehensible with Spritz. There's a button to go back to the start of either the paragraph or sentence that the reader is on, but for texts that require multiple passes to fully grasp (like, say, a scientific study) Spritz is going to be a hindrance, not a help.

	That said, most people don't read those kinds of texts. Authors might be tempted to bemoan a change to the way that readers take in text, but for many people the ability to crunch down an email from a colleague, or their Twitter feed, in bursts like this will actually be pretty useful. The main usage that Spritz is touting is on devices, like smartwatches, that will be showing text designed for larger screens. Grokking a news story on a two-inch screen does seem like an obvious application for a speed reader app like Spritz, so it's going to be interesting to see if developers try to integrate it into their devices (or, less likely, web developers go to the effort of making their pages “Spritz-ready” or somesuch similar standard).

	The production will inevitably be compared to Hytner’s 2003 Iraq War-inflected Henry V; but Trump allusions here are more restrained.
	This is only the second ever production at London’s new Bridge Theatre and they’ve already started ripping out the seats. In the auditorium, which has been reconfigured around a central pit, the wafts of dry ice and abundance of plastic pint glasses gave me flashbacks to my short-lived career attending gigs in provincial civic centres. That impression was only heightened when a live band struck up “Cigarettes and Alcohol” (the undisputed highlight of Oasis’s 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe). Was this play being staged… in my youth?

	Whatever the rationale, I liked it. Entering a theatre too often evokes reverence rather than genuine excitement. The sensation of punkishly putting two fingers up at theatrical convention was only slightly dented by everyone being British, and therefore listening to the band with the kind of polite attention you give to a friend’s holiday photos. If this was “the mob”, it felt like making an early exit to beat the traffic was a stronger possibility than tearing someone limb from limb. Even “Seven Nation Army” failed to stir the hundreds of promenaders, who paid £25 each, to a rousing chorus of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”.

	Still, it was an interesting choice of song, because this production makes Julius Caesar firmly a play about populism, and my greatest fear was that it would fall into liberal piety: tonight, kids, we’re all going to learn that Dictators Are Bad. The director Nicholas Hytner had promised more, summarising the plot thus: “The liberal establishment is trounced by a demagogue who appeals to the gut, and tells the stories the mob wants to hear. The masses turn on the liberals. The tyrant is replaced by another, younger and more ruthless. Once the body politic is infected with the virus of authoritarianism, it can’t be eradicated.”

	The production will inevitably be compared to Hytner’s 2003 Iraq War-inflected Henry V; but unlike the recent Julius Caesar in New York, which gave the title character a blonde combover, the Trump allusions here are more restrained. The warning is not straightforwardly against dictatorship, rather the dangers of bypassing the political system with good intentions but insufficient muscle. How do well-meaning liberals uphold their principles when the other side fights dirty?

	Accordingly, Ben Whishaw’s Brutus has the air of one of those intellectuals who think that revolution is a brilliant idea right up to the moment they get shot for wearing glasses. In deposing Julius Caesar, he and his fellow conspirators give too little thought to what comes next, allowing Mark Antony (David Morrissey) to use Caesar’s funeral to paint the dead dictator as the people’s champion, murdered by a self-satisified elite. Paul Arditti’s clever sound design helps here, with the funeral speeches reverberating round the pit as Mark Antony declares Brutus to be an “honourable man”.

	In truth, this is one of Shakespeare’s wobblier plays. Hytner has sensibly hacked it down to two hours, no interval (still not beating the Donmar’s recent all-female production, which got through it in 90 minutes flat), but there is often movement as a substitute for drama. I found myself jealous of the promenaders: Bunny Christie’s dynamic set of rising blocks meant they got hustled round the space every few minutes, and their experience of the smoke and gunfire must have felt far more visceral than it did in the gallery. Plus you’re just inches from the actors: if you’ve ever wanted to be jostled by David Morrissey, this is your chance.

	With a “high concept” production, the fear is always that it’s compensating for flatness elsewhere; there seemed to be little love for the words, turning this into an intellectual experience rather than an emotional one. Caesar (David Calder) cuts a surprisingly weak figure in a battered sports jacket next to the tracksuited vigour of Mark Antony. The relationship between Brutus and Cassius (Michelle Fairley) is touching but underpowered, the minor characters well played but unmemorable. Still, I definitely agree that dictators are bad. l

639	"Spritz's text-streaming tech is the brainchild of a Boston-based startup of the same name, and seemingly uses witchcraft to let you read at incredible speeds. Somehow, just by highlighting one letter - which Spritz calls the ""optimal recognition point"" - in each word within a 13-character space, the app gets your brain to instantly identify and understand the word's meaning. Again, witchcraft. Why haven’t we heard of the app till now? Seems like Spritz went into “stealth mode”, and has been developing this tech under the radar for three years. You might think it’s a bunch of BS, but supposedly trial subjects were able to read and comprehend up to 900 words per minute.Seeing is believing, and you can try it out yourself at Spritz's own webpage before rounding up an angry mob with pitchforks for your witch hunt. There's a simple demo that’ll help you understand just how it works, and believe us, it's pretty fascinating. The tech hasn’t reached any platform beyond Spritz's homepage thusfar, but you could be seeing it in various devices soon. According to Spritz, it's planning to launch the app together with the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Gear2 - due April of this year - so we’ll just have to wait till those two devices hit our shores to really see how useful Spritz could be.Source: SpritzREAD MORE: Samsung Galaxy S5 preview: everything you need to know"	Science

	A new app which will allow people to read up to 1,000 words per minute - quadruple the average pace - is about to hit the market.
	Spritz, the software developer behind the new technology, aims to have 15% of the world's population using it to read by 2016.
	To understand how the app works, it's first necessary to understand how our brains process words. Slightly left to the centre of each word we read is something called the Optimal Recognition Point (ORP). This is the exact point at which our brains decode the random letters into something which actually means something. Spritz has shown than by breaking down sentences into successive displays of individual words, and highlighting the ORP of each word in red, our brains can process text much faster.
	Incredulous?
	Try it for yourself, beginning at 250 words per minute, which is slightly quicker than the average reader. You can go all the way up to 500 words per minute (a visual for 1,000 words per minute isn't yet available).

641	"Scanning a page from left to right to read the text might soon become an obsolete method thanks to a revolutionary piece of technology known as Spritz.The technology has made its debut on the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Gear 2, and has become astoundingly popular.Spritz's Text Streaming Technology enables easy reading in a format optimised for small screens.The ConceptBy serving up static blocks of text in a speed-reading text box, Spritz makes it possible for people to easily go beyond the average reading speed of 220 words per minute.It starts up at about 250 words per minute or wpm, and then progresses to speeds as fast as 1,000 wpm. How much faster does your reading become thanks to this? Well, for instance, a Spritz user can now read a 1,000-page novel in 10 hours or less.How does Spritz work? ""Spritz's technology streams individual words inside of a special display called the ""Redicle,"" which helps the eyes to position themselves precisely at the recognition point for each word,"" says a press release.""The most time-consuming part of reading is the eye movement from word to word. By applying their new method of word alignment that's based on the science of how people traditionally recognize words while reading, Spritz takes eye movement out of the equation, allowing much more to be read in the same amount of time. Spritz provides proprietary algorithms to identify how long to display words and sentences, providing an unparalleled natural reading experience.""Try Out A Sprtiz Session here and read at speeds up to 500 WPMSpritz Increases Traditional Reading Speed""When we started testing, we already knew that we were on to something but the comprehension tests surprised even us,"" said Maik Maurer, Co-Founder and CTO of Spritz.""Happily, our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension. We're now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user's traditional reading speed and comprehension, an effect reported to us by many of our testers.""What Languages does it work with?English, Spanish, French, German, Russian and Korean are currently supported by Spritz with many more languages on the way."

Last month, I messed around with a site that told me I read at 889 words per minute. I didn't believe it; I might be fast, but I'm not that fast. However, a new app is promising I could get faster, provided I'm prepared to get ""spritzing"".Here's how it works. When we're reading normal text, claims the team behind Spritz, a Boston-based startup focused on text streaming technology that launched at last month's Mobile World Congress, ""the eye seeks a certain point within the word, which we call the optimal recognition point, or ORP. After your eyes find the ORP, your brain starts to process the meaning of the word that you're viewing"". Your eyes then move to find the next ORP.Apparently, ""when reading, only around 20% of your time is spent processing content. The remaining 80% is spent physically moving your eyes from word to word and scanning for the next ORP"".The Spritz app gives you text with the ORP at the point where you're already looking, so you can read without moving your eyes. In ""stealth"" development for three years, it's intended for use not only with email and social media, but also digital books. ""Atlas Shrugged in a day? You betcha. We are currently working with some pretty big players in this field,"" says the app's website.You can try spritzing at spritzinc.com. At 600 words a minute I can, indeed, keep up. But I'm still nowhere near Dan Holloway, who, astonishingly, told us last month that ""for a couple of years [I] was reading anything up to 10 books and journals a day"". His technique is quite different from Spritz's, though: ""If I'm speed reading, I always use a 'guide', be it a pen or my finger, to inscribe shapes on the page (usually a lazy 'S' shape with two curves) to guide my eyes,"" he wrote on my blog.Anyway, spritzing is quite fun, and it seems to work. But the issue for me, which I think would stop me using it to read books, is the level of concentration it requires. You can't look away from the screen for a second, or you'd be utterly at sea. It's the only way I'd ever read Atlas Shrugged, though: strapped down, Clockwork Orange-style, in front of a spritzing book. The horror! The horror!"	Science
643	"A new app is going viral over the internet following the release of the new Samsung Galaxy S5. The app called Spritz, allows users to read in a faster pace. Spritz has been launched to practice theories regarding speed reading.According to the app's official site, the term ""spritzing"" means the new way of modern reading. This would help users speed read up to 1000 words per minute. Aside from allowing users to read pretty fast, Spritz claimed that most of what their readers read, is retained.The debut of the app came with the recent launch of the S5 in the market. After the launch, the app has become very popular worldwide, said the AmericanLiveWire report. The new app was developed by Spritz Technology Inc. after three years of research.The goal of the app is to have around 15% of the reading population to use it. If their studies prove right, Spritz can be used for training and educational purposes. Although there are a lot of reading apps available in the market today, Spritz claimed that a combined fast reading and comprehension, makes it unique.Sign up for our Deals of the Day newsletter.We will not spam you!Everything went well, You are now subscribed!

644	Main content starts below.Sign in to follow this authorFor a long time I've been curious about how to speed read. Traditionally the concept has been that you train your mind to scan content and absorb sentences, and eventually paragraphs in one gulp, as opposed to word by word. It can work, but it's hard and takes a lot of concentration.Recently I came across an innovation that seems so simple, yet it has the potential to change the way a large proportion of the world read, learn and absorb information. One of the main inhibitors to reading faster is ‘sub-vocalisation’ – think of it as talking to yourself while reading. That slows everything down, I imagine because it means you’re processing the words twice or three times before moving on.Before we all aspire to reading 1000 words a minute, perhaps we should stop to ask, Is it better to read faster?Well, for many purposes it probably isn't – for example, if you are trying to immerse yourself in a classic novel or complex material, and it requires your mind to churn over and reflect on what you just read in order to really grasp it.But for most of us, much of what we read isn't that - it's the news and magazines, interviews, 'About Us' pages, brochures, product reviews - the things that we are surrounded by on a day to day basis, including this post right here.Spritz launched just over a week ago, and after a few tries, I was reading (and comprehending) at about 500 words a minute.I definitely won’t be reading like this for everything, but I can see how it can turn me into a reading machine and what I like about it most is that it starts from a premise that abandons all previous expectations of reading. It does so in a similar way that a digital reading company I helped build, a startup called Booktrack, is redefining the reading experience through enabling movie style soundtracks to ebooks. It’s unprecedented.Spritz blows up the incumbent idea that we need to lay out words in paragraphs and spaces and across pages, and ‘digest’ them ourselves; instead it condenses them all into a thirteen character viewer screen that flashes the words at you - streaming them to your brain at your chosen speed.Ideas like Booktrack and Spritz are fascinating because they unlock a whole realm of possibilities. It’s now easy to imagine reading War and Peace on a device the size of an iPod Nano, or never having to awkwardly hold up a Kindle anymore because you can view text flashing across your Google glasses.I’m sure legions of people will hate what Spritz have done because they will say it degrades the reading experience and takes away the purity of reading. We had much of the same response when launching Booktrack - but there is a huge and growing fan base for this type of innovation, just because it isn’t for everybody doesn't mean it isn't groundbreaking. And often when people reject something loudly, it's also a sign of disruptive technology at best.An average novel is 90,000 words. Trialling Spritz it's easy to imagine getting comfortable reading at 1,000 words a minute - so that's a novel in 90 minutes. The Great Gatsby in 50 minutes. This blog post in thirty four seconds.What will we do with all that extra time or all that extra knowledge? Spritz yourself and tell me what you think.

645	Over the past few days more than a few friends of mine have been passing around a link to an article with the following link-baity title: “This Insane New App Will Allow You To Read Novels In Under 90 Minutes.” My ability to ignore such links[1. While letting out only the tiniest of sighs at the gauche-ness of the world.] is high, but there are limits to the number of times one can scroll by something an increasing percentage of one’s friends are interested in.Once I gave in (trusted?) my attention was more than a little grabbed. The aforementioned insane new reading app is called Spritz, and it aims to double, triple – even quadruple! he says in his best infomercial voice – the number of words we can read per minute (WPM). The weird thing is… well, it seems like it works. On their site, Spritz describes test subjects who are now reading at 900 WPM. For some perspective, that’s a rate which would allow one to complete Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in about 80 minutes. To the surprise of no one I have some thoughts about this, but first take a look at Spritz in action:  Pretty wild, right? And not uncool either (read: I am sorry for doubting you, friends), especially when it seems like comprehension isn’t declining as speed increases.But the relative coolness of apps like Spritz (Spreeder is another one) isn’t really what’s in question. The more fundamental – and more interesting – question that apps like this provoke is: What does it mean to read? How are these speed reading apps changing the meaning of reading? And will changing the meaning of reading also change us?Those might be strange questions because what’s happening here is that, rather than fundamentally transforming reading, Spritz and Spreeder are limiting it, narrowing it, constraining it. Yes, words are still linked together and processed, information is still communicated. But these apps are taking the formerly pluriform experience of reading and turn it exclusively into to what previously been only one of its many aspects: The rapid accumulation of knowledge.***Which is not to say that there are no benefits. Two have jumped out. First, they’re actually helping people sustain attention. Blogger Jim Pagel over at Slate wrote a helpful, concise piece to this effect just the other day. “Spreeder,” he writes,has completely transformed the way I read. Prior to using it, I would almost always lose focus during long articles, and at the end of each day, I’d have dozens of unread tabs to bookmark for later reading. Since I started using Spreeder, though, not only have I never run a daily reading deficit, I’ve actually run a surplus, starting to chip away at the mountain of bookmarked reading debt I’ve accumulated over the years.And second, early results are showing that Spritz and Spreeder are helpful for people with dyslexia, which is very cool.[2. From the Spritz website: “One of the keys of helping people with dyslexia and other reading issues is related to delimiting the content that is viewable to the reader to improve readability and comprehension – exactly what Spritz does. A Spritz-enabled application can be slowed down to accommodate any speed that a developer would like. Here is a direct quote from a dyslexic user: ‘Your product is AWESOME, for a dyslexic person as me, this feels VERY liberating!’ – Andreas from Sweden”]But considering reading as primarily a mountain to be chipped away to gravel, a task to be accomplished, comes with a cost. One of the more self-evident costs, given the visual structuring of Spritz wherein one word follows another, is that there is no chance to use structure to shape meaning. Take Shel Silversteen’s “Lazy Jane” as a simple example. We know this already, but the place poets choose to break their lines itself shapes the meanings poems can convey.Probing a bit more deeply returns us to the problem that speed reading itself tends to limit the purpose of reading to knowledge accumulation. What does this reduction of reading to knowledge do to works that refuse to be reduced to data-fication? What does this do to works that were never intended merely to be acquired as knowledge?All to say that reading via Spritz or Spreeder is something done as a task-to-be-accomplished. It means that Spritz reading is something you do in order to be done with it, to have completed it. Which is not a bad thing in and of itself, but it is accompanied by a temptation to forget that there is more to reading than simply a mountain of knowledge.***Aside from such cost/benefit analysis, however, technologies like this impose structural costs as well: They demand that we be ever more engaged in deciding what is good for us and what isn’t. To use a sociological term, they demand that we be ever more reflexive, ever more aware that we have to actively decide how we will allow things — and which things we will allow — to affect us.If consuming information at 900 WPM becomes the norm, what kind of heroic effort will be required of us to read, say, Rilke’s Book of Hours? Or to avoid reading the latest link-bait piece to cross a Twitter feed (after all, it will only take 30 seconds)? Real freedom, freedom from limitations we are not readily aware of, requires the cultivation of habits. As we’re habituated into reading as knowledge accumulation will we still have the freedom to read in other ways? Even more, will we be able to summon the effort – not to mention the time and distance and self-knowledge – to read without technological crutches even when it means reading so much less?We are limited creatures. YouTube adds 72 hours of video each minute – more than it will ever be possible to watch. The same, no matter how fast we read, goes for reading. Not only are we limited creatures, but we are limited creatures who are increasingly being asked to discerningly choose the habits we will cultivate, habits that directly affect the ways we normally treat the things with which we interact each day. When I open David Foster Wallace’s Consider the Lobster, how will I let it reach me? What would it even mean to “read” Psalm 139 at 900 WPM?Yes, Spritz and Spreeder and whatever app in the future will allow us to watch video at 400x the speed will help us get through more of it. But they only forestall the real problem: Our coming to terms with the reality of our finitude. This is a problem peculiar to our age, one in which we are asked what we will choose now that there are more goods to choose from than we can possibly consume.This problem can make us, as many of us know, enormously anxious. It used to be that our options were limited and we wanted more of them. Now, when the avalanche of information threatens to overtake us, the default response our culture provides is more and more reflexivity, saying, in effect: You choose. You deal with it. You sort it out. Your problem.Alternatively, we can take these tools as a challenge to discernment: To the spiritually mature choice between multiple goods. If we use them discerningly, to increase our freedom instead of simply increasing the amount of knowledge we can consume, we can use technology to humanize the time we are given.None of this is meant to condemn speed reading, it’s only to show it for what it is, a tool, not a savior. What these tools can’t do is save us from the question of what to read by attempting to answer: “All of it.”— — // — —	Science
646	Imagine if you could read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in a mere 77 minutes. Or latest YA favorite Divergent in just 105 minutes. Or a huge classic novel — like Les Miserables, which has roughly 560,000 words of text — in nine hours.You can speed read through these books — as well as emails, news articles and blogs — thanks to tech company Spritz, which is promising to change reading forever by altering the way readers view and process text. No more poring over lengthy sentences or losing your place on a page — instead, Spritz  is offering readers the chance to process text at speeds as high as 1,000 words per minute.Spritz will be releasing its technology on the yet-to-be-released Samsung Galaxy S5 and Samsung Gear 2 watch, the company recently announced at the Mobil World Congress in Barcelona. And with the phone or watch, readers will be able to process text one word at a time at various scrolling speeds. Whether one opts for 250 or 1,000 words per minute, Spritz is counting on making the brain change the way it expects and analyzes texts.It turns out that Spritz is basing its technology on a well-established speed reading method called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. Based on the same premise that trained speed readers use, the special display technology saves readers the time of reading a page from left to right by placing text at one spot at a specified speed. Add to that some fancy jargon called “Optimal Recognition Point” — ORP for short — which, according to Spritz’s blog, refers to highlighting certain text red so that your eye never needs to move from a central viewing point, and you’ve got the recipe for tackling the Bible in 13 hours flat.But what happens when the eye processes words — instead of relying on the brain to analyze context? The Boston-based start up isn’t the first to develop a speed reading app — vapps like Velocity and Speed Reading Trainer for Android  can be downloaded for just a few bucks — but EW has confirmed they are pitchings its technology to global tech giants like Google, Yahoo and Apple.So will Spritz prove an effective tool at tackling the hundreds of emails that seem to flood the average corporate employee daily? Or will authors find themselves competing for audiences for whom the story, instead of its delivery and prose, matters most? And what happens when the core of what makes great books great — the composed phrases that make us laugh, cry, ache and crave more — gets reduced to mere words? We know that technology  in the form of  e-readers has given a new generation a platform by which to consume books, but will the love and pleasure of reading be changed forever if pleasure can be reduced down to WPM? Are we saying “hello” to a new age of Cliff Notes — or beginning the process or saying “goodbye” to a form of communication that’s been established for centuries?	Science

Spritz, a lightning fast speed reading app, has launched to popularity as the mobile device app uses the top theories about speed reading and puts them into practice.According to the official Spritz site, “spritzing,” is the new form of reading that  enables users to read up to 1,000 words a minute. Not only can the reader read faster, but Spritz says they are also able to retain much of what they read.What is Spritz? Learn to Read 1000 Words a Minute – photo from YoutubeThis fast reader application has debuted on the Samsung Galaxy S5 and has already become astoundingly popular. The app was developed over three years of research by Spritz Technology, Inc.So how does Spritz work? The app initially starts off at 250 words per minute (wpm). The app then progresses the user to eventually read up to 1,000wpm. At that speed, a user can read a 1,000 page novel in 10 hours or less. Using an optimal recognition point, your brain is able to recognize words faster and better. On their website, Spritz explains:After your eyes find the ORP, your brain starts to process the meaning of the word that you’re viewing.The mobile reading app has the goal of having 15 percent of the world using its technology to read. If their studies are proven to be true, much of the world may look into using Spritz for educational and training purposes.While there are currently a handful of apps out in the market right now that claim to improve speedy reading ability, Spritz is unique as it applies actual theories of reading and comprehension.What is Spritz?

649	A feature coming to the new Samsung Gear 2 smartwatch and Galaxy S5 smartphone could revolutionize how people read.Called Spritz, the technology streams single words much faster than the average reading speed of 220 words per minute. Spritz highlights the “Optimal Recognition Point,” which is the point where the human brain recognized a word, and highlights it in red. Each word is displayed in the “Redicle” to keep the ORP in the exact same position, meaning the eyes don’t have to move from word to word as in traditional reading.    Spritz on Samsung Galaxy S5 and Gear 2.  Photo: Spritz  According to Spritz, the Boston-based company behind the technology, some users are “spritzing” at speeds of 1,000 words per minute, making it possible to read long novels in just a few hours. The company also claimed that reading with Spritz not only boosts speed, but increases reading comprehension.Here is a demonstration of Spritz working on 250 words per minute. And now at 500 words per minute:The app was been in stealth mode since 2012, but will be introduced to the public as way to read emails on the Samsung Gear 2 and Galaxy S5 without having to scroll, swipe, squint or zoom.    Sprtiz on Samsung Gear 2 Photo: Spritz  “As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently,” Frank Waldman, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Spritz, said in a press release. “Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device -- the options are almost limitless.”Spritz said that new users are able to double their traditional reading speed within minutes. After experimenting at the office, International Business Times staffers had no problem comprehending text streamed at 600 words per minute on their first use.Spritz is offered in English, Spanish, French, German, Russian and Korean. While it will debut on the Samsung Gear 2 and the Galaxy S5, Spritz said it will make the technology available for other operating systems, apps and websites. You can try out Spritz at their website. Subscribe	Science

651	Who says the Internet is making us less effective readers? Spritz, a new app that’s being released on Samsung devices, is devoted to turning you into a super-powered book devourer, conquering novels in a single bound (or subway ride).Spritz works by showing you a sentence one word at a time, displaying the words in quick succession. Then, the words speed up, and you’re forced to grasp their meaning much faster. 250 words per minute is easy, but 500 is like looking at a page through a strobe light.The highest setting of 1,000 words per minute would let you read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in just 77 minutes. The Bible would still take 13 hours, however.Spritz’s technology does much more than just run through words. It positions the different words around their central letters, aligning them so they’re easier for the eye to digest. It’s subtle, but it makes a big difference. Maybe now we can finally digest more than 140 characters?	Science
652	Last September, Apple released iOS 7, a major revamp of its mobile operating system for iPhone and iPad. Since then, we've seen a number of smaller OTA updates to the OS. Today brings the first major upgrade to iOS 7, though. This week, Apple finally released iOS 7.1, which brings with it a host of new features. So what can you expect with this iteration of iOS? Read on for the breakdown!Let's start with the big one: CarPlay. Announced in early March, CarPlay is Apple's in-car infotainment system. The company wants to make using your iPhone in the car safer and more fun. CarPlay will give users access to maps, GPS routing, iTunes, Siri, and the ability to make calls and send messages via the iPhone and iMessage.You can now manually control when Siri listens by holding down the home button and releasing it when you're finished asking your question. It's important to note that Siri isn't always listening for commands, rather this is an alternative method of letting Siri know when you've stopped talking. Before, Siri had to 'notice' by itself. Now, by releasing the home button, you're telling her (or him) you're done and it's time for her to go do her thing. Siri now also has some new voices, including some more natural sounding ones for Mandarin, UK and Australian English, and Japanese. These are available in both male and female versions.iTunes Radio will now let you buy albums based on the song that's currently playing with just one button press. Apple is also adding a search field above featured stations and allowing users to subscribe to iTunes Match via iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.In addition to the changes made to iTunes Radio, Music applications now have Shuffle and Repeat buttons for the times when you want to be surprised or when you don't.Apple's native Calendar app will now offer you the option of displaying events while in 'month view.' In addition to this, the company has added country-specific holidays for new countries (though the release notes don't offer a list, so you'll have to check yours and report back in the comments). Apple has also redesigned the list view. This one is specifically for iPhone 5S users. Owners of Apple's current generation smartphone will notice a new setting in the Camera application that automatically enables HDR. You can also use the new 'Upload Burst Photos' option, which is accessed via iOS Settings.We all know OS updates can be a point of uncertainty for those with older generation devices. If you're still rocking an iPhone 4, Apple is promising you a bump in performance. Cupertino hasn't offered any specifics on this, so we don't know what kind of bump you'll get, but with the iPhone 4 pushing four years old, it's nice users haven't been forgotten just yet.If you're used to FaceTiming across multiple devices, you'll be pleased to learn that call notifications from Apple's video calling application will now automatically be cleared when you take a call on another device.Apple has also made a few tweaks to the user interface that you'll no doubt run into sooner or later. These include a new 'Dark Keyboard.' You'll find this under the iOS Settings - > Accessibility.* There you can also navigate to the 'Increase Contrast' tab where you'll find a 'Darken Colors' option. You'll also notice that the bold font option now extends to the keyboard and calculator, and the Reduce Motion option includes Weather, Messages, and multitasking UI animations. The dialer has gotten a refresh, too, as has the slide-to-power-off UI. TouchID and Passcode now feature on the main menu when you navigate to iOS Settings and 'Touch ID requires your passcode when iPhone restarts' will now pop up when you restart your phone. While Apple has added plenty of new features with iOS 7.1, the bug fixes are a lot more sparse. This is largely because all the minor updates to iOS 7 up until now (iOS 7.01 to iOS 7.06, which was just released mid-February) have been about fixes. Though some of them brought additional features, they, for the most part, focused on fixing bugs, which means there isn't a boatload of bug fixes being administered with iOS 7.1.iOS 7.1 patches exploits used by the evasi0n7 Jailbreak. It also fixes a bug that caused home screen crashing, and improves TouchID recognition. There was also a problem with displaying the unread mail badge for numbers over 10,000. This has also been fixed. Other than that, we expect Apple will continue to roll out fixes on a case-by-case basis in future updates.*The Dark Keyboard option was apparently removed before final release. We've emailed Apple for clarification on this one. We'll let you know when we hear back.

@MikeBeasApple launched iOS 7.1 this morning after what seemed like an eternity in beta, making the first major update to the mobile OS since it was redesigned last year. Included in the update are several key features such as CarPlay, but also a collection of smaller tweaks and improvements that make system more convenient.Among those features are two very important ones that haven’t really gotten enough press: huge performance improvements on the iPhone 4 and something called “HFP prompts” in the Maps application…

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Tweetbot for MacPerformance improvements on iPhone 4As anyone who has used iOS 7 on an iPhone 4 will tell you, the older hardware is nearly incapable of keeping up with the newer software. Even with the disabled visual effects and other concessions attempting to keep things running smoothly, the entire system suffered from laggy animations and other problems.

As shown the video above, via ArsTechnica, the 7.1 update has mostly resolved these issues. Animations are no longer laggy and are much quicker overall than the previous version (as is the case on all devices to some degree, but more so on the iPhone 4).HFP Prompts in MapsThe second feature listed above is the addition of “HFP prompts” in the Maps app. You’d be forgiven for having idea what those are, given the unnecessarily technical name. This feature is designed to allow you to listen to your car’s built-in radio or other input devices while using your Bluetooth-connected iPhone for navigation.On previous versions of iOS, if you connected your iPhone to your car via Bluetooth and used it for navigation, you would only be able to hear the audible “turn left in 400 feet” prompts if you tuned your car’s stereo to the Bluetooth input. If you were listening to an FM radio station or a CD (people still listen to those, right?), you wouldn’t hear the prompts. Take it from someone who has done that before: this is not a good way to navigate anywhere.Image via Scott BuscemiImage via Scott BuscemiUnder iOS 7.1, a new audio setting in the Maps application allows you to enable HFP prompts, which will automatically tell your car to switch over to Bluetooth when it needs to play an audible direction reminder. After the phone is done speaking the direction, it will automatically switch back to whatever you were doing earlier. Essentially it will work just like a phone call or Siri through your car’s Bluetooth system.Hands-on with iOS 7.1Below we’ve embedded a few hands-on videos featuring the new changes in iOS 7.1 so you can see them in action for yourself. ZDNet has also compiled a set of screenshots showing some of the updated interface elements.iOS is Apple's mobile operating system that runs on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Historically, Apple releases a new iOS version once a year, the current version is iOS 11.Apple is continuing its efforts to market the iPad as a PC replacement and is available in four Retina display screen sizes: 7.9, 9.7, 10.5, and 12.9-inch.

Subtle changes I’ve noticed but haven’t seen mentioned:-If you delete an app (like I had to for room to install 7.1) and reinstall it, it reinstalls itself in its original location.
-If you have no music playing/paused/nothing in your music library at all, CC looks a little awkward in the middle.
-Redesigned ‘x’ for notifications in NC
-Smoother (albeit slower) transitions between panes in NC if you use a swipe; thankfully, however, multiple swipes register so you can do a double swipe to move over two panes (without lag).
-After restart, if you try to use Touch ID, it reminds you that you must put in a passcode with “Touch ID requires your passcode when iPhone restarts”, rather than “Passcode required after restart”.
-The “swipe to close” (AKA “claw”) gesture for iPad is much smoother.Someone who looks very closely at detail… I love it. Keep up the good work.:)The skip 10-15 seconds through a podcast from the lock screen or task bar is gone. Those assholes don’t want me skipping through commercials. The keyboard letters went front gray to black. (I’m sure already mentioned).The claw animation is spooling up in the background when you preform the motion, so now you wait for it by staring at your background for 1 second.Podcast skipping is working fine. Have you updated the Podcasts app?Oh wow thanks Robert. There was a podcast update yesterday specifically for the skipping thing. Nice. Still doing like the delayed claw.For the black keyboard, turn off the BOLD TEXT in Accessibility you had turned on when you first upgraded to iOS 7 to get a wider, darker font. Then it will look normal.“-Redesigned ‘x’ for notifications in NC” …this is a big improvement, it’s bigger, so it’s much easier to delete your notifications.Apple is so in dire need of a competent UI designer. What happened to elegance? As many people have said, Google is getting better at design faster than Apple is getting better at design.My Nexus 7 begs to differ.  I used it as my kid’s nighttime music player because the design sucks so bad (the physical design is horrendous, but the GUI isn’t great either).  If figured that was better use than as a doorstop. Just my opinion, like yours.Amen.Nah, love ios 7.Have had 2 android phones and 2 apple phones. Android phones are simply junk. I sent my last Android to my sister in Costa Rica. She wants my used iPhone when Im done with it.To be fair, Apple has been better at UI design than just about any big name in software for decades now. Google has only in the past couple of years started to gain a reputation for giving a shit about design – prior to that, they largely “designed by engineering”, and it showed. It’s no surprise that they’re getting better at it faster, now that they’re playing a catch-up game. They’re only just now starting to settle on a design language, whereas Apple is in the midst of transforming their own(which is rarely an elegant process). iOS 7.1 still has a lot of rough edges, but it already feels far more refined than 7.0.I don’t know what you call Google+, but I don’t call it “giving a shit about design” OR “designed by engineering”.Google+ is “designed by sales and marketing”, and it is the worst piece of garbage since Altavista decided to put advertising on their search site.  Real Player followed Altavista down that path.  Now Google is getting into the action, albeit 10 years later.When your design starts at a bar you could trip over, any improvement must seem quantum. And that “Google/better/design/faster/Apple/cloud” quote needs to be taken out back and shot.Design wise, iOS7 was a huge step back. It gave in to trends of the day that quickly looks outdated. Yes, Apple design started out at a high bar, but iOS7 did not improve on it, it took the bar down. What ever happened to the legendary Apple attention to detail? It was released half baked and looks like an intern quickly threw it together,Just in case this doesn’t get pointed out to you by someone else, you have no design credentials. “Half baked and looks like an intern quickly threw it together”? Please don’t expect to be taken seriously when your contributions consist of meaningless, over-the-top screed.Very funny. Waze looks like finding memo. It would be nice to see Google Apple-fy Waze. Then I might take RP seriously.iOS7 looks like Finding Nemo, so who copied who?Please decrypt HPF Prompts. Surely the acronym has a meaning.HFP – “Hands-free protocol”Thanks – Very coolOne thing I haven’t seen mentioned is the banner notifications when you pull down. In iOS 7.0.6, the banners followed the pulldown of notification center. Meaning, if I had one notification and pulled down even a little, I could see it. With iOS 7.1, you need to pull down notification center 3/4 or all the way down.I personally don’t like this as much. I enjoyed being able to pull down a little, read the notification, and swipe it up out of the way. Now I basically need to fully activate notification center to see it and then fully close it. Kind of a hassle and definitely not as quick.But I do appreciate the rest of the updates. Feels much faster/more responsive.Go to The Camera> new HDR Auto option including HDR ON, HDR OFF is added. and found a bug in the CC; that even after closing any of your music apps including the built in Music app, the CC still shows the app’s name. Dont know if it is meant to be like that or a bugIt’s very zippy on a 5s, especially tapping home. Animations are faster in a lot of areas, but slower in others. I still find myself swiping before an animation is completed (so it goes unregistered) but it happens way less than in iOS 7. And it even makes my iPad 3 run a little faster.
A little… And kinda strange but they added one new wallpaper for the iPadReblogged this on JIGS THANKI and commented:
What’s new in #iOS 7.1? Safe for #Jailbreak? New Features!ROFL, you mean they’re going to get rid of all their artificial slow downs to make me upgrade?Hardly artificial. iOS 7 was very badly optimized for the iPhone 4 due to the short production time and unnecessarily fast release time. They took a lot more time to focus on it for this update.Also: the phone is almost 4 years old. Tell you what: cut that time in half, buy and Android phone today and tell me how your phone’s doing with OS upgrades in 2016.Thought so.I’ve also noticed, when you flick the volume slider, the motion is a lot more smoother, and there is a bounce on the end•  CarPlay

Have been suffering from battery drainage since iOS6, and iOS 7 made it worse. It won’t last for a full day now, unless on Airplane mode. When it was iOS5, the battery lasts for ages. Anyone has any remedy that could help in any way?May not work for you, but when that happens to me I always review the apps I have location services turned on for. There are always a few that I used briefly and forgot about that are creating some drain. After returning location services to the way I want it I find my battery lasts much longer. Good luck.Another possibility could be the age of your iPhone 4S? If you bought it when it originally came out the battery life will be shortened over time. I bought the iPhone5 when it first came out and it’s now my son’s phone and it won’t hold a charge for the entire day. He is of course a little more active on the phone than I was but when I first gave it to him he didn’t have a problem with it holding a charge all day.Replacing the old battery on your iPhone4 or iPhone4S is very straight forward… unless you’re a total incompetent.  Even a local mom and pop shop can do it for $20.  So if your battery is tired from 1000 cycles, think about taking action.  I did, and I’m a better person for it.New changes are great!!!  However, didn’t fix my issue with the random restarts :(Not sure how long it’s been doing this, but I just noticed that the clock app icon is animated now and shows the correct time. Any chance they will do something similar with weather by giving me the temperature of my current location?hmmm, while you missed the clock app icon has shown the correct time since iOS 7.0, I don’t recall the second hand showing, I do think that is new!Reblogged this on Taste of Apple and commented:
I’ve definitely noticed a lot of solid improvements across the system.That was a great video and it showed me features on my 5S that I was unaware of in 7.1.
Thanks!AssistiveTouch’s pointer overlay design has been changed from a ringed cyan circle to a ringed grey dot set on a black background.P.S. iOS 7 was a disaster on the iPhone 4 and my friends who own iPhone 4s have found iOS 7.1 to be a great upgrade. Not everyone can afford the latest Apple device and 7.1 is a real life saver for the iPhone 4 users.new weather icons in weather appThe big change for me was the volume notification is gone when you raise or lower the volume while watching a video. Typically you will get a rounded square that says volume and shows the bars and it will cover the center of the video that was playing…now while watching the YouTube video above, the volume just raises and lowers in the native video controls. That was one thing I sent to Apple as a complaint, must have been enough people with the same issue.not a big improvement…when you raise the volume, it brings up the top & bottom bars, so, it still blocks the view to adjust volume, just in a different way.Also, anywhere else, adjust the volume or change the ringer and that blur box STILL blocks the view.This is a huge UI error. I’m a creative person, I care about design, but, making that square blurred to maintain overall design consistency is really a flaw because it gets in the way of functionality. There is no reason why Apple could not make some elements transparent for the sake of user functionality.I sent my complaint to Apple, please, help make noise about this: http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.htmlI hate google, but, at least they got it right with the YouTube app, in this respect, Apple needs to take a hint here. (One bar on bottom, and it is translucent, not blurred). All Apple has to do to make it different from this is make it white instead of grey overlay, just make it TRANSPARENT. Simple.Most videos are boxed out anyways, so the fact that the controls appear doesn’t bother me any. It is still around for everything else though, could be moved to the bottom as a transparent footer instead. What kind of design work do you do? I’m currently 3 semesters out from graduating with my BA in Graphic Design Specializing in InterActive Design.My theory is that they only bothered to optimise iOS 7 for the iPhone 4 because they’re bringing it back into production again for sale in emerging economies.
It will be a welcome update to all iP4 users, I’m sure. But it’s driven purely by economics, not Apple’s goodwill. I don’t ever remember other legacy (approaching 4 years now, gosh that’s gone fast!) hardware getting such a drastic performance improvement in an update.A public corporation taking an action that is not motivated by profit is doing a disservice to their shareholders (owners).Maintaining good customer relationships is very much providing good service to your shareholders.  Case in point: see GM versus Toyota in the 1970s versus today.  GM pissed off its customers with poor customer relationship management.   People that left GM 30 years ago are unlikely to go back now, even if they have improved 300% since then.you got that right. But, why Apple brings back the 4 when they would be better off with the 4S, seems very odd. (The 4S has an all-in-one cell chip, so they only have to produce one model for all carriers, whereas the 4 has several models. (neither has LTE))(my reply was to Aaron)I like all the changes that 7.1 has brought to my iPhone but there is still one basic function missing that drives me nuts. They need to allow the clearing of history for updated apps in the updates section. It’s not a big thing but those of us that are a bit OCD, it means a great deal! I hope it is added in the near future.The shuffle album function in the music app works properly now.Vibration seems to be stronger or more pronounced. Could just be me, though.Trying to install 7.1 I’m informed that I need to remove some apps/data from my 16gb 4s to get to the needed 2gb for the install. No problem, except I can’t find any info as to whether that required extra space will be freed up again after the install is finished. In other words, is  7.1 significantly larger than 7.0x?Hey. Guys updates to iOS 7.1 today   But noticed that there is some battery issues  and I think apple should  release an update for that issue. Hope apple rectifies it soon and releases an update for the battery issuesI’m glad that they have the option to show calendar events when you’re in month view, but it seems like they took away the list view to show all events. Before this update, if you hit the search icon, it would show a list of all events. Now, you press it, and all you get is a search box and a blank results area. I can search for ‘e’ and get most listings, but leaves out important results such as “Work”. We get one feature back and lose another.in new update still Indian Flag not available for whatsapp or emoji…but in android this is available for whatsapp…What I still miss is a way to delete all mails with a maximum two taps. I can’t believe that this is not possible. I know there are some special “tap-hold-release-combinations” out there… Impossible to remember and only working sometimes.Is it me or is there a problem with the texting? Since I upgraded I have had a few conversations disappear from my list of text messages. They are still there but not showing. As example, one friend had sent me 11 text messages last night but the entire conversation was missing.. Once I figured out it was them I started a NEW conversation and as soon as I typed 1 letter the old conversation popped up. Very odd indeed! Had I not guessed it was them, I wouldn’t of had a clue who these 11 messages would of been from.New weather app! Better animations and colorsIt seems (and i hope it’s true) that bluetooth streaming has improved. It used to cut off and was impossible to get going again. I’m listening to Pandora on my  Bose bluetooth speaker and so far it’s working..Fingerrs crossed. Anyone else have that problem?Is anyone else having problems with ios 7.1 on iphone 4 with the notification center. I have everything turned on but i get nothing, The sound for the notification chimes on but i get no banner and nothing on the lock screen. I have went into the settings and changes settings in there, restarted my phone, even restored my phone and nothings seems to work. I was just wondering if it was me or something wrong with the updateIn the new passcode panel the option of turning off Voice Dial is removed, do you know how to find it again?I don’t have my passcode anymore on my phone. How do I get it back?I have an iPhone 4. With the update to 7.1 I noticed a change to the music player. Holding it upright I see the what is currently playing. If I turn it on it’s side the screen changes and shows me my other music, which is rather annoying when I just turn the phone to the side and tap a song by mistake. Now I am listening to another song and have lost what I wanted to listen to. Is there a way to turn this off?"	Science

Apple today released iOS 7.1, adding support for its new CarPlay automobile integration, manual control for Siri voice commands and better TouchID support. The company also claimed to have fixed a bug that caused the homescreen to crash, which should hopefully address the issue where iOS devices randomly restart themselves.CarPlay, which launched earlier this month, allows a car’s in-dash system to control the Phone, Music, Maps, Messages and third-party audio apps.The new Siri feature now lets you activate Siri while holding the button down so that it will stop listening once you let go. Siri also includes “more natural sounding” voices for Chinese, UK English, Australian English and Japanese.iOS 7.1 includes minor updates to iTunes Radio, Calendar and Accessibility, as well as subtle changes to the user interface. The iPhone 5s can now automatically enable HDR, and the iPhone 4 should have better performance.In advance of the iOS 7.1 release, Apple pushed out iOS 7.0.6 in late February in order to address a serious SSL bug that exposed users to potential attack.Here’s the iOS 7.1 change log from Apple:CarPlaySiriiTunes RadioCalendarAccessibilityMiscellaneousImage credit: Lintao Zhang/Getty Images

	Apple has released iOS 7.1 - the latest free upgrade to its software that runs the iPhone, iPad and iPad Touch (note that while it's free, iOS 7.1 weighs in at a hefty 2.5GB, so make sure you're on the boss's wi-fi before you download it).
	The update adds support for Apple's new CarPlay technology, which will sync with built-in displays from most major car makers over the next few months to year.
	On a more everyday level, iOS 7 lets you manually control Siri by holding down the Home button then releasing it when you've stopped voicing an instruction. No more awkward pauses.
	The update also includes several security and stability bug fixes (including a gremlin that crashed the iPhone 5s) and boosts performance on the iPhone 4.
	Apple says the update also improves fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 5s. It also adds the ability to automatically enable HDR on the 5s.
	iOS 7 is compatible with the iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C, and 5S; the iPad 2, both Retina iPads, both iPad minis, and the iPad Air; and the fifth-generation iPod Touch.
	Update by clicking Settings > General > Software Update.

662	"By Troy Wolverton						 / March 10, 2014 at 6:47 PM iPhone and iPad users, the long-awaited update to the software underlying the handheld devices is finally here.Apple on Monday released iOS 7.1, the first significant revision to its handheld operating system since Apple overhauled the software last fall. The update includes bug fixes, interface changes and the company’s new CarPlay technology, which will allows iPhone users to access Siri and their apps through the entertainment system in some new cars.Macworld has a full run-down of all the changes in the revision. Among the more notable new features are a way to view events from a particular day in the calendar app while glancing at a full’s worth of dates and a way to turn Siri off and on manually by holding down the home button.For me, perhaps the biggest promised change is a fix to a bug that causes iOS devices to randomly reboot every so often, displaying the white (of black) screen of  death in the process. I’m also eager to test the improvements Apple says it has made in the ability of the iPhone 5s’ Touch ID sensor to recognize fingerprints.Photo of Apple’s CarPlay technology courtesy of Apple.Tags: Apple, bug fixes, bugs, carplay, iOS, ios 7, ipad, iPhone, iPod Touch, siriMore Posts in Big TechShare this PostPopular PostsArchivesRelated Feeds Education WordPress Theme byCopyright © 2018 Bay Area News Group.

665	Like tech videos? Subscribe to Ubergizmo on YoutubeAfter what seemed like forever, Apple has recently released iOS 7.1 to the masses. Granted iOS 7.1 isn’t exactly a super huge update unlike iOS 6 to iOS 7, but apparently it has been deemed important enough where Apple has actually created a page on its website specifically for iOS 7.1.That being said, iOS 7.1 does bring a host of changes, improvements, and bug fixes to the operating system and if you were wondering what exactly has Apple changed, perhaps a 5 minute walkthrough video might allow you to educate yourself on the new features implemented into the OS.The video has been put together by the folks at iDeviceHelpus and it takes the viewer through the changes made, as well introducing new features such as CarPlay and the update to Siri amongst other things.For those who haven’t been following our coverage of iOS 7.1, the update actually makes some aesthetic tweaks to the platform. iOS 7 is already a huge change from iOS 6, but we guess Apple thought that there were additional graphical tweaks that could be made.This is evidenced in the power off switches and the dialer app, as well as the keyboard app which has been improved slightly as well. We’re not necessarily sure these changes are for the better, but we guess time will tell and we will see how people react to them.In any case if you have  a few minutes to spare and you’re wondering what awaits you in iOS 7.1 and whether it might be worth upgrading too, despite there not being a jailbreak available for it at the moment, check out the video above.Filed in Apple.

666	"Apple has released its first major update for iOS 7 — version 7.1, natch — which brings ""improvements and bug fixes"" to iDevices, including better Touch ID fingerprint recognition, the option to further reduce the on-screen animations that sickened some users, and a boost to performance on the iPhone 4.Apple brags of iOS 7.1's tweaks

(click to enlarge)The update, available from Monday, includes support for CarPlay – previously more-prosaically named ""iOS in the Car"" – which Apple announced at last year's Worldwide Developers Conference, and which Cook & Co. said last week would first appear in vehicles from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo, with Nissan, BMW, Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover, and others following on.Siri also comes in for a few tweaks, including allowing you to simply release the home button to put her to work after mumbling your request rather than, as before, waiting until she recognized that you had finished speaking — a tweak that should be a boon in noisy environments.Siri also has added what Apple describes as ""new, more natural sounding"" voices, both male and female, in Mandarin Chinese, UK and Australian English, and Japanese.In a classic case of fixing a bug that no reasonable programmer ever thought would appear in the first place, iOS 7.1 ""fixes display of Mail unread badges for numbers greater than 10,000."" The Reg respectfully suggests that should a user have over 10,000 unread messages on their iPhone or iPad, the bug is not to be charged to iOS, but to the fanboi.Complementing the additional Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion debarfification assistance noted above – which, by the way, was first tweaked in iOS 7.0.3 – the Accessibility > Bold Text option now also emboldens the touch keyboard, likely in response to those users who complained that many of the fonts used in iOS 7 were a bit on the spidery side.Standard keyboard, left; emboldened keyboard, right — no biggie, but undoubtedly helpful for someOther new Accessibility options include the ability to place more-obvious buttons behind tappable text, darken app colors, and turn down the blinding white background of some iOS apps, another complaint that was heard when iOS 7 debuted last September.As is usual with Apple's operating system updates for both Macs and iDevices, the listing of features helpfully points you to the ""Apple security updates"" page, but no information appears on that page at the time of the update's release.If you want security-upgrade details, you'll need to wait. Sometimes for only a couple of hours, sometimes for a day or so. ®

668	"Spectacle. We love it. That moment when technology changes and our minds are blown. It's easy to forget that many ""one more thing"" things were actually pretty boring: the iPod mini, Safari for Windows, the Power Mac G5.Our current obsession with ""new categories"" derives from the heroin-like highs of the iPhone and iPad. While every year, Apple's laptop and desktop lines iteratively improve in user features and hardware, it's hard to get past that rush of newness that iOS delivered. Even iPod, the consumer device that more or less revolutionized Apple's marketplace in 2001, didn't produce the kind of magical expectations that iOS mobile did.Is Apple still innovating? Is the Tim Cook catholic...er...in the woods...um...wait, I'm pretty sure there's a metaphor here that means ""yes"". Yes, Apple is still innovating. Since we haven't had our next holycrapdoodle moment, I'm going to guess that none of these internally developed products have been suitable or mature enough to bring to market yet.There's the whole wearables thing... If you're willing to strap your iPhone 5S to your forehead, it's already here with its new-fangled motion chip supported by literally several apps! It's not what everyone was expecting, but it kind of positions Apple. There's also Apple TV, which keeps getting better but still doesn't ""rule the living room"" in any meaningful way. And then there's that car thing, which, *shrug*.Back in reality, there are lots of hints in iOS 7 about possible future directions. The latest OS now supports hardware keyboards including control keys, and alt keys, and stuff like that. There's also massively expanded support for document containers like RTF. It all could potentially hint at a toasterfridge merging of iOS and OS X -- or not.The problem is that two major innovations do not a corporate trend make. They were amazing but they may not have been defining as in specifically ""Apple is the company whose new products always produce paradigm shift"". Sure, we want more amazing but it's not something that it's reasonable to expect on a regular, scheduled basis. You know the meme. Meth, not even once.That's within 6 months after the official launch.The company's maps and directions keep getting better.It helps you feel temperature and pressure, but it can also take damage.It's free, if you have a cable subscription.A new study shows much higher error rates for people who aren't white or male."

As well as fully introducing CarPlay, tweaking the user interface and zapping some pesky bugs, Apple's newly released iOS 7.1 update also features support for some mystery iPads.As spotted by iClarified, the new OS features update bundles for iPads under the model identifiers 4,3 and 4,6, which are yet to be officially acknowledged by the company.
The current iPad Air with Wi-Fi and its cellular extension are known as 4,1 and 4,2, while the iPad mini 2 models are identified as 4,4 and 4,5.What these new model numbers mean remain to be seen, but it seems unlikely they represent brand new iPads in the traditional sense.In the past, Apple has been known to quietly boost the hardware within existing models using, for example, slightly different processor configurations when there's a component shortage.It's also possible those unidentified models could be bound on the China Mobile network which, as Apple Insider points out, runs a unique TD-LTE 4G network and would require their own certification.Have you downloaded iOS 7.1 for your existing iPhone, iPad or iPod touch yet?

672	Apple has just released iOS 7.1, the first major update for iOS 7 since its launch back in September. The update has been available to developers for some time and brings a lot of small but interesting changes to Apple’s mobile OS, including continued visual tweaks of the all-new iOS 7 design.The update adds official support for CarPlay, which has been the talk of the town recently thanks to its official unveiling at the Geneva Auto Show. Three car makers have already demonstrated their CarPlay vehicle integration, including Volvo, Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1435859868582-4'); }); In a relatively rare move, Apple has put up a full page detailing the new features of iOS 7.1.In addition to CarPlay, you can now manually control how long Siri listens to you by holding down the home button while you speak and releasing it when you’re done. This replaces the ‘listen until you’re done talking’ behavior that Siri exhibited previously. Siri also gets improved, ‘more natural’ voices in Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English and Japanese.There have been some visual tweaks as well to things like the shift keys on the keyboard, the in-call buttons, lock screen icons and more. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1437164032276-1'); }); The calendar now has an events list in the month view, the lack of which caused many complaints in previous versions of iOS 7. A list of events has become the default way that many use their calendars, so this is welcome.iTunes Radio now allows you to quickly create stations with a search and now allows you to subscribe to iTunes Match right from an iDevice to get an ad-free experience.On the accessibility front, the ‘Reduce Motion’ option now applies to Weather, Messages and the multitasking screen. This reduces the parallax effect that some users had complained was making them ill. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1437164032276-0'); }); For those of you who have had issues getting TouchID to work correctly, you’ll be pleased to see that there are improvements to its fingerprint recognition included in this update. Older iOS users will also be happy to see some performance improvements for the iPhone 4.A recurring bug which has caused the home screen to crash — resulting in a quick ‘reboot’ of your device while using it — has also been fixed with this version. FaceTime call notifications are now cleared and synced across devices, iCloud Keychain support has been expanded to new countries and the iPhone 5s gets a new Camera setting that automatically enables HDR.You can download iOS 7.1 via the software update feature of your device or via iTunes.Source: techcrunch.comContribute to Atlanta Black Star today and help us share our narratives.

673	Canadians will soon need to pay more to watch series and movies on Netflix. The company has raised the price of its plans for both new and existing users. While the rise has been already implemented for new subscribers, existing users will be notified through email before new rates are charged from them.In a statement released by Netflix, the company cited addition of new content and introduction of new features and services as the reasons behind the price rise. It said that Netflix adjusts the pricing of its packages from time to time as they introduce new movies, exclusive TV series and upgrade their platform to offer better services to its customers.The company has a huge database of content and also produces its own original content which has become popular like House of Cards. It also has a large number of movies sourced exclusively from international film festivals. Few of USA TV shows are also aired by Netflix in Canada like CW’s Riverdale and ABC’s Scandal.Netflix has a growing market in Canada and in 2016 it had around 5.2 million subscriptions. The television streaming market is quite competitive in Canada and many leading names are fighting out with each other.Brands like Amazon prime are quite a hit in the country having Canadian airing rights of highly rated shows such as American Gods and Mr. Robot. CBS All Access is also set to enter the Canadian market sometime in 2018 with its 9,000 episodes from various shows. The multiple numbers of competitors and the fight to acquire rights for shows has increased the acquisition cost of the content. Though Netflix did not mention it in their statement, still it is a situation faced by all companies in Canadian television industry.Netflix increased their prices last year in May while introducing the feature of streaming in high quality on multiple devices. This time the increase has been $1 for the basic plan making it $8.99 per month. Users can only stream standard quality videos on a single device at a time. The cost of the standard plan has also gone up by $1 ($10.99 per month) which permits subscribers to access content on two screens. Subscribers of the premium plan now have to shell out a monthly $13.99, which is a $2 increase from the previous price. Users can view high definition 4k videos simultaneously on four screens with this plan.The company changes its prices based on local market conditions in a country. The Australian subscribers had to pay few dollars more after Netflix raised the prices in June countering the increase in local taxes. It remains to be seen how the users will respond to the move.TV streaming service in Canada will get a major boost next year with the introduction of CBS Corp’s CBS All Access service. It is the company’s bid to go international that prompted the move and gave Canada the first opportunity to enjoy its content.The online streaming service in the US has a huge database of content and around 9,000 episodes from its various series. Viewers will also get access to special CBS channels like Showtime without requiring a cable connection. Apart from television activities, those who fond of games playing can try out one of the secure Canadian source NBSO online casino games list website. It is free and has a high level of reliability (si vous parlez français, essayez de choisir des jeux sur le site web du guide spécial casino en ligne, qui est fiable et gratuit).CBS corp. has a good chance of creating a considerable grab on the market but it lacks on one ground. The copyrights of many of its shows are already purchased by Canadian broadcasters like Rogers Communications Inc., BCE Inc. and Corus Entertainment Inc. So viewers will not get to see shows like Survivor or The Big Bang Theory and some of the shows are also aired on Netflix. The restricted content may impact the number of subscribers the company is expecting.We have to wait and see as CBS predicts they are going to have 4 million subscriptions by the end of this year. It is interesting to note that TV viewership is declining in Canada and online streaming services are giving a tough competition to the traditional form. In 2016, the volume of subscribers reduced by 1% and reached 11.1 billion viewers and the revenue fell by 2% amounting to $8.7 billion, according to the data from Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.On the other hand, online streaming services have gained increased number of subscriptions. Netflix recorded a growth of 52 million viewers in US alone and another 52 million from all over the world. Compared to that, 158,000 people in Canada disconnected their cable service in 2015. It can be expected that the market is ripe for online streaming in Canada and other players like Hulu and HBO Go may join the competition in some years.With so many providers in the game, the price is also a big factor in getting subscriptions. CBS did not reveal the rates they will charge in Canada, but in the US current rates are $5.99 per month. To get a commercial free version, viewers have to pay $9.99. If the rates are any higher, then Canadian may not be too interested in joining up considering the limitation of content.Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS said that they were aware of the potential of online streaming judging the success of their competitors. The introduction of the service in Canada gives them the chance to directly reach the viewer on an increased scale which can be expanded globally. CBS All Access had achieved a growing domestic market and now is ready with their premium content to hit the international arena.Auto insurance provider Intact Insurance in Nova Scotia plan to use mobile apps to track driver habits to determine the premium rates in the future. Based on the way one drives, they can be eligible for a 25% savings on their insurance premium!The idea may sound out of a science fiction movie but the concept has existed for some time. Many companies like Intact Insurance offer a plug in dongles for vehicles which are used to track driver habits. Intact insurance revealed that the dongle program included 350,000 participants from all over the country. It was introduced at N.S in 2014.However, they are not always the practical solution due to various reasons.First is the cost that prohibits their universal use and in some cases, the devices are not returned to the company. They can also be lost adding to the cost of the company. Another reason is the dongles track the habits of any driver that gets behind the wheel and it is not possible to distinguish between them.Mobile apps have many unique advantages that make them a pragmatic solution for the insurance companies. The app would be using the smart phone of the driver and eliminate any expense on part of the insurance provider. They will also be able to specifically track the habits of the insurance payer which is their priority. It will only monitor the main driver as the app will be linked to his mobile phone.The tool will be used to track aspects of sudden accelerations, hard braking, night driving utilizing the GPS feature of the phones. Intact Insurance applied for permission to launch the program from the N.S Utility and Review Board which was granted on August 4. The company plans to launch the service next month starting September. The initiative will be a way to reward drivers with good habits and give them lower insurance rates for their performance.For the time being, the app or the dongle insurance rates are optional in Canada. But according to experts, a day may come when it automatically becomes more preferable considering the costs. With the advance of technology, the companies may increase the cost of the premium and people will opt for the tracking program for affordability.But not all customers may be willing to join the program. It has been seen that many consumers do not prefer to join such programs. Some also practice bad driving habits like speeding or other dangerous stunts which may impact the insurance rates. There are also some apprehensions about the nature of data collected by the app and its usage by the company. But as the insurance industry is regulated it has not misused the user data under its control.	Science

If iOS 7 was a fresh coat of paint for Apple's operating system, then today's iOS 7.1 release is a much-needed touch up six months into the redesign.This essential software update fixes a number of unresolved bugs that complicated owning an iPhone 5S, iPad Air and iPad mini 2.
iOS 7.1 also features a handful of user interface tweaks that alter the non-skeuomorphic design. They're still flat, but a little rounder than before.We pored over the official release notes and tested out iOS 7.1 to find that while there aren't a lot of major changes, its ability to remedy iOS 7 glitches makes it worth downloading immediately.The most pervasive glitch is what Apple is calling ""an occasional Home screen crash bug."" Users have more aptly nicknamed it the ""white screen of death"" glitch.By either name, it's an annoying software defect that randomly forced iOS devices into a soft reset. A blank screen with the Apple logo would suddenly show up for no apparent reason.While users have complained about this task-closing glitch since September 2013, Apple hasn't been able to fix it until now. It first acknowledged the problem and promised a solution in January.The company didn't reveal why this glitch occurred, but it's thankfully gone according to our tests today. Six months is far too long to wait for such a patch.Apple is putting iOS in the Car, even though its infotainment ecosystem doesn't go by that more direct name anymore.CarPlay is enabled through iOS 7.1 on any iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C or iPhone 5 as long as it's paired with a compatible vehicle.So far that includes the Volvo XC90 SUV, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and the Ferrari FF with more car models and manufacturers to come.The release notes indicate that CarPlay brings phone, music, maps, messages and third-party audio apps to the hands-free infotainment center.Users can also control everything through Siri or via the car's touchscreen, knobs and buttons.Flat circles are in and skeuomorphic boxes are out, according to Apple's iOS design tweaks. The look and feel of iOS 7.1 makes such alterations to the call and power-off screens.The answer and end button are now green and red circles. These smaller but more fashionable pair match the caller's round photo icon.The same treatment was given to the revised power off slide bar. Holding down the sleep button brings up a new white and red button, replacing the ugly reddish-orange bar.All animations have been sped up too, making iOS 7.1 instantly faster when sliding through and opening up apps. It's almost as if the processor got a speed boost without the necessary hardware upgrade.Siri is easier to operate in iOS 7.1. Before, Apple's personal assistant would often cut you off mid-sentence, complicating it as a hands-free solution.Now, holding down the home button manually controls Siri so that you can drone on and on without having her interrupting your bloviating commands.Apple's release notes indicate that its Touch ID fingerprint recognition system has improved with iOS 7.1. Users have previously complained that the scanner forgets their fingerprints.The Camera and Calendar apps are the final tweaks Apple is highlighting in iOS 7.1. The iPhone 5S automatically enables HDR photos through the Camera app, while Calendar brings the much-needed ability to view events by month.All of these upgrades aren't significant and few iPhone users can take advantage of CarPlay, but today's minor update is a step in the right direction as we await bigger changes for iOS 8 this fall.Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

676	Hours after Apple released its newest version of iOS for iPhones, iPads and iPods – the all new iOS 7.1, people who dug deep into the core of the new software came up with some startling facts. The code has references to two new hitherto unheard of devices in the list of hardware that iOS 7.1 supports. The new devices appear in the list as iPad4,3 and iPad4,6. These model numbers are internal code names for product variants and were not known to have existed on any document in the public domain, until today that is.While excited bloggers have already talked about the possibility of these being entirely new iPad variants that could be launched soon, experts are of the opinion that these references within iOS 7.1 are more likely to be minor upgrades to the hardware over the existing iPad models. These revisions usually involve internal components and do not affect the product performance in a noticeable way. In short, these might be inconsequential “upgrades” that might be of little value to the end consumer.In case you are unaware, here’s what folks from over at iPhoneHacks have to say about the internal code names for the current iPad versions. According to them, the existing iPad Air models bear internal model numbers iPad4,1 and iPad 4,2. The Retina iPad Mini models are known internally as the iPad4,4 and iPad 4,5. It is therefore highly plausible that the “new” iPad 4,3 could be a slightly tweaked iPad Air while the iPad 4,6 could be a tweaked Retina iPad mini. Of course, these are just calculated guesses at this point of time. In the past, there have been instances like these where a products internal codename was changed midway through its life-cycle after it received a minor update. Case in point, the Third generation Apple TV, which was initially labelled “3,1”, – an updated version with a smaller chip was added later with the model number changed to “3.2”.Meanwhile, a commenter on MacRumors has talked about the possibility of these new models being new iPad Mini with Retina Display with an upgraded speaker unit. There were some complaints about the volume levels on the iPad Minis soon after their launch. Here is an Apple Discussions Forum thread discussing the same issue.Anyway, at this point of time, we can only guess as to what these “new” iPad models would turn out to be. Why then don’t you guys let us know what you think this would be? Do you see a new iPad model being launched very soon?[Image Via: MacRumors]All content © 2008 - 2018 The Inquisitr.	Science
677	"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againThe update brings improvements to the fingerprint scanner and some tweaks to Siri to deliver a more Australian twang.Apple has released an update to iOS, bringing the latest version to 7.1. There are bug fixes and usability tweaks, including an update to Siri that gives the personal assistant a distinctly Australian voice.This is the first major update to the operating system since iOS 7 was released in September 2013. The look and feel of the interface is maintained, but there are some tweaks to elements like button shapes and animations.Siri gets some of the meaty updates, including ""more natural"" male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English and Japanese. In iOS 7.1, users can also hold down the home button while they talk to Siri and release it when done, so it knows when you have stopped talking. Previously, Siri would interpret a pause in the conversation as indication that you had finished speaking.For iTunes Radio, Apple's music-streaming service, a search field above the featured stations section lets you create stations based on an artist or song, while buying albums with one press is now possible, rather than only buying a single.iOS 7.1 also brings Apple's CarPlay to the fore, giving users the ability to use their iPhone to power a touchscreen display in selected vehicles.The fingerprint reader should be more accurate than before, with faster response times. There is also a new camera setting that will automatically activate HDR photography on the iPhone 5s. Plus, users of the older iPhone 4 should see performance improvements.The full list of updates can be found on Apple's support site. iOS 7.1 is available now across compatible devices through iTunes or over the air.Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic.

679	IT STARTED with simply your phone, but now smartphone software makers are going to be battling it out for your new car.Finally, an easy to use car infotainment system.Source:SuppliedACCORDING to the Radio Advertising Bureau, radio advertising in the United States topped $16 billion in 2012. While it was much bigger before the expansion of cable television and the advent of digital, it’s still a thriving, profitable business.That said, the success of radio in the US is (and always has been) inextricably linked to the automotive industry. If radios were not in cars, the radio business would be a small fraction of its current size, were it to exist at all. This is interesting because the automotive industry does not profit from the radio business in any way. How would you feel if your business drove a $16 billion business and you didn’t make a dime from it?You may argue that the automotive industry doesn’t profit from the oil industry or road construction and literally hundreds of other related industries. You’d be right, of course, but with other industries the ship has sailed. With the advent of connected drivers, the automotive industry can make sure that history does not repeat itself.The mission is clear: figure out how to get drivers to log in to their cars.This is harder to do than it sounds. After all, you already have a powerful cloud-connected computer in your pocket. Why do you need to log in to the car? Detroit’s strategy is to offer drivers an integrated, enhanced experience so compelling that logging in to the car becomes a requirement. Connected drivers give carmakers the opportunity to interact with drivers in many ways, such as the following:In-car entertainment (radio, audio, video, games)Access to and egress from the vehicle (seats, mirrors, heat, door locks, trunk)Way-finding (enhanced GPS, cartography and mapping)Vehicle service (needs analysis, appointments, locations)Personal preferences (memory, intelligence, learning)Connected living features (social networks, email, txt, apps)Driver safety (inter-vehicle communication)Vehicle movement (traffic jam avoidance, parking space reservations)Interfaces with other modes of transportation (railroad, airline schedules)What if my car (a computer with wheels) were as easy to operate as an iPhone or a Mac?As you probably know, iOS 7 is the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system (the software that makes an iPhone work). CarPlay is iOS 7 on your dashboard. Apple says it designed CarPlay from the ground up to “provide drivers with an incredible experience using their iPhone in the car.”As you also probably know, Apple spends as much time searching the thesaurus for superlatives to describe its products as it does making them, so discount “incredible experience” appropriately.An iPod built into your car.Source:SuppliedAccording to Apple, you’ll be able to control CarPlay in a few ways. Compatible vehicles will have a dedicated voice-control button on the steering wheel. Apple says that “if it controls your screen, it controls CarPlay,” meaning you’ll be able to use the physical knobs and dials (as well as touch and voice) to interact with your iPhone.The whole system is built around Siri. Through voice commands and prompts, CarPlay offers an “eyes-free” experience that lets you answer calls, send text messages and access your music library. (That includes iTunes Radio as well as Spotify, Beats Radio, iHeartRadio and Stitcher.) CarPlay also supposedly knows where you want to go, based on addresses found in your email, texts, contacts and calendars — a little creepy, but cool. Welcome to the future!Let’s hope it doesn’t get you lost.Source:SuppliedCarPlay prominently features Apple’s Maps app, which got off to a very rocky start but has since improved. Use of Apple Maps has skyrocketed in recent months, which helps create a better map experience for everyone using it. But, to be frank, Apple Maps are not Google Maps. While this won’t matter in densely populated, well-trafficked areas, it is sure to yield interesting results in others.The first cars to support CarPlay come from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, and were all shown off at last week’s Geneva Motor Show. Other companies, including Nissan, BMW and General Motors, are promising to integrate CarPlay into future vehicles. The rumour mill says that Ford is interested in adding CarPlay into its vehicles, too, even after recent reports suggested it was dropping Microsoft’s Sync systems in favour of BlackBerry.You will be able to grab CarPlay from these manufacturers.Source:SuppliedWhen Can I Use It?CarPlay is available as of this morning, following an iOS 7 update. Only the most recent iPhones — the 5, 5S and 5C — will be compatible with the system at first. There’s no launch date other than 2014.Apple is not the first to unveil an in-car system, and it won’t be the last.

680	by Blair Hanley Frank on March 10, 2014 at 3:31 pmMarch 10, 2014 at 3:33 pmApple dropped iOS 7.1, its first major update to the operating system that powers iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches everywhere today, and it’s a big one.While support for CarPlay, Apple’s new system that allows people to use certain functions from their iPhone in a new car, has earned top billing in a lot of headlines, it requires that users buy new model cars that haven’t been released to consumers yet. So, while we wait for the first generation of CarPlay-ready vehicles, here are 5 more key new features from today’s update:Anyone who has tried to use Siri knows that while the virtual assistant is pretty good at picking out a user’s voice from background noise, it can have trouble figuring out when someone is done talking. I’ve definitely had experiences when it’ll ask me if I’m ready to send a text message I’m dictating while I’m in mid-sentence.With today’s update, ensuring that Siri keeps listening is a lot easier. Like before, users hold down the home button on their device to invoke Siri. But, if they continue to hold down the home button while they’re talking, Siri will keep listening until they release the home button again. That way, users aren’t left with abridged messages.For Touch ID users, Siri will now automatically unlock their iPhone if necessary while their finger is pressed down on the home button. That way, saying something like “Open Safari” will automatically open the app rather than ask users to unlock their phone first.While Apple has included High Dynamic Range (HDR) functionality in the built-in iOS Camera app for a while, today’s update brings some new functionality for shutterbugs using the iPhone 5S. HDR combines the results of multiple photographs at different exposure settings to create highly detailed photos, even in very bright or very dark environments.In the past, users were required to turn HDR on and off manually, which was great for photographers who knew exactly what they wanted and how to get it, but harder on amateurs who didn’t know what the best uses for HDR might be, or even what it did in the first place.Now, iPhone 5S users can set their phone up to automatically shoot in HDR. Like automatically using a flash, the iPhone’s camera software will automatically take a HDR picture if the situation calls for it, and will switch it off when that’s not necessary.One of Apple’s major additions to its music ecosystem last year was iTunes Radio, which brought everyone with an Apple ID the ability to create their own personalized digital radio stations similar to offerings from Pandora.Now, it’s easier to create a station on the fly. Apple added a search box over the featured iTunes Radio stations that allows users to search for an artist, genre, album or song and create a station to listen to in a single tap.Unfamiliar with iTunes Radio? Check out our review of streaming radio services here.It’s no secret that Apple’s built-in Calendar app for iOS isn’t the greatest. But, for people who are interested in taking a broad view at what their month holds, Apple has added a new calendar view that allows users to tap on a day in a month and look at a list of all their appointments.I’ve found that it’s great for trying to schedule something a few weeks in advance: month views in most mobile calendars will often show that I’m busy on a particular day, but not necessarily when I’m busy. With Apple’s new view, it’s fairly easy for me to figure out what my schedule looks like even if I’m a month away from whenever an event might be taking place.For users who have trouble with iOS 7’s motion-heavy animations, Apple has finally updated the settings app to replace all of the pans and zooms with gentle cross-fade animations. To turn it on, go to the Settings app, then toggle the switch on under General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion.So, there you have it: 5 great features from Apple’s new update to iOS.

One of the questions I get asked most – at least since I took over running TmoNews – is “when does [insert Android device name] get KitKat?”. Thankfully, with iPhone, it’s never really an issue. Once the software update is out, it’s out for everyone.Earlier this afternoon, Apple released version 7.1 of its iOS software. As for what’s new, here’s the full list on Apple’s website. They include CarPlay – a new in-car system that takes over certain manufacturers’ central consoles. It also has a new method of controlling Siri and a host of small user interface changes.Obviously, I’ve been covering the update for TodaysiPhone.com. For those wanting to see the main changes, I published a short overview video below.Let us know how you like the update. Does it improve your iPhone’s performance at all? What do you make of the new Siri control method?Tags: Apple, iOS, iOS 7.1, iPhone, News/Articles, Software Updatesknew about it five hours ago. you should of told us earlier instead you posted it on your precious TIP webpage first . if your gonna be in charge of two websites i suggest you post more news on T-Mobile and less on Todays Iphone since no one goes on thereOh good grief. Some people still have a hard time accepting the rise of David  to bigger and better things “guest” sadly is one of those people.I just have a hard time with the “instant gratification” mentality our society has gotten into. Seems common sense to me that the TiP website would be updated before TmoNews but again, that’s just me. Bottom line, for me anyway, is the OP got the news. And 5 whole hours than we did. Yay! /sarcasmI am definitely pro-David but this constant beating up of Cam is getting so, so old. The guy just can’t seem to win no matter what he does.I agree all he did was take up the mantle to keep this site going. Sad the venom people are unleashing upon him.Wow! Five whole hours! Woe be you. Seriously, if this is the worst thing that happened to you today, you probably had a better day than 99.95% of the world’s population.Now now settle down David, please don’t troll your old tmo blog, stay classy mate. David would never do such things. And besides, he’s got a big job at T-Mobile now. He doesn’t have time to troll.So that’s where he went.That isn’t David he poured his heart and soul into this site to make it what it became. And given the job he did why would he come back under a guest account to disparage Cam.We don’t care if you downloaded it earlier than Cam reported it.Calm yourself and go do something productive.Downloaded and using. Thanks Cam. Unlike the whiner below me, I dont run my life based on when you post things. downloaded thanksI been having the same error updating :( 9006 error, guess the serves are overloaded.Jailbreakers unite. Don’t update!sure, let me miss features for the 7 tweaks that work for my 5s, and then on top of that I can’t use my phone to demo at work! Thanks!so instead of making SIRI easier to use you have to do more and hold down the home button thats annoyingoptional. I will sometimes do it that way as Siri in loud situations will usually listen way longer than she should. The old way of releasing when you hear the tone works just as well.I don’t know if it is new or not, but I could never get iCloud Keychain to work before. With 7.1 I was able to finally get it working and saving my passwords.And while David sleeps, KitKat has been released for TMo S4 phones.Good job Cam posted an article about it here earlier ;-)Okay, I know I’m gonna get a lot of crap for this, but here it goes. I just downloaded 7.1 and it’s already managed to mess up my album art…songs play just fine, but pictures are all messed up. Made an appointment with Apple for tomorrow…I knew I should have held outBattery dying faster than ever. Going back to gs4. Eff this iPhone. Thank God Apple didn’t let carriers get involved in their update process.  I can’t imagine the crap T-Mobile would pull if they were able to insert themselves into the approval process.Or AIO.Everything much faster and smoother on my iPhone 5S now.  Also haven’t experienced any crashes so far.  This is what iOS 7 should’ve been like originally.I dont see this mention here so, if you have an iPhone 4 and stuck on ios7.0.x because you dont have the shshblobs saved for 6.x.x downgrading, update now. 7.1 makes the iPhone 4 sooooooo much faster. Although not as fast as ios6 it does give the iphone4 some more life.If you are jailbroken and want to stay that way, or want to jailbreak your iPhone, stay away from this update.Great video demonstration, Cam.  Thanks for posting.  I’ve got an old iPhone4 and 7.1 does seem to work a little better, and I love some of those newer features.Select the amount of total data you need for the entire plan.For example, if you need 2 lines with 1 GB of data each, you would select 2 GB of data with the data slider below."

Apple have this morning released iOS 7.1 for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Featuring a refined UI, faster animations, major bug fixes, CarPlay support, and improved responsiveness on some older devices, it’s a welcome update that finally brings back some of the snappiness we lost with iOS 7.The full changelog includes:The update is available via the Settings app, and users should be automatically notified of the update in the coming days.http://tgau.co/1kIbIM1Apple iPad, Apple TV, iOS, iOS 7, iOS 7.1, iPhone© Reawaken Media, LLC.

684	"March 10, 2014iOS 7.1 is here, and while it doesn’t look drastically different from iOS 7.0, it addresses many of the complaints that people had about its predecessor. Here’s a quick tour of some of the tweaks, changes, and additions we’ve spotted in our adventures with iOS 7.1 so far. We’ll add to this list as we find more things.The keyboard get a new-ish look in iOS 7.1, but you may have to look closely for it. In iOS 7.1, keyboard lettering is heavier than it had been on 7.0, and the background is a slightly cooler shade of gray. The Shift key gets a new look, too: When Shift is on in 7.1, the key turns white with a black arrow. In 7.0, the key remained gray, but gained a dark gray arrow.iOS 7.1 slightly tones down the green icons for the Messages and Phone apps. The rest of the bundled app icons are largely unchanged, but eagle-eyed readers might also notice that the icon labels are slightly lower relative to the icon they’re associated with in iOS 7.1.(What, you didn’t notice it? Some iOS user you are. :P )iOS 7’s borderless buttons caused…just a little bit of a stir among the user interface design community. And for good reason—some buttons may be hard to distinguish from mere text labels, particularly if you have a vision impairment (like colorblindness) or are just unfamiliar with iOS. iOS 7.1 gives you the option to re-add borders to buttons: Open the Settings app then go to General > Accessibility,  then toggle the Button Shapes setting to the on position. The button shapes aren’t pretty, but they work.iOS 7’s animations aren’t for everyone. For some, they’re annoying. For others, they actually cause motion sickness. Previous versions of iOS 7 could reduce some of the motion effects, but as Macworld points out, iOS 7.1 takes it a step further by optionally disabling additional visual effects, such as the scrolling effect in the Messages app and the cloud animations in the Weather app.Open to the Settings app, then proceed to General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion to make sure that you don’t lose your lunch over zooming icons. Unfortunately, you can’t turn off only certain effects while keeping others.It’s a small thing (as are all of these—noticing a pattern?), but the “Slide to unlock” text on the lock screen is darker and a bit more obvious under iOS 7.The dialer screen in the Phone app gets a minor update in iOS 7.1: Instead of a rectangular button labelled “Call,” you now get a circular button with a phone receiver icon (how quaint). The top bar that displays the number you’re calling gets a slight update too. (Note that the iOS 7 screenshot above is from an iPhone 4 so the proportions may be different from what you’ll see on an iPhone 5/5C/5S, but the basic layout should be the same.)

For those of you with iOS devices, Apple has released iOS 7.1 via over-the-air update today. This new rev of the OS adds a few new features and, most notably in my view, attempts to fix some problems introduced with iOS 7.  There's a list of changes here on Apple's website.  Listed first is the new ""CarPlay"" feature for automotive control integration, which is a nice upgrade for those with compatible touchscreens in their cars, I suppose.
To me, the biggest changes have to do with the UI and performance.  iOS 7 was a big and necessary change, but it lacked the sort of polish for which Apple was known under the tyranny of Mr. Jobs.  As a result, iOS 7.1 looks to fix some rather obvious problems, most of them filed under the bland, final bullet point in the release notes: ""Continued user interface refinements.""
For instance, Cyril's first reaction was relief that the slider to unlock an iPhone when you receive a call has been tweaked so the touch target area is larger, making a swipe-to-unlock motion easier and more reliable.
My top improvements have to do with iOS 7's swanky UI animations: they now happen faster and appear to be smoother on older hardware.  This fact, combined with some other apparent optimizations, has iOS 7.1 running appreciably faster on my third-gen iPad.  I essentially stopped using that system after the iOS 7 update and even refused to sell it to my brother because it was too sluggish.  This update has been an awful long time in coming, but it does seem to restore the performance I'd enjoyed under iOS 6.  In fact, 7.1 feels faster than 7.0.x even after disabling the ""reduced motion"" accessibility option.
iOS 7 was by all accounts horribly sluggish on the iPhone 4. Fortunately, the 7.1 update has specifically been tuned to run faster on that older device. Ars has the first write-up I've seen on iPhone 4 performance in iOS 7.1, and it looks like things are better, if not as snappy as iOS 6.
I'd say this update probably puts Apple on equal footing with the latest version of Android in most important ways.  I'm just not sure why they keep building devices with so little RAM onboard while pushing the envelope on SoC performance and software multitasking support.  The iPad Air is a great system, but it's RAM-poor. Right now, the bargain-priced Nexus 7 2013 edition still seems like a smarter mix of resources for everyday usability.

This update has been an awful long time in coming, but it does seem to restore the performance I'd enjoyed under iOS 6.  In fact, 7.1 feels faster than 7.0.x even after disabling the ""reduced motion"" accessibility option.iOS 7 was by all accounts horribly sluggish on the iPhone 4. Fortunately, the 7.1 update has specifically been tuned to run faster on that older device. Ars has the first write-up I've seen on iPhone 4 performance in iOS 7.1, and it looks like things are better, if not as snappy as iOS 6.I'd say this update probably puts Apple on equal footing with the latest version of Android in most important ways.  I'm just not sure why they keep building devices with so little RAM onboard while pushing the envelope on SoC performance and software multitasking support.  The iPad Air is a great system, but it's RAM-poor. Right now, the bargain-priced Nexus 7 2013 edition still seems like a smarter mix of resources for everyday usability.Tags:            Mobile computing

689	"Apple released a new update to its latest operating system, iOS 7, in a Monday update that marks the first major changes Apple's made to the system in the six months since it made its debut. The update adds support for Apple's new connected car service, CarPlay, and also fixes some bugs such as one that was making some users' home screens crash.The update isn't huge — nothing like the complete cosmetic overhaul that Apple unleashed when it first showed off iOS 7 — but it does include several small changes that you'll probably notice right away. For one, the colors are little more muted, for better contrast. Plus, certain animations, such as the screen when you get an incoming call, look a little different.Diving a little deeper into the update, Apple has added some tweaks to the Calendar, which lets users look at a list of their events for the month, and has also improved the recognition technology behind its Touch ID fingerprint reader.The firm has also made some changes to Siri, making it possible for users to hold down the home button the entire time they talk to the virtual assistant, and then release it to have the phone stop listening. It's an option, but a good usability tweak for those who want it. Users can also choose more ""natural-sounding"" options for Siri in UK English, Australian English, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.Apple has also made a tweak to its iTunes Radio feature, including one that lets you buy albums from the ""Now Playing"" feature rather than just singles.And finally, for shutterbugs, Apple has also included an update just for iPhone 5s users that will automatically turn on the high-dynamic range, or HDR, feature when needed rather than making you toggle the feature yourself.The update is rolling out to users now. To check for it, you can go to the ""General"" menu of your Settings app, and click on ""Software Update.""Apple  did have to release a mini-update to iOS 7 last month to address a security flaw in its mobile devices."

690	"Apple has released iOS 7.1, an update for the iPhone and iPad operating system that includes CarPlay and improvements to Siri.Chief among the additions is CarPlay, Apple's car infotainment system announced last week. iPhone 5s, 5c and 5 owners with cars that support CarPlay will be able to use the feature.The update also fixes a bug that has come to be known as the ""black/white screen of death"", which caused some Apple iOS devices to randomly crash and restart.Apple has given users more control over how long Siri will listen to a user. Previously, users held down the home button to activate Siri, but now they can continue holding the home button until they are done speaking so Siri won't cut them off. Siri has also been given new, ""more natural"" voices in Australian English, UK English, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.Design changes include darkening some colours and making it more obvious where to press buttons. The function for answering calls was also tweaked, and a list of events added to the month view in the Calendar app.For owners of the iPhone 5s, Apple made some improvements to the TouchID fingerprint sensor so the device works more quickly and reliably. Some users had complained the fingerprint sensor often took multiple attempts to verify their identity.iPhone 5s users also have a new camera setting that automatically enables HDR (high-dynamic-range) mode.Additionally, Apple said the update will improve how iOS 7 performs on the iPhone 4 and older versions of the iPad. The software previously ran slowly on the iPhone 4, but the update should make it feel faster, Apple said.Users will also no longer have to clear their FaceTime notifications from their gadgets when they answer a call on another device. Apple said these notifications will now clear automatically.In September last year, Apple rolled out iOS 7, the biggest overhaul of the mobile-operating system used by millions of iPhone and iPad owners. The system was revamped after design head Jony Ive took over from former software chief Scott Forstall in 2012.To download iOS 7.1, users can head to their Settings app, tap ""General"" then ""Software Update"".

692	Posted on March 10, 2014 in MobileApple has released iOS 7.1, the latest version of the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads. In addition to fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, it provides several interesting new features.iOS 7.1 formally introduces CarPlay, Apple’s new vehicular infotainment system for new cars in 2014. With CarPlay, Apple is making a bid to become the de facto auto-intelligence system—one that provides navigation by Apple Maps, music via iTunes and touchless access to phone calls, apps like Spotify and messaging through the Siri virtual assistant. See also: Apple’s iOS 7.1 Update Can’t Come Soon Enough, Because The Bugs Are Piling UpCarPlay will be shipped in cars from Volvo, Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai and Mercedes this year with partners like BMW, Chevrolet and Ford down the road. Here are six other things you need to know about iOS 7.1:The Siri virtual assistant has been upgraded so you can signal it when you’re done speaking. Hold down the Home button on your iPhone or iPad when speaking and release it so Siri stops listening. Essentially, Apple has given Siri walkie-talkie capabilities.iOS 7.1 brings a couple of design tweaks to the flat design that Apple first rolled out in iOS 7. Users can now switch between light and dark keyboards through the “Accessibility” settings. Several icons are more defined, such as the Message, Phone and FaceTime app icons. Users can disable or minimize the 3D-ish “parallax” effect, in which the screen background appears to shift as you move the phone.iPhone 5S users get new settings in iOS 7.1. HDR (high dynamic range) will turn on automatically for iPhone 5S users. HDR basically makes the camera app take several pictures at different exposures and then composites them together in order to create a sharper final image.Many users have complained that the Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5S stops working well after a few months of use. This is partly a hardware problem, but also a software issue. In iOS 7.1, Apple has improved the Touch ID software to be more accurate, leading to quicker response times fewer rejections. Let us know in the comments if the update to Touch ID improves the performance on your iPhone 5S.The oldest Apple device that can run iOS 7.1 is the iPhone 4. Many users complained that the iPhone 4 was basically unusable with iOS 7 and took Apple to task for basically turning their phones into shiny bricks. In iOS 7.1, Apple promises improved performance for the iPhone 4 with better responsiveness. It may be a small change, but Apple updated the way its calendar app displays events in “Month View” with the aim of making them more accessible and readable.Have you downloaded iOS 7.1 yet? What changes do you see to Apple’s latest update? Let us know in the comments. Updated on March 12 to clarify the language and fix typos. Also, an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when HDR was introduced to the iPhone; it first appeared in iOS 4.1.

693	"Apple has announced the release of iOS 7.1, the newest version of its mobile software for iPhones and iPads. The release comes little less than six months after the radically redesigned iOS 7 arrived back in September 2013.Like iOS 7, its latest iteration is compatible with the iPhone 4 and subsequent models, the iPad 2 and its subsequent variants (including the iPad Mini line-up), and not to mention, the 5th generation iPod Touch models. Like all software updates, this one too boasts of a plethora of bug fixes, design tweaks and feature additions. Let us take a quick look at what’s new with iOS 7.1.CarPlayInitially showcased at the Geneva Auto Show earlier this month, CarPlay was formerly known as “iOS in the Car”. It has made its official debut as CarPlay with iOS 7.1. This basically is a tool that will let your iPhone and its software seamlessly integrate with your in-car infotainment system. Apart from handling mundane things like making and answering calls using voice command, it will also help you with navigation, messaging and music. Apple has made the UI as intuitive as possible to ensure that the driver is not distracted from his primary job of driving. As you might have guessed, this requires car manufacturers to join hands with Apple, and some of them have actually done that. Car manufacturers who now support CarPlay include Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. A host of other players are set to enter the fray in the coming months. CarPlay is of course powered by Siri.SiriTalking about Siri brings me to the fact that with iOS 7.1, she would sound a lot natural – thanks to addition of a plethora of natural-sounding voices for U.K. English, Australian English, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese languages. The biggest addition however is perhaps the new push-to-talk mode whereby users can hold the home button to fine tune the duration of your query for Siri.CameraThe major update that iOS 7.1 to the camera software is the addition of an HDR Auto mode.CalendarFor office going iOS users who have been missing the “list view” within month view, it has returned! Also finding its way in is country specific holidays list that shows up depending on where your iPhone is located.iTunes RadioYou can now buy albums from within iTunes Radio – a feature that wasn’t available when the software first arrived with iOS 7.Touch IDImprovements have also been made to the Touch ID biometric reader, making the fingerprint recognition bit even better with iOS 7.1How to Download
Wondering how to get this latest version of iOS? All you need to do is to navigate to the Settings menu on your iOS device, go to the “General” section and then to the “Software Update” menu. You should be able to see an option to upgrade the software over-the-air. In case you do not see an update listed, you may also try connecting the device to either a Mac or a PC and update to iOS 7.1 using iTunes.by selecting the “Check for Upgrade” button in your device’s summary window. Note that you might want to use your Wi-Fi connection for the software download as it is a large file.Used iOS 7.1 already? How did you find the new improvements?

694	"CNET – Apple on Monday released an update to its iOS 7 mobile operating system — iOS 7.1 — that adds new features such as CarPlay and fixes bugs.With iOS 7.1, Apple also tweaked its Siri voice assistant, iTunes Radio, and its Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The company streamlined the operating system to make it work better with the iPhone 4, made some user interface refinements, and included some stability and accessibility improvements.The update is available immediately, and the Apple devices will alert users about it over the next week.iOS 7.1 marks the first major update following Apple’s release of iOS 7 about six months ago. Apple initially unveiled iOS 7 at its developer conference in June of last year and released the operating system in September. The software underwent a complete design overhaul, with everything from the typography and color schemes getting an update. iOS 7 also added useful features like automatic updates to make everyday use easier, AirDrop, and iTunes Radio, as well as a new control center that gives quick access to most-used features. Since the introduction of iOS 7, Apple had released five beta updates of iOS 7.1 to developers.About 83 percent of Apple device users have downloaded iOS 7, Apple said. The operating system won’t run on the original iPad from 2010 and any iPhones older than the iPhone 4.Apple streamlined functions in iOS 7.1 to make the experience faster for iPhone 4 users, which have a much less advanced chip than Apple’s newest phones and tablets.With iOS 7, Siri recognized that a user was done talking because the person paused for a couple of seconds. Now, users can hold down the home button the entire time they’re talking to Siri. Once they lift their finger, Siri knows they’re done talking. Both ways of interacting are available in iOS 7.1. Apple also included new male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, British English, Australian English, and Japanese.iTunes Radio also got some tweaks. There’s a new search field that allows users to create stations based on their favorite songs or artists. Users can buy albums with a single tap from iTunes Radio, rather than only buying singles. And for the first time, users can now subscribe to iTunes Match from their mobile devices rather than from the desktop.To read the rest of this story on CNET’s website, click here.Filed in: News Really?

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Apple on Monday announced an update to its mobile operating system to fix bugs, improve Siri and fingerprint-reading technology, and add new features such as CarPlay.iOS 7.1 is the first major update since iOS 7, which was released last September. Users can now control how long Siri listens to them by holding down the home button for the desired time. iPhone 5s owners can set their phone to take “high dynamic range” photos. The new operating system also has an updated interface, with smaller, rounder icons.Available for iPhone 5, the CarPlay phone integration system will allow drivers to make calls, get directions, or play music from their iPhone using the car’s built-in display. It can be controlled using voice or touch. CarPlay will be available in select 2014 vehicles, including some models from Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Ferrari.Apple says the new update fixes an occasional Home screen crash bug for iPhone 5S users.

We know that the new features are not going to make you stand back in amazement, but there are several features that have been demanded by users.One of those much-needed features is the ability to hide unnecessary channel icons from the home screen, this was possible before, but you had to go into the Parental Controls menu first. This added feature allows you to customize your Apple TV even more.How to arrange or hide icons – This is a very simple process because all you need to do is go to the main menu, press and hold the Select button on the remote until you see the icons jiggle like they do on your iPhone or iPad, you can then move these icons with the directional buttons.There are more options available, which can be accessed with the Play/Pause button.In order to download the latest Apple TV OS you will need to go to Settings, then General and Software Update.

According to Apple, about 82 percent of all compatible iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch devices are running iOS 7 as of late February, based on App Store data.As many millions have waited to upgrade until some of the known and well-documented bugs and user interface flaws have been resolved, that figure is expected to rise significantly in the next days.For those not able to download over-the-air, Windows and Mac users can alternatively connect their compatible iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch devices to iTunes, and upgrade by selecting the ""Check for Upgrade"" button in their device's summary window. Or, users can download the software bundle (.IPSW) files from Apple's website for offline installations in the coming hours. (Enterprise users can use Apple's Phobos server for download links.) In past updates, downloads are often slow at first as millions attempt to upgrade at the same time.Downloading over a Wi-Fi connection is recommended due to the size of the file, and some users may have to delete content from their devices in order to install.MobilityPixelbook, Nintendo Switch, and electric cars in space (MobileTechRoundup show #422)iPhoneHere's how iOS 11.3 handles an iPhone crash due to a bad batteryHardwareApple's TV app for iOS: Now you can watch new 'live news' channelsAppleIt's time to dump those old iPhones and iPads© 2018 CBS Interactive.

699	In today’s release of the first major update after iOS 7 back in September, seems like Apple has pushed this update to two unannounced models of iPad. The latest iOS 7.1 update shows the compatible devices including iPad 4,3 and iPad 4,6. Both of these iPad models have never been announced by Apple. Seems like Apple has some devices running for house use or perhaps under testing. These new iPad models indicate an upgraded Retina Mini iPad and a new iPad Air model. iPad 4,1 and 4,2 are the digits for iPad Air. So it seems like 4,3 could be the digits for modified iPad Air. On the other hands, Apple iPad Retina Mini carries 4,4, and 4,5 indicating that iPad 4,6 could correspond to a new Retina iPad mini.While specifics of these models are yet unknown, it would be interesting to see what is cooking down at Cupertino. It is highly possible that these digits correspond to same iPad Air and Retina Mini models but just kept for internal use. These could only be numbers for some specific region. Another possibility could be that Apple is testing better performance, efficient battery usage, and new tweaks on these devices. Whatever the reason be, we would be on the hunt to see what exactly these iPad 4,3 and iPad 4,6 models carry in them!Stay tuned!– Relevant updates and news:	Science

As expected, Apple has released an updated version of its mobile operating system just one day before the annual iTunes Festival kicks off for the first time ever at SXSW. iOS 7.1 includes a number of new features, interface tweaks and bug fixes for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch as outlined below.
	Arriving roughly six months after the launch of iOS 7, the first major update includes support for CarPlay. Formerly known as the iOS in the car initiative, Apple unveiled CarPlay a week ago during the Geneva Motor Show with support from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo.

	Apple also improved the Touch ID fingerprint recognition system found on the iPhone 5s. Elsewhere, users can now control how long Siri listens for voice commands by simply holding down the Home button as you speak. The personal assistant also received improved voices in Mandarin Chinese, Australian English, UK English and Japanese which are said to sound more natural.
	New accessibility options include a bold font option for the keyboard, calculator and many icons, the ability to reduce motion in Weather, Messages and multitasking UI animations and the ability to darken app colors and reduce white point.

	In a somewhat rare move for the Cupertino-based company, they’ve published a full page that outlines all of the new features in iOS 7.1 that can be seen by clicking here.
	iOS 7.1 is compatible with the iPhone 4 and newer as well as the iPad 2 and later and the 5th generation iPod touch. To grab the update over-the-air, simply navigate to “Software Update” under the “General” section in the setting’s menu.

704	"After a long bout of beta testing, Apple has released the iOS 7.1 update to the general public. This is the first major update for iOS 7 since it was released this past September.7.1 brings a host of new features, from updated icons to an improved keyboard and phone dialer. If you've been waiting for CarPlay, formerly known as iPhone in the Car, you're in luck. iOS 7.1 brings the service to vehicles for the first time, creating an ""eyes-free"" experience that utilizes Siri's voice controls for accessing music, responding to incoming calls, and dictating text messages.Users can look forward to new manual controls for Siri that allow you to hold down the Home button while you speak and release it when you're done, instead of letting Siri figure out when you're done speaking. Calendar has added the option to display events in month view, along with new country-specific holidays.The update also improves iTunes Radio, enabling iTunes Match subscriptions directly from the device and introducing a new Search field above the Featured Stations listing for easier station creation. And, as usually happens with major updates, iOS 7.1 disables the jailbreak exploits hackers discovered in iOS 7.To update, simply head to your ""software update"" tool item in Settings > General > Software Update on your device, plug in your phone or tablet, and turn on your WiFi. You'll be all set in no time!That's within 6 months after the official launch.The company's maps and directions keep getting better.It helps you feel temperature and pressure, but it can also take damage.It's free, if you have a cable subscription.A new study shows much higher error rates for people who aren't white or male."

708	"Apple on Monday released an updated version of its mobile operating system, iOS 7.1, and it comes with several noticeable changes over the previous release, as well as a few differences that won't be apparent unless you know to enable them. Many of the physical alterations smooth out the design leap that iOS users experienced when jumping from iOS 6 to iOS 7, which introduced the so-called flat design and parallax effects. A few of the changes in iOS 7.1, such as how some Web pages display in Safari, are more behind-the-scenes for programmers and won't be apparent to users until developers leverage them.But these six changes are worth investigating. Here's a few words about them, as well as where you can find them.Phone and FaceTime Answering Options
Incoming phone calls and FaceTime requests look a little different in iOS 7.1. Buttons shaped like rounded rectangles move to the wayside to make room for circles. The buttons for ""remind me"" and ""reply with message"" look completely different now, almost played down compared with their blocky past versions.Where: On screen when a phone call or FaceTime call comes in.Shift and Caps Lock Indicators
The shift key on iOS's virtual keyboard now uses new icons to indicate when it is not engaged (white key, black arrow), has been pressed once for a single keystroke (gray key, white arrow), and tapped twice to turn on caps lock (white key, black arrow with underline). In the image above, from left to right: shift not engaged; single cap shift; all caps.Where: On the keyboard.Siri Voices
With iOS 7.1, Siri should sound a little sweeter, or more masculine, depending on your taste. Siri now has both male and female voices for Australian English, British English, Japanese, and Mandarin, and they should sound better, too. The developer release notes state that your iPhone or iPad initially uses a ""compact voice for Siri,"" but that it will download and install a higher-quality version automatically once you connect to a Wi-Fi network and plug your device into a power source. I could hear the improvements most clearly in the Australian male voice.Where: Settings > General > SiriButton Shapes
When enabled, Button Shapes highlights buttons that otherwise look like text to better differentiate them. It makes iOS 7.1 look slightly less sophisticated and austere, but it makes the buttons pop for sure. In the image above, you can see the traditional view on the left, and the enhanced button shape on the right. Sometimes it takes the form of a simple underline instead of a gray box. I rather like a lot of the accessibility features in iOS because they often improve the experience without really getting in the way, and Button Shapes is one you can enable and forget you ever did. (For other useful accessibility features, try the reduce motion setting if iOS 7 makes you dizzy, and Guided Access to lock your screen while kids use your device.)Where: Settings > General > Accessibility > Button ShapesPerspective Zoom (Ability to Disable Parallax Effect for Wallpaper Only)
With iOS 7.1, you now have finer controls for disabling some of the visual effects within iOS 7. When you choose a wallpaper for your lock screen or home screen in iOS 7, you'll see an option to turn ""perspective zoom"" on or off. Turning it off disables the parallax effect (if you're still not totally sure what parallax effect is, scroll slowly through this BBC page, and you'll get it), without disabling the other animations, such as the zooming in and out of app preview pages when you double-tap the home button.Where: Settings > Wallpaper & Brightness (and then choose a wallpaper)Less Bouncy Control Center
It's not a huge change, but the quick-access control bar, which lets you adjust the screen brightness, adjust Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, etc., bounces less when you first engage it. The Control Center, which was entirely new as of iOS 7, formerly pulled up higher onto the screen and sprang back into place when you drew it beyond its capacity. Now, it locks into place quicker and more tightly. You still can't use it for location services (i.e., GPS), which has been on my wish list since iOS 7 debuted in 2013.Where: Control Center; use one finger near the bottom of the screen and swipe up.What to Expect at Google I/O 2015How to Get iOS 8

Apple iOS 7.1 has been released and is ready to use!  Apple users will find new features, visual changes, and fixed bugs that make the iOS experience better for the user.Should I Update To Apple iOS 7.1?  What Is New?An Apple iPad that will be able to download the new Apple iOS 7.1.The visual on the screen has changed when someone is receiving a call or powering off their iPhone.  Instead of the rectangular buttons that used to be displayed, the new iOS 7.1 uses circular buttons.  They have also made buttons larger in several screens.  The shuffle and repeat buttons are larger in the music app while the shift and delete keys are easier to see and larger on the keyboard.The iOS in the Car feature is now replaced by CarPlay.  CarPlay will be in the newest versions of Volvo, Ferrari, and Mercedes-Benz, as well as Ford and BMW eventually.  It allows the user to use Siri’s commands to respond to calls, text messages, or use the music app using their car.The old iOS had issues with some of Apple’s newer products where it  would randomly reboot randomly without warning from the user.  The fingerprint reader that is exclusive to the newest Apple iPhone 5s will now be faster and more accurate on the iPhone 5s.  This has been fixed along with updates for  anyone still using an iPhone 4 having faster running systems.Photo courtesy of Wikipedia.Should I Update To Apple iOS 7.1?  What Is New?"

710	AdvertisementAdvertisement By Lewis LeongMar 10, 2014ShareThe much anticipated iOS 7.1 update is now available for iPhone and iPad. The update brings tons of subtle improvements and CarPlay support.Older device users will be happy to know that iOS 7.1 improves performance for less powerful devices. Performance for the iPhone 4 is improved and we’ll be testing just how much faster it is very soon.iPhone 5s users will see TouchID finger print recognition improvements. 5S users will also get an auto-HDR mode.Siri can now be activated by holding down the home button and speaking. Release the button when you’re done speaking. This makes it faster than waiting for Siri to detect silence to know when you’re done speaking.Perhaps the most interesting part of iOS 7.1 is the addition of CarPlay support. Just a week after debuting the technology at the Geneva Motor Show, Apple has updated its devices to support the in-car operating system. Messages, Maps, Phone, and 3rd party music apps like Spotify are supported at launch. To see how CarPlay works, check out the video released by Volvo.To get the update, go to your device settings and General > Software Update. You should see an update waiting to be installed. The update is 214MB but you’ll need 1.9GB of free space on your device to be able to install it.Next storyHow to become a brand ambassador on InstagramAdvertisementAdvertisementShare Files - when it worksCompact BitTorrent client with expansive capabilitiesKeep internet-based attacks at bayThe quickest, smartest browserA Free Phone Manager, With An App Downloader, Manager And Installer PlatformAdobe Reader 11: the essential PDF viewerAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAbout UsDevelopersPartnersUsersSitemaps:Softonic in:The name and logo of Softonic are registered trademarks of SOFTONIC INTERNATIONAL S.A.Copyright SOFTONIC INTERNATIONAL S.A. © 1997-2018 - All rights reservedAdvertisementWe use own and third party cookies to improve our services and your experience.

717	March 10, 20144:29 PM EDTApple Inc. released an update to the software that powers the iPhone and iPad tablet, fixing bugs that caused some customers’ smartphones to crash and implementing some design changes.The release today, called iOS 7.1, adds features that will let drivers use iPhones in cars that will be available this year using Apple software. It also gives people new ways to access the Siri voice-recognition tool by holding down the device’s home button, the company said.Last year, Apple rolled out iOS 7, the biggest overhaul of the mobile-operating system used by millions of iPhone and iPad owners. The system was revamped after design head Jony Ive took over from former software chief Scott Forstall in 2012. Customers have complained that the new version doesn’t work consistently and is prone to crashing.The software is critical because it powers Apple’s two biggest products. The iPhone and iPad accounted for more than 70% of the Cupertino, California-based Apple’s revenue in its latest fiscal year.Some other design changes in the update include darkening some colours and making it more obvious where to press buttons. The function for answering calls was also tweaked.For owners of the iPhone 5S, the newest high-end version of the smartphone, Apple said it also made some improvements to the TouchID fingerprint-detection technology so the device works more quickly and reliably.Bloomberg.com	Science

Apple has made its iOS 7.1 update available for download, which is good news for many people around the world, but bad news for jailbreak fans.The latest iOS update fixes issues like random reboots occurring for no apparent reasons, and includes an improved call menu systemThe call menu now comes with updated buttons for declining or answering calls, messaging, or setting reminds, to make it harder for Apple users to press the wrong button.Other features include improvements to Siri and Touch ID, along with the release of Apple's new CarPlay service.If you've jailbroken your phone and wish to keep it jailbroken, don't update to iOS 7.1, as it's been designed to patch the vulnerability that resulted in the latest Evasi0n7 exploit.More bad news for users looking to jailbreak their devices after upgrading to the newest OS is that Evad3rs member ""Pod2g"" was recently quoted saying they won't focus on the next jailbreak as a team, and that they may save their efforts for the anticipated arrival of iOS 8.""If one day, I find myself bored and can put enough time and energy into it, I have some ideas for how to make (an iOS) 7.1 jailbreak,"" said the Evad3rs member, according to the International Digital Times.If you aren't concerned about jailbreaks and you're looking to update you device, simply go to the ""Settings"" option, click ""General,"" and then ""Software Update.""2018 BMW 520i And 525d Specs Reveal Four-Cylinder Engine & 6.6-Second Acceleration Rate2018 Mercedes-Benz S Class To Offer A New Kind Of Mobile Yoga System?Dallara’s New Sports CarIs Coming Out Soon!

722	By Peter Chubb  - Mar 10, 2014Having assumed that we might have to wait a little longer for the public release of iOS 7.1, we were surprised to see it released within the last hour or two. There are several key changes to Apple’s mobile OS, with one of them, CarPlay, targeted for drivers.CarPlay is one of the most notable features of iOS 7.1, which as many of you will know brings iOS integration to your car. You will now be able to gain access to Siri, use maps, as well as make calls, text and also listen to your music library.It is clear to see that Apple is trying to lure iOS users with CarPlay showcasing its convenience, but there are those who suggest that this comes at the price of safety. There are certain safety advocates who believe that Apple assumes that drivers spend all of their time on their phones.We can understand why people would be concerned about this, but there is already so much in a car that can distract a driver, and so this could be construed that these advocates are just trying to target the next victim, which just so happens to be Apple’s CarPlay.Autoblog says that Apple issued a press release saying that the use of CarPlay makes it far safer to interact with features of the iPhone because it minimizes distraction.At the end of the day it isn’t systems like this that causes the distraction, but rather the human element. The reason being is that you are not forced to use such systems all of the time, and when you choose to use them, you need to understand when the right moment will be.Follow us on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus.Also See: Apple iPhone, iPad subscription rumors in 2018	Science

724	"By Daniel Chubb  - Mar 10, 2014We have taken a quick look at iOS 7.1 vs. iOS 7 changes after reporting the update went live today, but one subtle difference we can see is with the iOS 7.1 keyboard that now seems a lot brighter on our iPad mini. We cannot confirm if this is the same on iPhone 5S, 5C, and other models but there’s certainly a change to the iPad keyboard.Luckily, we just took a screenshot of our iPad mini keyboard within iOS 7 and then again after installing the iOS 7.1 software. You can see both the screenshots without us making any changes other than adding a label for what version of iOS they were taken in.This screenshot reveals the duller looking keyboard we all know and have been using for weeks, then below that you will see the new iOS 7.1 keyboard with a change to brightness and a few other differences like font weight.Do you like the new keyboard after installing the iOS 7.1 software update? It is brighter, but do you like it more?Personally, I think the new iOS 7.1 keyboard looks clean but it is very bright in comparison. We also notice a speed improvement with the iPhone 5S after only using it for a few minutes, so we’d need more time to see if this lasts.It is worth noting that the differences between keyboards are far clearer on the iPhone/iPad screens and not as clear after uploading to this page, but trust us when we say there’s certainly a big brightness difference.What changes do you notice with iOS 7.1 vs. iOS 7? You can see the release notes via our earlier article. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus.Also See: Apple iPhone, iPad subscription rumors in 2018The stroke weight really threw me off, I thought I was having vision problems and had to research it to prove it had actually changed. thanks!Really, really hate it. I wish I couls have the original one back or white letters on a black background. When caps lock is activated I’d like the whole key to change color so I can see it! Now, it’s so confusing. Actually Apple should give us an option to keep what we already have or the new style. In other an OPTION. How hard could that be?
 It’s getting to the point that I don’t want to download any upgrades anymore. Hated what they did to the bookshelf too. They said it was a “beautiful new design”! Hah! It’s just another  plain WHITE background. If I’m lucky Mri I will run out of white paint at some point. And soon please!I dislike this new keyboard immensely, it disturbes my eyes and annoys me.  I much preferred the older keyboard, I do not need my letters to scream at me.  Ugh they give me eye strain! agreeUgh this new keyboard update looks so dated I hate it. It looked so nicely designed before!! Why did they change the font to be bolder, how do we petition for them to change it back? lol this is a bummer. The lower contrast in 7.1 makes the keys vibrate for me – very annoying!the font on the keyboard is now bolder which looks dated. iOs7 is very modern and the thinner keyboard prior to 7.1 was better fitting with iOs7I agree with you so much. It’s lame but I’m kinda bummed lol I switched from android and loved everything about my 5s, why are they raining on the awesomeness :/I hate the new iOS 7.1 keyboard. That font is horrible.“That Font” ? You mean, Helvetica. The worlds most perfect font.
LOL. You dolt.As you can see at the images on the top, iOS 7.1 Helvetica is bolder than iOS 7.0. When I see the new keyboard I feel like I was missing something. It’s if it had lost quality. I prefer iOS 6 or iOS 7 keyboard.And I disagree, I think Segoe UI, size 8, is more readable than Helvetica. Also, Helvetica (Light) it’s too thin for some screens (no retina) and it occupies a lot of space (for example in this comment).Thanks for your comment! 😀"	Science

727	After much anticipation by users of iOS devices such as the iPhone 5S and the iPad Air, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq:AAPL) released iOS 7.1 on Monday, adding several features to iOS 7.But iOS 7.1 also takes away one of the key unofficial “benefits” of iOS 7.0.6 and below -- jailbreaking using the Evasi0n 7 jailbreak tool developed by the Evad3rs development team.Throughout the development of iOS 7.1, jailbreak developers were paying close attention to the developer beta versions of iOS 7.1 released by Apple, looking for signs that Apple was patching key exploits used by Evasi0n 7.Unfortunately, the exploits used by Evasi0n 7 were closed in January, leaving jailbreak developers and users scrambling to update their iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches to the latest jailbreakable version of iOS 7.0.x before Apple finally patched the exploits used by Evasi0n 7.Fortunately, Apple held off on implementing its patches for exploits used by Evasi0n 7 as it released incremental iOS 7.0.x updates, including iOS 7.0.6.What does this mean for the state of the iOS jailbreak community?People currently running iOS 7.0 through iOS 7.0.6 jailbroken with Evasi0n 7 don’t have to do anything other than not updating to iOS 7.1 to keep their iOS device in a jailbroken state. Those currently running iOS 7.0 through 7.0.6 stock may still be able to jailbreak their device if it was updated through a restore or through non-over-the-air (OTA) iOS 7 update software.Whether or not the iOS jailbreak community will see another jailbreak for iOS 7.1 is anyone’s guess at this point. In addition to Apple patching several exploits used by Evasi0n 7, the P0sixspwn jailbreak released in December 2013 for iOS 6.1.3 through 6.1.5 reportedly “burned” a highly valuable exploit that jailbreaks were attempting to keep under wraps.In the meantime, iOS 7 users will have to stay on versions 7.0 through 7.0.6 in order to keep their devices jailbroken. Subscribe	Science
728	iOS 7.1 was released to the masses on Monday. Apple already published a changelog with most of the front-facing changes, like some UI tweaks, performance enhancements and CarPlay support, but there may be more to the story. iClarified noticed that Apple published firmware for two models of the iPad that don’t currently exist.The site found that iOS 7.1 supports several iPads, but that new software is available for two models — iPad 4,3 and iPad 4,6— that haven’t been discussed before. The most recent iPads, the iPad Air and iPad Mini with Retina display, are referred to as iPad 4,1 (iPad Air with Wi-Fi), iPad 4,2 (iPad Air with Wi-Fi and Cellular), the iPad 4,4 (iPad mini with Retina Wi-Fi) and the iPad 4,5 (iPad mini with Retina and Wi-Fi and Cellular).We don’t yet know what iPads these are, though the number scheme suggests there’s a variant of the iPad Air (4,3) and a variant of the iPad mini with Retina (4,6) that we haven’t seen yet. iClarified suggests it’s likely new models headed to China, and that makes the most sense to us. Either way, we aren’t looking at major overhauls.Todd Haselton has been writing professionally since 2006 during his undergraduate days at Lehigh University.

729	"Apple on Monday afternoon pushed out an update for its iOS mobile operating system, featuring support for the much-hyped CarPlay, improvements for Siri, Touch ID, and more.First unveiled last week, CarPlay is described in the update notes as an ""iOS experience designed for the car."" It lets you control your phone, music, maps, messages, and third-party audio apps with Siri or your car's ""touch screen, knobs, and buttons.""That is, if you have a CarPlay-enabled vehicle. The technology is making its debut in select cars shipping this year, including Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo. BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Land Rover, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Subaru, Suzuki, and Toyota customers will soon gain access as well, Apple said last week. For more, check out the slideshow below.The first major update to iOS 7 also makes Siri a little more lifelike thanks to ""more natural sounding"" male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese. You can also now manually control when the virtual personal assistant listens by holding down the home button while you speak and releasing it when you're done instead of just letting Siri automatically notice when you stop talking.Meanwhile, iPhone 5s  users should be happy to hear that Apple has improved Touch ID fingerprint recognition, though Cupertino did specify exactly how it is better. The company also fixed an issue that occasionally caused the home screen to crash.In iTunes Radio, there's a new Search field above Featured Stations, letting you create stations based on songs and artists. You can also now buy albums right from the Now Playing screen, and subscribe to iTunes Match on your mobile device to listen to iTunes Radio without ads.You'll also notice some changes to the calendar and camera. Country-specific holidays are now automatically added to the calendar for many countries, and you can now display events in month view. For mobile shutterbugs, there's a new setting to automatically enable HDR for the iPhone 5s.On the accessibility front, the bold font option now includes the keyboard calculator and many icon glyphs. In addition, Apple has expanded the ""reduce motion"" option, which addresses iOS 7-related motion sickness, to cover weather, messages, and other animations.The update requires at least 1.9GB of storage.

After a long time in testing, the final release of iOS 7.1 has today been made available to the masses.Apple has begun seeding the newest update to its iOS mobile operating system, version 7.1. Some of the most talked about features are now present, including CarPlay, but there are a host of smaller and subtler changes too. Here’s a rundown of what to look out for.Let’s get the things you can’t see out of the way first. In amongst the blanket term ‘bug fixes’ Apple has improved the user experience by enhancing the accuracy of the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, iPhone 4 users should notice slicker performance across the board and more countries will now be able to access iCloud Keychain.What’s more, Apple is hoping that this update has quelled the spontaneous reboot bug that some iPhone users were experiencing.Perhaps the most hotly anticipated part of the iOS 7.1 update is CarPlay, which works with select vehicles to allow for an iOS experience in your car. Manufacturers including Ferrari, Honda and Mercedes-Benz have already signed up to introduce CarPlay compatibility in some of their 2014 portfolio, with brands like Land Rover, Ford, Jaguar, BMW and more set to join the fray soon after.CarPlay relays key elements of your iOS device in a driving-friendly format. Through your in-car infotainment system, you can browse your music library, make or take calls, handle messages, use Apple Maps and even access some third-party services like Spotify.The big bonus here is that you can interact with the system using your car’s inbuilt hardware controls (buttons, knobs, dials etc.) or navigate with the help of Siri using your voice for a safer “eyes-free” experience. We’re closer to recreating KITT than ever before I tell you. Speaking of Siri…Just ahead of Microsoft’s plans to bring its new voice assistant Cortana to Windows Phone, Apple’s Siri has gained some new skills. What looks to be the most useful is the new home button control, which lets you continue to press the button whilst talking to Siri and release it to immediately have Siri carry out your request.Before users would have to leave an awkward pause following their command while Siri determined that they’d finished speaking, now you can simply release the home button and he/she’ll immediately hunt for the information you’re after.Also native speakers of Mandarin, UK English, Australian English and Japanese should notice that Siri speaks with a more natural sounding voice.The iOS 7 Calendar app is clean and clear to read, but it’s not as well suited as some alternatives to showing you your upcoming events. iOS 7.1 goes someway to removing that shortcoming, with an expanded list view button now residing next to the search button within the app.What’s more, if you don’t like the split month/list view, you can, with a little digging around view all of your upcoming engagements in a fullscreen list view, which is arguably much clearer to browse through.There have been a few nips and tucks throughout iOS 7.1 which should make it easier to navigate and interact with. CultOfMac goes into great depth, showcasing new visual elements found within the OS in all sorts of areas, most notably with animations and transitions.The zoom effect when opening or closing a folder has been fractionally sped up, making an already slick experience look and feel slicker. Swiping up Control Center now finishes in a playful little bounce, feeling like somewhat of an animated tip of the hat to the skeumorphic realism of iOS 6 and its predecessors.The start/end call and power off slider now follow a circle motif, as opposed to the rounded rectangular forms of before. iPhone 5S users may notice that HDR Auto mode is now an option, which will let your phone choose which of the three images it’s snapped is the best of the bunch for you.Some visual changes seem purely aesthetic, but there are many that slot more into the realm of accessibility improvements, clearing away an ambiguity in interface elements like buttons and other controls.​If you’re happy to restart the device, text can now be made bold for better visibility. The frost effect on the back of folders and other similar backgrounds can also be made less transparent and you can darken and dim both the colours and the whiteness of elements in iOS 7.1’s interface.If you still miss the button silhouettes that used to sit in the corners of iOS, then you’ll be happy to learn that ‘Button Shapes’ is a new option highlighting control elements you can interact with once again.So that’s it. Provided you have a compatible iOS device, you should be able to jump into the Settings menu, tap General and press Software Update. Assuming you’re connected to a WiFi network, the 260-280MB download shouldn’t take all that long, bringing you in line with the latest and greatest mobile experience Apple has to offer.Here’s the full changelog:Sign up to our newsletter and be the first to hear about exclusive competitions, the best deals and the latest newsSign up to our newsletter and be the first to hear about exclusive competitions, the best deals and the latest news"	Science

In the grand scheme of things, iOS 7.1 isn’t really an earth-shattering update, especially coming on the heels of the massive redesign that was iOS 7. But that’s not to say that there isn’t anything interesting in the latest upgrade to Apple’s mobile operating system. Here are just a few of the changes that have our staff applauding and, in some cases, griping.



Apple

If there’s one thing about iOS 7 that I detested over the last few months, it was the random crashes on my iPhone 5s. I crashed on websites. I crashed on the multitasking screen. I crashed while scrolling through tweets, turning on Bluetooth, and playing music. I got to know that sad white Apple logo on a matte black background far better than I ever wanted to.

But in the few hours since running the update, my iPhone 5s is speedier and happier, with nary a crash in sight. (I’m crossing my fingers that I haven’t just cursed myself by saying that.) Apple specifically called out this fix in its iOS 7.1 release notes—no doubt with knowledge of how much these random crashes have annoyed its userbase—and from what I can tell so far, it put in the legwork to back up that claim.—Serenity Caldwell

What with all the other changes in iOS 7.1, a minor tweak to FaceTime notifications might seem like small potatoes, but hear me out. As of this update, answering a FaceTime call on one of your devices will clear those notifications from your other iOS devices. What heartens me about this change is Apple’s cognizance of the fact that many of us are using multiple devices, and we often see the same notification pop up two, three, four times or more. Notifications have proved tricky, and have become one of those most tweaked features in iOS’s lifetime, and this seems to me another step in the right direction. iMessage notifications already clear on other devices if they’re read elsewhere, so it’s time for the next level: figuring out a way to save us from being pinged on every single device we own simultaneously.—Dan Moren





A gif of Calendar's new list view.




A gif of Calendar's new list view.

There are just two improvements to Apple’s built-in apps in iOS 7.1, but they’re much-welcomed ones. I know my mother (and likely many others) will rejoice over the fact that the Calendar app once again has an obvious list option: When viewing a single day, you can tap the list icon at the top to view a full list of your appointments; in month view, you can toggle a list of the highlighted day’s appointments, which show up beneath the month’s calendar. Though I’m a Fantastical convert, this change at least improves the usefulness of the Calendar app for many users.

New to the iPhone 5s is an automatic HDR setting for the Camera app. Previously, iPhone 5s users had to manually turn on or off the High Dynamic Range option; now, if you select HDR auto, the camera automatically detects when an image might be improved by HDR, and shoots in that format. This is a huge boon for shooting HDR photos—usually I keep the setting turned off because I end up with lots of duplicate images. (I have “Keep Normal Photo” enabled in Settings > Photos & Camera so I see both the original and HDR version of the picture.) But automatic HDR only kicks in when you’re in a situation where it might truly help your photo. It’s an awesome improvement to the iPhone’s already excellent camera. —SC





A quick gif of the new accessibility features in iOS 7.1.




A quick gif of the new accessibility features in iOS 7.1.

For those getting motion-sick or otherwise nauseous from iOS 7, there are nice tweaks to the Reduce Motion accessibility feature that change most of the bouncy system transitions into calmer cross-dissolves; enabling it will also remove the moving backgrounds from the Weather app and the buoyant texts in the Messages app. Similarly, the Bold Font option now applies more broadly across the OS, making text even easier-to-read for those iPhone or iPad users who are averse to skinny fonts.

But despite their utility, the Accessibility section is starting to grow crowded with all of these new options—and some of them have started to feel more like concessions on iOS 7’s design than anything else. In prior OSes, if users didn’t like a design choice, too bad. In iOS 7, if you don’t like something, chances are you can change it in Settings > General > Accessibility.

Whether all of those changes are good, well, that’s a matter of opinion. I rather wish Apple would settle on something. Lately it feels like every time I’ve just gotten accustomed to whatever effect the company’s applied to the Shift key, it’s been replaced. It’s not that I don’t like the changes (the new dark keyboard overlay in the Lock screen is particularly good) but it’d be nice if Apple’s design team would pick something and stick with it. Iterate, maybe, but don’t throw out the entire design and start from scratch every time—I’m looking at you, call screen. —SC





iOS 7.1’s button shapes at their most hideous.




iOS 7.1’s button shapes at their most hideous.

I’ll say it: I’m not a fan of the new Button Shapes accessibility option that Apple’s added in iOS 7.1. I understand the point of making buttons more obvious, but to put the “brutal” in “brutal honesty,” I think the shapes are hideous. More to the point, I feel like providing the option is a step backwards by Apple, a backing off of the convictions that led to iOS 7’s design in the first place. While this isn’t the first time Apple’s provided an option for a controversial interface decision (remember the arrival of the translucent menu bar in OS X?), this piece of backpedaling seems a little silly to me. I wonder how many people will, like me, turn on Button Shapes for about five minutes before quickly fleeing back to the shapeless present, with a sigh of relief. On second thought, maybe that was Apple’s idea all along… —DM

Unlike the other Dan, I’m happy to see the new Button Shapes option. Pre-iOS 7.1, many “buttons” in many apps weren’t really buttons at all. Rather, they were simply text that did something if you tapped on it—and that text was often the same color as non-button text. It was the kind of “for the sake of design” UI that drove many Mac users and developers batty—not to mention that left users wondering what was a button and what wasn’t. So while I do agree with Dan Moren that the new button shapes could look better (it feels as though someone at Apple said, “You want button shapes? I’ll give you button shapes!”), from a usability standpoint, they’re welcome. Here’s hoping that in iOS 7.2 they’ll look as nice as the rest of the OS.—Dan Frakes

It’s too early to say whether Apple’s promised fixes for Touch ID reliability in iOS 7.1 are the cure for all our fingerprint scanning woes, but as someone who’s spent an extensive amount of time troubleshooting Touch ID, I’m hoping for the best.





Hopefully we'll see this message less often in iOS 7.1.




Hopefully we'll see this message less often in iOS 7.1.

Touch ID wasn’t terrible on iOS 7 if you scanned the same finger multiple times from different angles, but without that knowledge, it was easy to get frustrated and disable the feature. I’m crossing my fingers that Apple paid particular attention to the rescan function: In iOS 7.0, Touch ID did a partial rescan of your finger every time you unlocked the phone, which more often than not seemed to muddle that data rather than clarify it. —SC

Despite the occasional “I can’t take any requests right now” message, I’ve grown to depend on Siri. I use the feature daily to send text and email messages, to set timers, to add appointments and reminders, and much more. But Siri and I have long had a communication problem: She doesn’t like pauses, and I frequently pause when I’m thinking of how best to phrase a command or message. Which results in frustrating situations where I’m still dictating a message, but Siri has jumped ahead to “Ready to send it?”

iOS 7.1 improves our relationship by adding what is essentially a push-to-talk feature to Siri. If you hold down the Home button while conversing with Siri, Siri won’t process your voice command or message until you release the Home button. You can even use this trick in the middle of a Siri interaction: You can say “Text my wife,” and after Siri responds with, “OK, what do you want to say … ?” you can then press the Home button and hold it down until you’re finished dictating. Siri will wait patiently, and only after you release the button will Siri transcribe what you’ve said. So … thank you, Siri … I’m so … happy we’re communicating better.—DF

733	"Start your updating because Apple has finally released iOS 7.1. While this point-release offers a handful of tweaks and bug fixes, the biggest news is undoubtedly CarPlay support. The phone, music, maps, and messages apps are all accessible through CarPlay, and even third-party audio apps like Downcast or Pandora can benefit from this system going forward. The update itself weighs in at a hefty 214MB, so you’ll definitely want to wait until you’re near a wall outlet before you tap “Update.”Right out of the gate, you’ll find that a number of basic UI elements have been noticeably tweaked for this release. The keyboard has been refreshed, numerous buttons have been redesigned for Apple’s core apps, and everything seems a little bit more responsive. From performance improvements on the iPhone 4 to refined fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 5S, it seems that this update is a no-brainer for anyone already running iOS 7.iOS 7.1 is the first public release that natively supports Apple’s brand-new CarPlay initiative. While compatible automobiles aren’t available to the masses just yet, this will be a major feature going forward. Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo will all have CarPlay-compatible vehicles on the market this year, and more than a dozen more automakers have signed on for future support. This initial release is simply laying the groundwork, but CarPlay will likely serve a huge role in Apple‘s future plans for world domination.That’s not all Cupertino has up its sleeves, mind you. If you load-up the iOS 7.1 release notes, you’ll see that a few interesting tidbits made their way into this latest release as well. The Calendar and Music apps have received a number of usability modifications, but Siri is the real star of 7.1. Previously, Siri insisted on guessing when you were finished speaking commands — if you stopped to think while dictating a text message, Siri would assume that you’ve finished, and stop listening completely. Now, Siri’s listening mode can be manually controlled by holding down the button, and releasing it when you’re finished. If you need time to think before you finish your thought, this update will make your life a little bit easier. Siri has also been given more natural-sounding voices when speaking in Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese.Also worth noting, Apple has significantly improved a number of accessibility features in iOS 7.1. In the Settings app, users can now turn on bold fonts to ensure that UI text is easier to read. The “Reduce Motion” feature now applies to animations for Weather, Messages, and multitasking. Even better, users can now toggle button shapes, reduce the white point, and darken application colors across the entire OS. Even if you’re not impressed by the flashier features, these accessibility enhancements are an important step forward in usability for the visually impaired.useless when <10% of cellphone will be using crapIOS by next year.Its sad that Apple thinks it can revive this product.At least give them credit for TRYING.there is “TRYING” and there is “DENIAL”And nobody even mentioned that CarPlay is an OS licensed from Blackberry called QNX. As always, apple reinvents the wheel by buying inventions not coming up with them, pathetic…And some people are too stupid to know the difference.No-one is going to fall for this again now that there is a jailbreak for iOS7.Why bother updating to 7.1? Sooner all later all those additional functions will also be added on iOS 7 Jailbreak.Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

734	After months of rumors and beta releases, earlier today Apple finally released iOS 7.1 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The update brings several user interface tweaks and activates the CarPlay feature. It also brings bug fixes and performance improvements. One of the exploits that it plugs is the one used by the evasi0n jailbreak tool, as confirmed by legendary iOS hacker @MuscleNerd. The exploit existed in iOS 7.0 and all subsequent incremental updates, but since it has been plugged in the latest release, that means untethered iOS 7.1 jailbreak is not possible, at least not immediately.It was feared that Apple would finally kill the exploit that evasi0n uses with iOS 7.1, and it has. Incremental updates released over the past few months didn’t deal with it anyway, so all eyes were on the major update, which has delivered. This means that all users who upgrade to iOS 7.1 will lose their current jailbreak, they won’t be able to downgrade to iOS 7.0.6, so those who update once will be stuck at iOS 7.1 without a jailbreak.We can not say for sure right now how long it will take for an iOS 7.1 jailbreak to be developed. Finding exploits takes time, its quite possible that the search and development process may end up taking a couple of months. Word of advice for anyone considering pulling the trigger on this update, don’t do it if you want to retain the jailbreak.Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Tablets. Read more about iOS 7.1 and Jailbreak.

735	Apple's release of iOS 7.1 brings several new features, big and small, to the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Something everyone will notice: The software keyboard's Caps Lock key has undergone yet another cosmetic change. Its function is the same, but its new looks threw me for a loop this afternoon. Here's what you can expect when upgrading to iOS 7.1.As you can see, the older version of the key went from grey to dark grey. The new version goes from grey to white. I like the unity here. Now, both caps states are white. Previously, lower case and one-tap caps were the same light grey, and double-tap caps lock was dark grey. Now, lower case is grey and both caps and caps lock are white. Only the arrow icon changes.It's a good change overall but will take some getting used to. I spent the first few minutes thinking I had caps lock engaged when I saw the grey key, and the white keys only added to the confusion. But now I see it was a good choice. The two caps states are the same color, while lower case has its own look.That's within 6 months after the official launch.The company's maps and directions keep getting better.It helps you feel temperature and pressure, but it can also take damage.It's free, if you have a cable subscription.A new study shows much higher error rates for people who aren't white or male.

737	By Daniel Chubb  - Mar 10, 2014The iOS 7.1 update went live just over an hour ago putting to rest any idea of a beta 6 launching, and this marks one of the biggest software updates since the original iOS 7 went live last year. The iPhone 4S update measures 186MB, the iPhone 5 increases the size to 214MB, and our iPad mini reveals an iOS 7.1 update size of 198MB. This news follows disappointment that the iOS 7.1 software update would release along with the Festival app, which never happened considering that app reached a new version a few days ago. This made some users feel that another beta would come first, although that was proved incorrect just over an hour ago.The normal apple.com/ios/ios7-update page has been updated with new features and now showcases the image found below. The main changes include Touch ID fingerprint recognition being improved, and the really annoying Home screen crashing has now been fixed along with better performance for iPhone 4 users.The main iOS 7.1 release notes can be seen in the screenshot below that we took from an iPad mini and this reveals new features like CarPlay. You will also find a number of improvements to Siri, so users can now manually control when they want Siri to be listening.Are you happy with the new features and fixes in the iOS 7.1 update? If not, what has been missed in your opinion?The CarPlay feature was expected considering all the videos we’ve seen on YouTube from betas and this new ability will certainly benefit those with cars supporting CarPlay for iPhone and iPad.Let us know how your iPhone and iPad battery life is after installing the iOS 7.1 update, especially if you get any battery drain problems. One tip would be to try a fresh install if you get such issues.Follow us on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus.Also See: Apple iPhone, iPad subscription rumors in 2018Attempted to download 7.1 to my iPhone 4S and while ‘restoring’ froze on both iTunes and iPhone screens. Phone is now stuck in a boot up loop. Currently sitting up gone 1am trying to restore to factory settings on another laptop before attempting a proper restore as first laptop just repeated the freezing screens (thank god I backed up before trying to update). Not impressed so far, I have to say.Just updated on my iPhone 4. And now my Facebook app crashes before it can open every time. Can anyone help?	Science
738	Ladies and gentleman, after five different beta sessions Apple has just released iOS 7.1 to the public, the first major update to its most recent mobile operating system iOS 7, which initially released in September. With this update, Apple has fixed some major and minor bugs and tweaked the overall user experience and visuals. It also includes the recently unveiled CarPlay feature, allowing drivers to access their iPhones “eyes-free” as it boosts Siri’s connection to the with the car.    The old keyboard on the left, the new redesigned keyboard on the right Photo: Courtesy Apple  ChangesApple redesigned a few minor visuals for the major update. On the keyboard, the delete and shift keys are now easier to see. Apple specific app icons like Messaging, Phone and FaceTime have been refined. And the moving wallpaper can now be turned off when users select a still image for the background. Users no longer swipe to answer a call as Apple has redesigned the incoming call screen to have separate accept and decline buttons. The power off screen has a new look as well. All-in-all, the redesigns are just for visual appeal and don’t change functionality at all.    The new call screen on iOS 7.1 Photo: Courtesy Apple   Major FixesThe biggest major fix Apple tackled was the random rebooting problem certain iPhone 5s, iPad Air and iPad Mini Retina owners faced. If Apple has done its job well, customers will no longer have to deal with random resetting devices. Another big correction is the Touch ID update, making it more responsive and less finicky for users with the iPhone 5s. Siri also got a big update. Now instead of the software deciding when to stop listening, users can hold down the home button to keep Siri listening to them asking where to bury a body.    The New Siri on iOS 7.1 Photo: Courtesy Apple  Minor FixesApple added several minor changes with iOS 7.1 too. The camera will now automatically enable HDR when the lighting requires it. iCloud Keychain is available in a few more countries. Apple also redesigned the user experience to be faster on all devices, including the iPhone 4, which had noticeable slowing when iOS 7 first launched.Overall, iOS 7.1 is an incremental update, but it addresses many of the issues current customers have been facing. The update can be downloaded over the air on all devices. Beta users have a larger download file, around 1.3-1.4 Gb, while users upgrading from iOS 7.06 are seeing a quick update of only 214 Mb. One thing to beware of, if you have jailbroken your device using the evasi0n hack, iOS 7.1 will patch your phone throwing it back in the proverbial jail.

739	"PhoneDog's innovative comparison tool can help you save on cell phones and plans. Find the best phone and plan for you today with PhoneDog!Well that didn't take long. Just hours after Apple released iOS 7.1 to the public, it's been discovered that there are references to two unannounced iPad models hidden inside the update.A new report from 9to5Mac reveals that iOS 7.1 includes support for ""iPad 4,3"" and ""iPad 4,6,"" two model numbers that don't belong to any currently-available iPads. For reference, the iPad Air features the model numbers iPad 4,1 and iPad 4,2, while the iPad mini with Retina display is also known by the model numbers iPad 4,4 and iPad 4,5.So what might these new iPad models be? Unfortunately, the references inside of iOS 7.1 don't offer any clues as to the identities of iPad 4,3 and iPad 4,6. 9to5Mac suggests that they could be minor hardware refreshes or possibly new models intended for an overseas market. That theory makes sense because these new models suggest that one of the devices is a new iPad Air model while the other is an iPad mini with Retina display unit. It's difficult to know what iPad 4,3 and iPad 4,6 are based on the knowledge that we've currently got, though, so for now we'll just have to sit and speculate about what these mysterious iOS devices might be. Via 9to5MacDon't forget to VOTE!

	 A visitor presses the new Apple's CarPlay touch-screen commands inside the Volvo Estate concept car displayed at the Swedish carmaker during the press day of the Geneva Motor Show in Geneva, on March 4, 2014.       Photo Credit: Getty Images     Apple Inc. released an update to the software that powers the iPhone and iPad tablet, fixing bugs that caused some customers’ smartphones to crash and implementing some design changes.The release today, called iOS 7.1, adds features that will let drivers use iPhones in cars that will be available this year using Apple software. It also gives people new ways to access the Siri voice-recognition tool by holding down the device’s home button, the company said.Last year, Apple rolled out iOS 7, the biggest overhaul of the mobile-operating system used by millions of iPhone and iPad owners. The system was revamped after design head Jony Ive took over from former software chief Scott Forstall in 2012.Customers have complained that the new version doesn’t work consistently and is prone to crashing.The software is critical because it powers Apple’s two biggest products. The iPhone and iPad accounted for more than 70 percent of the Cupertino, California-based Apple’s revenue in its latest fiscal year.Some other design changes in the update include darkening some colors and making it more obvious where to press buttons. The function for answering calls was also tweaked.For owners of the iPhone 5s, the newest high-end version of the smartphone, Apple said it also made some improvements to the TouchID fingerprint-detection technology so the device works more quickly and reliably.The latest LI business news in your inbox Monday through Friday.By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

741	ShareTweetShareShare0 commentsAfter weeks of testing and fixing the next significant update for iOS devices, the iOS 7.1 is finally available for download. Several websites predicted that it would hit anytime this week and as predicted, Apple made it available just two hours ago.iOS 7.1 brings some new features as well as bug fixes and includes some changes in the user interface too. The most significant feature of the update is the new CarPlay infotainment system. So, iPhones running iOS 7.1 will have this feature inbuilt which connects directly to the car’s dashboard and controls all its functions ‘Eyes Free’. This feature is significant because all the major car brands are expected to integrate it into their upcoming cars and the first few models from Volvo, Mercedes Benz and Ferrari will hit the market soon.The update adds some new functions to iTunes Radio app too. For example, users can now directly subscribe to iTunes match from the device instead of logging in from the desktop version. Also, they can now search within featured stations and can start a new station based on new songs and search history faster than before.The update also fixes some persistent bugs like the reboot/reset bug found on iPhone 5S and iPad Air. So, these devices will no longer reboot/ reset automatically like they previously did. The new OS will also run smoother and faster on old devices like iPhone 4, iPad 3rd Gen and iPad 2. So, those who were experiencing issues after updating to iOS 7 should finally have a smooth experience. Touch ID sensor is also improved and now recognizes inputs more accurately than before.Another important change is the way the user can give commands to Siri. iOS 7.1 now allows a user to hold the home button for a bit longer to extend its listening times. This will make sure that Siri doesn’t interrupt the user while he’s giving a long command.There are many changes in UI too. For example, the phone dialer and power off options have now rounded buttons. The repeat and shuffle icons on the Music app is more prominent. Also, the notification panel now allows the user to clear notifications accurately. The keyboard app is also revised to make delete and shift keys more accessible. Calendar app too got an update with new options for displaying events in month view and new automatic holiday additions in many countries.Overall, the update adds new features, tweaks existing apps like iTunes and Siri and even fixes some persistent bugs like ‘automatic reset’ to improve the overall experience of the iOS user.For comments and suggestions, leave a message in the comments section below.

There are number of new features of iOS 7.1 has Apple tweaks the design and improves usability of the radically overhauled operating system released in September of 2013. Feature changes abound throughout the OS but here are some highlights of the most noticeable changes on the iPhone version.Phone AppThe phone app has had one of the most significant overhauls in iOS. Gone are the rectangular buttons to start, end or decline an incoming call. These have been replaced with simple, circular buttons.WallPaperOne of the more controversial new features introduced in iOS 7 was the parallax or perspective zoom effects throughout the operating system. Now, when selecting a wallpaper in iOS 7.1, users can choose to turn off the perspective zoom effect.ShutdownThe red sliding power to shutdown your iPhone has now been replaced by a sliding power button. This also includes a new cancel button at the bottom of the screen.KeyboardA few new design elements have been introduced to the keyboard in iOS 7.1 that include a slight increase in weight to the letters to make them more legible across the board and an design change to the shift and delete keys. The dark version of the keyboard has been removed entirely.Unlock ScreenThe animation on the unlock screen has been improved with greater emphasis on the area of the screen to target for sliding your finger.Music AppWithin the music app, Apple has introduced greater emphasis to the “Repeat” and “Shuffle” buttons and added a “New” button to create an iTunes radio station.CarPlayApple describes CarPlay as a “smarter, safer way to use your iPhone in the car. CarPlay take the things you want to do with your iPhone while driving and puts them right on your car’s built-in display.” It’s said that functionality to support CarPlay has been built into the release of iOS 7.1 so it’s readily available as manufacturers begin to build the support into their vehicles. So far, Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Bez and Volvo are expected to release vehicles with support for CarPlay this year.Reboots and the “White Screen of Death”With the introduction of iOS 7.1, Apple seems to have finally resolved the issues that many users have reported of the operating system crashing and rebooting. After several hours of using iOS 7.1, we haven’t been surprised by a reboot as had been happening multiple times per day.[cf]skyword_tracking_tag[/cf] commentsYou must be logged in to post a comment.

748	Apple on Monday released the latest version of its mobile operating system, iOS 7.1. The new build for iPhones, iPads and iPod touch devices includes a number of bug fixes, visual changes and some new features such as CarPlay support. According to a new report from 9to5Mac, however, it also includes references to two unannounced iPad models that Apple plans to launch sometime in the future.As can be seen in the screenshot above, iOS 7.1 adds support for an iPad 4,3 and an iPad 4,6, neither of which exist at this point. 9to5Mac believes that the devices may be minor updates that Apple plans to roll out at some point soon without much fanfare. This is something Apple has done in the past with minor device updates.The report also notes that the iPad 4,1 and iPad 4,2 are Apple’s current iPad Air models and the iPad 4,4 and iPad 4,5 are Retina iPad mini tablets, so we should be looking at new additions to each class of Apple tablet in the near future.Copyright 2018 BGR Media, LLCPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use	Science
749	"Modern ReadersBreaking World, Tech, Sports, Business  NewsiOS 7.1 has just started making its way to Apple iPhone and iPad users, and it will come with a host of improvements, new features, and a few bug fixes too.  And while this may be exciting news to most people, device owners hoping to get their iPhones jailbroken would be best advised to leave their devices as they are, and not get them updated to iOS 7.1.  According to new reports, there’s a good chance there won’t be a jailbreak solution for Apple’s latest platform.That’s because amid all the improvements to Siri and Touch ID and the release of CarPlay, Apple has once again “nerfed” a recent jailbreaking exploit, namely the Evasi0n7 exploit.  That puts the Evad3rs crew back to front, starting at square one, as they try to work around Apple’s newest software upgrade.  The operative word, however, is “try”, because according to one crew member, Evad3rs won’t exactly be working overtime to outsmart Apple and find a way to get iOS 7.1 jailbroken.Evad3rs member “Pod2g”, in an interview with International Digital Times, was cagey when pressed with questions regarding the chances of an iOS 7.1 jailbreak, simply saying that he doesn’t know if that would be possible.  According to the crew member, it seems likely that Evad3rs “won’t focus on it as a team,” and they may save their future efforts for iOS 8.  Though that’s a huge blow to device owners who were looking forward to another exploit following a possible nerf, Pod2g did not rule out the possibility of an iOS 7.1 jailbreak.  “If one day, I find myself bored and can put enough time and energy into it, I have some ideas for how to make (an iOS) 7.1 jailbreak,” he said, adding that this would depend on how iOS 7.1 has been “fixed”, among other “external events.”

752	"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againInstead of having to manually alter the HDR setting before every photo, use auto-HDR and let your iPhone 5S do the work for you.On Monday, Apple finally released iOS 7.1. The update brings with it CarPlay support, bug fixes, improvements, and various new features. One such feature is specific to the camera on the iPhone 5S and HDR mode in the Camera app.When Apple first released HDR mode for iOS devices, the option only existed for it to be turned on or off. The all-or-nothing approach wasn't a horrible idea, but HDR photos aren't always necessary.With iOS 7.1 on the iPhone 5S, Apple has set HDR mode to automatic by default.The first time you launch the Camera app on an iPhone 5S after updating to iOS 7.1, you'll notice an ""HDR Auto"" along the top of the screen. Tapping on the label will bring up the option for you to manually turn it on or off. With HDR set to auto, you can take photos as you normally would without having to worry about remembering to turn HDR on or off. When the iPhone detects a photo that would benefit from HDR, you'll see a giant yellow HDR icon show up directly next to the shutter button on your iPhone's screen. The icon indicates HDR mode will be used for the photo. Of course, when the photo is saved to your Camera Roll it will have the standard HDR label as it always has. And the same setting exists in Settings > Camera to save the non-HDR and HDR version of a photo when an HDR photo is taken, should you want to have both copies. (I always have this enabled. Sometimes a unplanned motion can ruin an HDR photo, and having the original photo saved is a good fallback.)Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic.  We'll remove comments that violate our policy.Please read our Comment Policy before commenting."	Science
753	"Modern ReadersBreaking World, Tech, Sports, Business  NewsAfter months of waiting, Apple has rolled out iOS 7.1 to iPhone and iPad users, bringing several new features to both devices, including the much talked about CarPlay functionality that began its life last year as the more descriptive, yet less catchy iOS in the Car.Aside from CarPlay, iOS 7.1 includes improvements to Siri, such as the push-to-talk feature.  Device users need to hold the home button down while giving a command; once the button is released, Siri gets activated, which simply means device users don’t have to wait as iOS “debates” on whether you’ve finished your sentence or not.  This is similar to a recent software update rolled out for the Moto X that improved the device’s end-of-sentence recognition.  More male and female voice options have also been debuted for U.K. English, Australian English, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese.  This iOS 7.1 addition follows up the changes made on iOS 7 wherein Siri was made more realistic-sounding and less robotic.The iPhone 5s camera, in particular, will be adding a new feature, namely Smart HDR mode.  This would have the camera automatically activate high dynamic range, or HDR, depending on the scene in the photo.  iTunes Radio also gets some new functionalities with a new search field, and now allows listeners to buy an album where an iTunes Radio track belongs to, while the song is playing.  Of course, iOS 7.1 includes the usual bug fixes and stability updates, including those for Touch ID and the notorious soft reset problem experienced by some iDevice owners.

755	"     by Adam C. Engst  Nearly six months after the debut of iOS 7, Apple has released iOS 7.1, the first update to make significant feature changes to the mobile operating system, along with visual tweaks that should make using an iOS device easier for those without perfect vision, and bug fixes that promise to address home screen crashes. The update is about 200 MB if you install directly on a device via Settings > General > Software Update; if you download via iTunes, it’s about 1.25 GB and may take several tries to download successfully, if my experience was indicative.Most of the visual changes in iOS 7 revolve around making text bolder, identifying text-only buttons better, and increasing contrast, along with reducing additional animation.In Settings > General > Accessibility, the Bold Text option now applies to the keyboard, Calculator app, and many icon glyphs, significantly increasing readability. (Turning Bold Text on or off requires restarting your device.)A new option in the Accessibility settings, Button Shapes, draws shaded outlines around previously text-only buttons, which can make it easier to distinguish label text from controls. In Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast, two new options — Darken Colors and Reduce White Point — join Reduce Transparency in making the interface less washed-out. I particularly like Darken Colors, simply because I prefer more saturated colors to iOS 7’s pastels.Those who find the motion aspects of iOS 7 nausea-inducing (or just irritating) will be happy to learn that the Reduce Motion option in Accessibility now includes the Weather and Messages apps, and multitasking animations.I strongly encourage everyone to explore these settings to see which are the most comfortable for your eyes.You’ll also see a new, rounded look for the power-off screen and for the call button in the Phone app. Plus, the incoming call interface now offers separate circular Decline and Accept buttons below the controls for Remind Me and Message.New to iOS 7.1 is support for CarPlay, which is designed to use Siri voice commands and prompts to let you control certain apps, including Phone, Music, Maps, Messages, and third-party audio apps, without looking at your iPhone (only the iPhone 5, 5c, and 5s are supported). With CarPlay’s “eyes-free” approach, you’ll be able to answer an incoming phone call, dictate text messages, request directions, and navigate your music library. CarPlay also integrates control of these iOS 
apps with the car’s own buttons, knobs, and touch screen. But don’t get your hopes up unless you’re planning to buy a Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Honda, or Hyundai in the near future. Most other carmakers are promising future support for CarPlay later on. Also note that CarPlay isn’t available in all countries.Speaking of Siri, iOS 7.1 makes it possible to control when Siri listens manually by holding the Home button down while you speak and releasing it when you’re done — a sort of walkie-talkie interface. Apple has also added new, more natural-sounding male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese. No mention is made in the release notes of improved accuracy or responsiveness for Siri, which some people found less functional after the update to iOS 7.iTunes Radio receives several minor tweaks, including a search field above Featured Stations to make it easier to create stations based on a particular artist or song. You can also now buy albums from within Now Playing, and you can subscribe to iTunes Match directly within iOS 7.1 to eliminate the ads from iTunes Radio.Other welcome changes include:The Calendar app on the iPhone can now display events in month view (tap the inscrutable little button next to the magnifying glass), and includes country-specific holidays for many countries.On the iPhone 5s, a new setting in the Camera app automatically enables HDR.Support for iCloud Keychain has been added for more countries.FaceTime call notifications are automatically cleared when you answer a call on another device.Touch ID fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 5s has been improved.iPhone 4 users should see overall performance improvements after upgrading.The unread message badge on the Mail icon can now display numbers over 10,000.Last, but certainly not least, iOS 7.1 includes a variety of security fixes as well.If you notice other changes, let us know in the comments!   SearchUnless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2014 Adam C.

756	TRedmond | Mar 10, 2014The news that Apple has released iOS 7.1 creates an opportunity for Exchange administrators to get ahead of any potential problems in the interaction between the iOS mail app and Exchange ActiveSync (EAS). The rule is simple – test the new release before your users upgrade their iPhones and iPads and check that everything works, including the usually problematic areas of calendaring.For those who don’t remember previous issues, iOS 6 capped a series of problems over several releases with “meeting hijacking.” The severity of this problem had an upside in that it forced Apple and Microsoft to sit down and work out how Apple could improve the code in their mail app that calls EAS to synchronize with Exchange while Microsoft worked on server-side improvements to bulletproof EAS against the demands of errant clients. iOS 7 came along with the new iPhone 5s. There haven’t been so many problems of issues with this release but it did create a new challenge in providing users with a way around EAS security.Microsoft's work on EAS seems to be of value as fewer problems with issues such as bad client transactions causing excessive growth of transaction logs are seen, especially with the latest versions of Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2013. Apple delivers operating system updates to devices through iTunes in the same way as updates to apps are provided. Users don’t think too much about upgrading their devices and Apple boasts an impressive record of the percentage of devices that run the latest operating system when compared to Android. By the end of December 2013, 78% of Apple iOS devices were reported to have upgraded to iOS 7, which is pretty good by any yardstick.The fact that users (and iTunes) drive the upgrade pattern poses some challenges for Exchange administrators. Sure, you can put EAS device access rules in place to block devices running the new software, but who’s going to do that when it’s likely that senior executives will be among the first to upgrade their devices. The hassle and the heartache wouldn’t be worth the user reaction.Having made the switch to Windows Phone a long time ago because I consider it a superior operating system and care not a lot about the vast majority of apps available to iOS users, I am not in a position to make any comment about the value of iOS 7.1, especially in a corporate environment. But that’s not really the point – the new release is there, users will upgrade whether you like it or not, and the consequences of any lurking bug will soon be revealed.My recommendation is that Exchange administrators make it their practice to upgrade iPhone and iPad devices as quickly as they learn about new software updates and then test, test, and test again. It’s better if you find a bug and get ahead of the game before users do. Or maybe you like risk. Be safe. Upgrade and test. I bet the Office 365 people are doing that - after all, they support a hell of a lot of iOS users!Follow Tony @12KnocksinnaMore information about text formatsFollow us:	Science
757	"Apple released the long-awaited update to iOS 7, iOS 7.1, on Monday. The update includes several significant enhancements, the most notable being the addition of CarPlay.CarPlay will allow users to enjoy all the features previously described, such as use of the dashboard touchscreen of CarPlay-enabled cars to send and receive messages, make phone calls and interact with Siri.See also: 80% of Apple Mobile Devices Now Run iOS 7Speaking of Siri, another major change present in the update allows users to decide when Siri stops listening. Previously, Siri would try to detect when you stopped talking and then provide an answer. Now the software allows you to hold down the home button in the event you've paused your speech in the middle of a thought. This feature could be a huge time-saver — eliminating the need to continuously re-ask questions in perfectly-formed sentences.Interestingly, the update also includes what Apple calls ""more natural sounding"" voice options for Siri's Japanese, Australian English, Mandarin Chinese, and UK English voices. (Has someone at Apple been watching Her?)This update also addresses what users found to be less-than-perfect responsiveness on Touch ID on the iPhone 5S. But older models aren't ignored: the update improves the performance of the iPhone 4.And for those who have complained about the ""white screen of death,"" Apple's update claims to specifically address that issue termed as ""a bug that could occasionally cause a home screen crash.""Also included in the iOS 7.1 are changes to Calendar, FaceTime, Mail, Accessibility options, iTunes as well as various interface tweaks.We're still playing around with the update, so it's likely we'll find some interesting surprises in the coming hours.

758	"Last week  
 
Apple
 fleshed out its connected car vision by rebranding its iOS in the car efforts 'CarPlay' and debuting the first auto makers to use the technology in Ferrari, Mercedes and Volvo.Unfortunately for Apple, while the connected car is a cool idea, it's one of those initiatives that, at least initially, is more about buzz than bottom line. Sure, the company may be drive some software licensing revenue and additional iPhone demand by pairing up with some of the best car makers in the world, but for a company whose lofty market cap is based on expectations of introducing entirely new categories of hardware every few years, it's not exactly what investors were hoping for when Tim Cook talked about about new products in 2014.But have faith Apple fans, because there are good chances that Apple's car efforts could tie together with future products, whether they are a smart-home centric Apple TV or a wearable. As I've written before, I believe Apple has a long game of tying together different parts of a person's life by integrating its current products and future ones more deeply into their environment.Others Are Doing It AlreadyThe integration of the car into the smart home is already under way elsewhere, as just this past week, iControl, one of the largest smart home service providers in the world (iControl powers  
 
Comcast
, 
 
Time Warner
 and

 smart home offerings) announced a partnership with Zubie, a provider of connected car services around monitoring your car.
Another company, Life360, integrated its location sharing app with BMW last year, and in December announced integration with The Duchossois Group, who plans to tie Life360's location-awareness capabilities to things like its line of garage door openers and access control products.CarPlay could be about more than just the carWhat could these partnerships mean? Imagine your connected car notifying your smart home hub of its imminent arrival, which could turn on heating or lights and, as your roll into the driveway, open your garage door. It could also mean ensuring your front  doors are locked and lights are turned off when you leave.  Connected car integration could even mean your smart home hub can surface car diagnostics information in your smart home dashboard, or even transfer Spotify stations or music downloaded the night before at home.Apple's Got All The PiecesIt's these high-level integrations that I think Apple could excel at if it enters the smart home, which indications are it will. By tying together the iPhone, a revamped Apple TV and possible iWatch together with smart home awareness based on location and contextual awareness, Apple could create some powerful new products and services for consumers. I can imagine Apple even integrating iBeacon technology into the home as a way to sense and interact with wearables as the connected car.So keep your eyes on the road, as Apple may offer some new products that tie the connected car and the smart home in the not too distant future.Michael Wolf is a smart home analyst.

    Apple just released iOS 7.1, the latest major update to the operating system that powers the iPhone and iPad lineups.
  You should update you iDevice now, as 7.1 one brings a number of improvements to the controversial design of iOS 7, and also fixes a number of annoying bugs.To update, plug in your iPhone, make sure Wi-Fi is turned on, and then head to Settings -> General -> Software Update.You'll be able to significantly change the size of system fonts, change the look of certain buttons and switches throughout the OS, and have finer control over the transparency and zooming effects that some people have found irritating in iOS 7.There's also a number of fixes specifically for iPhone 5S users. Some people have found that updating to iOS 7.0.6 significantly increased battery drain on the 5S; 7.1 fixes that issue.
    Others have found that
    
      Touch ID's ability to recognize fingerprints on the first try degraded over time under iOS 7.0.x. Noted Apple blogger John Gruber has been using the iOS 7.1 beta for some time, and he has found that, if anything, it works
      too
      quickly now:
    

@buzz
@rentzsch
      If anything, it works too fast for me now. I often unlock when I just want to wake device to use lock screen camera button.
    
    The biggest issue in iOS 7 has been the so-called ""white screen of death,"" which causes many users' devices to
    crash on a too-frequent basis.
    It's
    been rumored since early February
    that iOS 7 will fix that issue as well - from personal experience and feedback from others using the iOS 7.1 beta for the last several weeks, it does some to be far more stable than iOS 7.0.x in regular usage.
  
    For those with access to a vehicle capable of using
    CarPlay
    - which won't be many people, considering it's only now being released in new cars - that feature will now be available as well.

761	Apple has finally released the iOS 7.1 update. Today, Apple device owners can download the update from iTunes. The 7.1 update includes the new Apple CarPlay app, new features, UI improvements, bug fixes, and addresses a reboot issue with the iPhone 5S, iPad mini, and iPad Air.For starters, the iOS UI has received a few changes: the phone's dialer and power off screens have been altered to feature new icons and buttons, as well as a UI shift focused on rounded UI icons. Received phone calls will now show two separate buttons: one for accepting and the other for declining. A few UI tweaks to the music app and keyboard have also been made.Touch ID, a feature that allows users to lock their iPhone 5S by fingerprint, has had recognition improved, speeding up the process between scanning and unlocking.In terms of new features, Apple CarPlay (why not iCar?) has been detailed as a means to interact with iOS devices while in a car. Described as a safter method of using your device while driving, CarPlay will employe the use of Siri voice commands for control over music, messages, and calls. CarPlay support will be seen in upcoming vehicles from Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, BMW, and Ferrari.Siri has also been given a few changes to how users can make use of the assistant. Prior to iOS 7.1, Siri's listening would continue until the device chose to stop by way of detecting audible pauses. In iOS 7.1, users hold the home button down while they give Siri a command or query and then let the button go when they are finished.IOS 7.1 is available now for download.Via: The VergeCopyright © 2017  GAMENGUIDE All rights reserved.

Lest you thought you might be waiting until iOS 8 for a new dose of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 7.1 is here with a bunch of changes, enhancements, and updates. The upgrade’s been in beta for a while, but it officially arrived on Monday.

Probably the most prominent addition in the new version is that of CarPlay, the “iOS in the Car” experience that Apple recently showed off at the Geneva Motor Show. When vehicles that support it become available later this year, CarPlay will provide an easy way to use your iOS device while driving, with support for built-in apps like Phone, Messages, and Maps, along with first- and third-party audio apps. It also features full support for Siri, as well as touchscreens and physical controls.

While we’re waiting for CarPlay, however, there are plenty of other iOS 7.1 tweaks to tide us over. Siri now features an alternate control mode: The virtual assistant can now listen as long as you hold down the Home button, and then immediately stop listening when you release it, rather than having to wait until it thinks you’re done. (If you’re fine with the old way, don’t worry: It hasn’t changed.) Those who speak Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese also get some brand new, more natural speaking voices for the assistant.

iOS 7’s iTunes Radio feature gets a new search field, so you can more quickly create stations based on a particular song or artist, as well as tighter integration with buying albums from the Now Playing screen (previously, you could just buy songs).

New interface tweaks for the Phone and Music apps arrive in iOS 7.1, along with additional Accessibility options.

Those who felt frustrated with the radical interface design changes in iOS 7 have some additional recourse in iOS 7. The Reduce Motion option that turned off the OS’s parallax feature now applies to the Weather, Messages, and multitasking interface as well, and enabling Bold Text will now affect the keyboard, calculator, and some icons. Apple’s also added options for displaying button shapes, darkening app colors to provide more contrast, and decreasing the white point for even more contrast.

And the company is still continuing to refine the OS’s interface. Several elements of the Phone app have been reworked here, with a rounded icon-based button replacing the traditional Call button, and a brand new answer screen with round interface elements. The power-off screen has been tweaked as well, as have the shuffle and repeat controls in the Music app. If you were hoping for a return to pre-iOS 7 aesthetics, that train has left the station.

There’s a veritable smorgasbord of other enhancements: Calendar can now show an agenda-style list of events in the monthly view (an iOS 6 feature many missed), and will now specifically display holidays for many different countries; iCloud Keychain is now supported in additional countries; notifications for FaceTime calls will go away if you answer the call elsewhere; and the Camera app now has a setting that will automatically enable HDR on the iPhone 5s.

If it’s bug fixes you crave, iOS 7.1 has them in spades too. A bug that could cause a crash on the home screen? Gone. Better recognition of your fingerprints for Touch ID? Check. Improved performance on the iPhone 4? You betcha. A patch for problems with the Mail icon’s unread badge showing numbers greater than 10,000? Fixed, but you should probably still clean out your inbox a bit. In our brief time using the update, it also seems notably zippier in terms of performance.

The iOS 7.1 update is available for download over the air in Software Update. (We expect it will shortly be available via Apple’s support downloads site as well.) Depending on the model of your iPhone, it varies in size, but you’ll likely need a couple free gigabytes in order to install it. It’s compatible with any device running iOS 7 or later.

763	"Sign up for our daily newsletterheader-socialSecondary menu Originally predicted to arrive in time for SXSW then later debunked, Apple has at last released the final version of its iOS 7.1 update for its mobile devices.The update to iOS 7, which has been in development for months and in beta since November, brings a whole host of stability improvements, security fixes and UI tweaks to Apple's iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV products. Although Apple hasn't explicitly mentioned so, it is believed the update carries a fix for the TouchID Fade bug experienced by some iPhone 5s owners. It also fixes the reboot loop issue we originally reported in January.Visual changes can be seen in the phone dialler app, which now has rounded UI elements to match other areas of iOS. The Music app now gives the shuffle and repeat buttons more prominence, and the shift and delete keyboard keys should be a little easier to use. Finally, it's now more obvious how to disable wallpaper motion, for anyone that was getting motion sickness from the constantly moving background images.iOS 7.1 also adds support for the recently announced CarPlay feature, which puts familiar iOS apps and services on your car dashboard.

766	The first big update to Apple’s mobile operating system is currently rolling out to users now. The update includes various improvements and bug fixes.Among the additions are support for CarPlay, and enhancements to Siri, iTunes Radio, Calendar, and Accessibility. There’s also a new camera setting which can automatically enable HDR on iPhone 5s.To make use of CarPlay you’ll need to buy a compatible vehicle, so few users will get much out of that inclusion for a while. With the Siri updates you can now manually control when the voice activated assistant listens to you. Hold down the home button, speak, and release it when you’ve finished -- just like using a walkie-talkie. There are also now more natural sounding voices for UK English, Australian English, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese.The iTunes Radio improvements include adding a search field above Featured Stations, and you can buy albums direct from Now Playing. You can also subscribe to iTunes Match directly from your device to listen to the service ad-free.Calendar tweaks include the ability to display events in month view, and country-specific holidays have been added for numerous locations.Other changes include iCloud Keychain support for additional countries, improved TouchID fingerprint recognition, better iPhone 4 performance, and interface refinements.The update will appear automatically, ready for installing, or you can manually check for it by going to General> Software Update.© 1998-2018 BetaNews, Inc.

Apple has finally made iOS 7.1 available to download for iGadget owners, with a raft of bug fixes and tweaks.It has taken Cupertino almost six months to push this upgrade out, which is nearly two months longer than iOS 6.1 took to turn up on the scene in early 2013.As we reported last week, the launch did indeed come ahead of the first iTunes Festival in the US tomorrow – as apparently the app needed to stream that requires iOS 7.1.Those with an iPhone 4 or iPad 2, or newer, can install the upgrade. So what new features will they experience, you may well ask?One of the big ones for the future (or so Apple hopes) is CarPlay support, the in-car entertainment system which we’ve been hearing a great deal about since its launch at the Geneva Motor Show last week.Siri has also been tweaked to add manual control for denoting when you’re done querying (you hold down, and then let go of the Home button when you’ve finished speaking). And the UK accents, both male and female, have also been adjusted to sound more natural (“what, what, top-hole Siri…” – or maybe not).There are also various UI adjustments, tweaks to iTunes Radio, and tinkering with the Calendar that we knew was coming, along with improvements to the Touch ID fingerprint sensor – so that should work better.Another claimed improvement is the performance of the OS on the iPhone 4, good news for those who upgraded to iOS 7 and found it too stutter-filled on this older model to be palatable.And, naturally enough, there are a load of bug fixes, which is part of the reason why this update has taken so long to come to fruition, we’d imagine. Anyway – it’s here now, so iOS 7 users, go grab it from Settings, General, and then tap Software Update.Sign up below to get the latest from IT Pro Portal, plus exclusive special offers, direct to your inbox!ITProPortal is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

768	iOS 7.1 is now available as a free download for all users currently running iOS 7.0 or above, bringing along new features like CarPlay integration as well as a host of visual tweaks and performance enhancements (including a fix for a reboot bug that has been plaguing iOS device owners). A complete changelog follows at the end of this post, but for now let’s just get the obvious out of the way.If you have ever performed an iOS update in the past (chances are you have), the following should be easy. If you have never manually updated or have only updated after being prompted by a system notification, here is how to get iOS 7.1 right now.The update will then be downloaded and prepared for installation to your iPhone or iPad. This update is rather big at 268MB, so be prepared for the download to take several minutes.When ready, the device will restart to complete the installation process. This could take 10-15 minutes, so be prepared to be without access to your phone until the process has completed.That’s it. Welcome to iOS 7.1!The full changelog as provided by Apple:   Continue reading:How to set-up Family Sharing in iOS 8How to back-up your iPhon...Truth: iPhone 6 BendReview: Doodle God 2.0I just got the 7.1 update it took four tries to download the update on my iPhone 5.

I’m sure Apple’s system is overloaded with users updating to the new OS. I;ve yet to update on my iPad Air. How are you liking it?I’m loving it. So far so good! The calendar update is awesome on the iPhone 5. I like the look of it.	Science

It has also added its new CarPlay service.The update is available now for iPhones with the download 218MB in size, while for iPad tablets it is 206MB.The update for Siri includes better controls and a new ‘more natural-sounding male and female voices’ for UK English, Australian English, Japanese and Chinese Mandarin. Apple has also made it possible to manually control when Siri listens.“Manually control when Siri listens by holding down the Home button while you speak and releasing it when you’re done as an alternative to letting Siri automatically notice when you stop talking,” it said.FaceTime has also been given an update so that “call notifications are automatically cleared when you answer a call on another device”.Perhaps most notable is Apple’s note that performance for iPhone 4 devices has been improved, in recognition of the widespread complaints that updating to iOS 7 renders many older devices almost unusable by slowing them down so much.Other changes that may appease those who were less than impressed with iOS 7 include the ability to reduce the motion on apps such as Weather and Messages, while the Calendar app includes the ability to display events in a month view, rather than just week by week.The update for CarPlay comes a week after the service was first announced with the ability to integrate with Siri to allow drivers to read and compose text messages, make calls and navigate using Maps hands free.Most recently Apple was forced to release a rushed fix for iOS 7 – iOS 7.0.6 – after a major security flaw in the operating system was uncovered relating to secure sockets layer (SSL) technology.

So what’s new?Despite it being a .1 release, iOS 7.1 doesn’t offer many new features that will leave you feeling the urge to upgrade. The software update includes several bug fixes and UI tweaks that seemingly weren’t ready when iOS 7 was released in September of last year.iOS 7.1 is focused on technical fixes. If you’ve been experiencing random reboots with your phone, iOS 7.1 will reportedly repair your issue. There are also recognition improvements to TouchID on iPhone 5s, and the operating system’s overall performance on iPhone 4 has been stepped up.If iOS 7’s various animations have left you feeling dizzy, you’ll find added improvements to the “Reduce Motion” feature in 7.1. The switch now also disables animations in Messages, Weather, and Multi-tasking, and you can now decide whether or not you want your wallpaper to have the zoomed-in, 3D look. For more on the Reduce Motion feature, check out our previous story.Here is a full list of what’s new in iOS 7.1 from Apple:CarPlay

Continued user interface refinementsIs iOS 7.1 worth the upgrade? Yes, because it’s free and offers several fixes. Even if you’re not feeling like you need all of these improvements, you’ll at least appreciate bug fixes, the aforementioned new calendar view, and better ways of controlling iOS 7’s UI. After spending a little time playing with 7.1, we’ve noticed it feels snappier as you move around the system. The darkened keyboard is also a welcomed improvement for every day use.Apple has released a handful of minor updates to the operating system over the past few months. iOS 8 is not expected to be unveiled until later this year.

771	by Blair Hanley Frank on March 10, 2014 at 10:40 amMarch 10, 2014 at 11:03 amAfter months of speculation and rumor, Apple has finally launched iOS 7.1, the first major update to its mobile operating system since the company launched iOS 7 in September of last year.For users who have been frustrated by a couple of persistent bugs, the update brings major fixes and is supposed to rectify the so-called “black screen of death” crashes that have been plaguing devices since iOS 7 launched by displaying a black or white screen with an Apple logo while a user was in middle of doing something else. iPhone 5S owners will also see improvements to Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint reading software, which has frustrated some users with its lack of reliability.The fixes come just a few weeks after Apple released iOS 7.0.6 to fix a critical SSL vulnerability in the iPhone’s code that would allow an attacker to snoop on activity that a user could think was secure.The update also adds a ton of new features, including support for CarPlay, Apple’s system for allowing users to link their iOS devices with certain new car models. Users of iTunes Radio will have an easier time creating and managing stations on the go with the new update, since Apple added a search box to allow people to easily create and search through stations for their favorite music.Siri is getting some significant improvements, with more natural sounding voices for its Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, UK English and Australian English versions. Users will also be able to tell Siri when they’re done speaking by holding down their device’s home button while talking, and then releasing it once they’ve finished talking. That change should make it easier for users to take advantage of Siri’s capabilities in crowded rooms.It’s a fairly hefty update for both my iPhone 5S and my 4th generation iPad, clocking in at over 200 megabytes for each device. That means it’s going to take a little while for the update to install — my iPad took about 15 minutes to finish installing —so users expecting an important call on their iPhone might not want to update until after they’re off the phone.Users can download and install the update for the iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches by opening the Settings app, and then going to General > Software Update. For those who don’t want to update over the air, they can connect their iOS device to their computer, and select “Check for Updates” in iTunes.As always, there’s a chance that something could go sideways when updating an iOS device, so make sure that it’s backed up before pressing the update button.Subscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headlineHave a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

The update hits devices today with practically zero excitement or revelry, which is odd considering all the goodies that have been packed inside it. This update includes the recently unveiled CarPlay features, as well as updates to Siri, iTunes Radio, Accessibility features, and performance improvements for Touch ID, the iPhone 5S camera, and an overall boost for the iPhone 4.Upgrade list:While it will be quite some time before most of us are taking advantage of CarPlay, the autoHDR mode on the iPhone 5S camera will be a welcomed addition to an already great camera app. The added Siri functionality plays right in to the CarPlay features as well, but Apple right by making it available through the rest of Siri’s capabilities. Touch ID gaining a performance boost will be a big deal for those who use it regularly, though it’s unlikely to have made the feature any more or less secure against forged fingerprints.Overall it looks like a solid update, and if you’re ready to install you can head to the Software Updates section of the Settings menu on your device. You should see iOS 7.1 already there for you to install, and the installation should only take a couple of minutes depending on your internet connection.

775	"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this againThe updated operating system also makes some changes to Siri and fixes some bugs and user interface issues.Apple on Monday released an update to its iOS 7 mobile operating system -- iOS 7.1 -- that adds new features such as CarPlay and fixes bugs.With iOS 7.1, Apple also tweaked its Siri voice assistant, iTunes Radio, and its Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The company streamlined the operating system to make it work better with the iPhone 4, made some user interface refinements, and included some stability and accessibility improvements. The update is available immediately, and the Apple devices will alert users about it over the next week.  iOS 7.1 marks the first major update following Apple's release of iOS 7 about six months ago. Apple initially unveiled iOS 7 at its developer conference in June of last year and released the operating system in September. The software underwent a complete design overhaul, with everything from the typography and color schemes getting an update. iOS 7 also added useful features like automatic updates to make everyday use easier, AirDrop, and iTunes Radio, as well as a new control center that gives quick access to most-used features. Since the introduction of iOS 7, Apple had released five beta updates of iOS 7.1 to developers.About 83 percent of Apple device users have downloaded iOS 7, Apple said. The operating system won't run on the original iPad from 2010 and any iPhones older than the iPhone 4.Apple streamlined functions in iOS 7.1 to make the experience faster for iPhone 4 users, which have a much less advanced chip than Apple's newest phones and tablets. With iOS 7, Siri recognized that a user was done talking because the person paused for a couple of seconds. Now, users can hold down the home button the entire time they're talking to Siri. Once they lift their finger, Siri knows they're done talking. Both ways of interacting are available in iOS 7.1. Apple also included new male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, British English, Australian English, and Japanese. iTunes Radio also got some tweaks. There's a new search field that allows users to create stations based on their favorite songs or artists. Users can buy albums with a single tap from iTunes Radio, rather than only buying singles. And for the first time, users can now subscribe to iTunes Match from their mobile devices rather than from the desktop.In the calendar month view, users can now toggle to see daily appointments. And the Touch ID fingerprint reader became more accurate with iOS 7.1. There should be fewer false rejections as well as quicker response times in reading fingerprints.iOS 7.1 also includes a camera update that's specific to iPhone 5S users. That's because the newer phone uses Apple's advanced A7 processor while older devices have less-powerful chips. HDR, or ""high dynamic range,"" will automatically turn on when it's needed. That takes many photos at once in different exposures to create a sharp image that looks closer to what the human eye sees, as the varying highlights and shadows are all accounted for.Meanwhile, iOS 7.1 users will be able to take advantage of Car Play, which Apple unveiled last week at the Geneva Motor Show. The feature is a means for an iPhone (5 and newer) to power a touch screen on a new car's dashboard. The interface is iOS-like, but vastly simplified compared with what's seen on a phone or tablet. Functionality is limited too -- really just letting users access maps and audio, though Siri can read messages and take dictation for responses.

SSL bug across Apple’s iDevice ecosystem, the company has made available iOS 7.1 to the public. While on the surface it contains only “improvements and bug fixes,” the company has made a number of small aesthetic changes to parts of the OS so as better to serve its hundreds of millions of customers.Specifically, Apple has re-added some of the touch indicators for buttons that were removed in the first version of iOS 7, which many people considered too flat, without enough context for where to tap.Other changes include support for CarPlay, the company’s automotive dashboard play launched last week; improvements to accessibility options, including a new bold font; options to reduce motion and parallax for Weather, Messages and multitasking; better Siri support by adding the ability to hold down the home button to activate Siri and release it when finished speaking, rather than waiting for the voice assistant to detect when you’re done.iOS 7.1 also fixes the persistent and extremely annoying random reboot issue that has been plaguing new devices, especially those with the 64-bit A7 chip like the iPhone 5s, since September. iOS 7.1 reportedly improves speed and stability on the aging iPhone 4 — Apple is still supporting a device released in 2010 — and increases the accuracy of the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 5s.The update is around 265MB for those upgrading from iOS 7.0.6, and you’ll need 2.5GB of free space to install it. It is compatible with iPhone 4, 4s, 5, 5c, 5s, iPad 2, 3, 4, Air, mini and mini with Retina, and iPod touch 5th gen.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinRedditFeatured ArticlesSign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inboxThank you for your subscriptionRelated ArticlesMar 4, 20145:52 PM ESTFeb 7, 20183:39 PM ESTFeb 7, 20186:55 PM EST	Science

779	"Back in June of last year, Apple unveiled the “iOS in the Car” — a program to interface with in-car systems — during the opening keynote of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Last week, Apple announced a name change to “CarPlay”, along with several changes, including compatibility with the iPhone 5S, 5C, and 5.Read: Apple unveils CarPlay: ""Best Driving Experience on Four Wheels""CarPlay will sport advanced features including Siri: Eyes Free mode, satellite navigation, telephone control, music functionality, and iMessage.A number of auto manufacturers announced compatibility with Apple’s CarPlay including BMW, Ferrari, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Suzuki, Toyota, Volvo, and more. Apple, for its part, doesn’t want to deploy its system until it’s deemed completely safe for operation while driving.  View the discussion thread.Advantage Business Media © Copyright 2018 Advantage Business Media"	Science

781	"While the technology is only due out on the market later this year, the Apple-based infotainment systems were already adopted by big names like Ferrari, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz – and are soon to follow on their footsteps the likes of Ford, Honda, Toyota and another dozen.“We’re moving to an era of seamless integration of digital devices and the digital automobile,” said Dieter Zetsche, which showed off the CarPlay system in Mercedes-Benz’s new C-Class line.CarPlay is a system designed to mirror the iOS functionality on the iPhone or iPad, but especially designed for safe usage in cars. It gives drivers access to what their smartphone can usually do – make calls, navigate and listen to music, but it also offers apps that expand its functionality and a special version of Siri that allows for extended voice-control.Besides putting it into new cars, rumors also say numerous automakers like Mercedes or Honda would also reveal in the near future accessory that would make CarPlay backwards compatible to cars already on the road.

782	"The Apple CarPlay infotainment system that debuted just last week at the Geneva motor show has already drawn criticism from safety experts.The new media unit – which is available to order in the Ferrari FF, and will also be offered in the all-new Volvo XC90 and in future Mercedes-Benz models – essentially allows owners to control their iPhone’s functions through the car’s dashboard. It allows hands-free calls via the Siri voice control system, text message dictation, access to Apple’s iTunes Radio streaming service – all of which are designed so you “never have to look at your iPhone while driving”.The US National Safety Council’s senior director David Teater said that rather than curb distraction, the CarPlay system could indeed add to it.“We’re very, very concerned about it,” said Teater. “The auto industry and the consumer electronics industry are really in an arms race to see how we can enable drivers to do stuff other than driving.”The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety’s manager of research and communications, Bruce Hamilton, had similar comments about the new system.“The idea that people want to be on their phones, and therefore let’s give them a way to do that – that’s not putting safety first, that’s putting convenience and the desire to be in touch first,” Hamilton said.Apple vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing, Greg Joswiak, said prior to its official unveiling at the Geneva motor show that CarPlay was about allowing drivers to enjoy their iPhone while staying safe.“CarPlay has been designed from the ground up to provide drivers with an incredible experience using their iPhone in the car,” said Joswiak. “iPhone users always want their content at their fingertips and CarPlay lets drivers use their iPhone in the car with minimised distraction.”Apple said the system will be seen in Honda and Hyundai models by the end of 2014, while BMW, Chevrolet, Citroen, Ford, Jaguar, Kia, Land Rover, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota are all committed to offering the technology in the future.

783	"Returns as of 2/12/2018Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Returns as of 2/12/2018Apple's new CarPlay system will allow you to safely do just about anything with your iPhone while driving, Apple says. Photo credit: Apple.The Geneva International Motor Show is a big event for automakers and other companies doing business in Europe. Many of those companies used the show's media days to make major product announcements -- including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Apple showed off its new CarPlay system, the production version of the ""iOS in the Car"" initiative that Apple has been talking about for a while now. It'll be available very soon in select models from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo -- and in a long list of other makers' cars starting in a few years.But what is CarPlay? As Fool contributor John Rosevear explains in this short video, CarPlay is Apple's first big foray into in-car ""infotainment"" -- an arena that is showing signs of becoming the next  big tech battleground.John Rosevear: Hey, Fools, it's John Rosevear. This past week saw the press days at the Geneva International Motor Show. This is a really important show for the auto industry in Europe and a lot of companies had important product announcements, and one of those companies was Apple.No, Apple's not going into the auto business -- not yet anyway, but they are getting into the auto ""infotainment"" system business. Apple fans have heard the company talk about a system called ""iOS in the Car"" for a while now, but now here's the actual product. It's called CarPlay. Apple has positioned this as a ""smarter, safer, and more fun way to use iPhone in the car."" It does exactly what you'd expect. It gives you a way to use your voice and some simple controls mounted on the car's steering wheel to do pretty much everything you might want to do with your iPhone while you drive.This is coming soon from a few automakers, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo showed off models that will incorporate CarPlay this past week in Geneva, and there's a long list of other automakers that will be rolling it out over the next few years.Interestingly, one of the automakers that's not on that list is Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA). We've heard all sorts of rumors about some sort of Apple-Tesla tie-up recently, but apparently this isn't going to be part of that, and my guess is that's because Tesla may have committed itself to Android, to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is working on a rival system.The difference, though, is that Google is offering more of a platform, an Android-based platform for the whole in-car infotainment system, whereas Apple's CarPlay appears to be just functionality specific to integrating the driver's iPhone. But what's interesting is that a BlackBerry news site called N4BB says that it has confirmed that CarPlay runs on top of something called QNX, which is an in-car operating system developed by a company owned by BlackBerry.QNX is used by many automakers to power their infotainment systems. Its main rival is a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) system. Now, that Microsoft system is what underpins Ford's (NYSE:F) SYNC and MyFord Touch systems, these are very prominent and as Ford owners and shareholders know, MyFord Touch has been very problematic and there were reports a few weeks ago that Ford would move the system to QNX in a couple of years, though Ford has said that they have no comment on those reports but they continue to work with Microsoft.Now, Ford is listed among the companies that will be rolling out Apple's CarPlay at some point in the future. Does that mean that Ford really is moving to QNX, or does it mean that CarPlay also works on this Microsoft in-car operating system? Whatever. It apparently means that Apple, BlackBerry, and maybe Microsoft are all working together here. Stranger things have certainly happened. Meanwhile, if you have an iPhone and you want to use it in your car, it looks like that's going to get easier over the next few years.Thanks for watching, and Fool on.John Rosevear owns shares of Apple and Ford.

With the introduction of CarPlay this week at the Geneva Motor Show, Apple's has unveiled its initial game plan for moving into automotive infotainment. The feature, formerly known as iOS in the Car and announced at the 2013 WWDC last June, is both very Apple-like and very un-Apple-like in its approach. And by not bringing anything particularly new and ground-breaking to the somewhat chaotic auto infotainment space, CarPlay is also underwhelming.First, the details: CarPlay is an iPhone-specific feature that automakers can incorporate to allow drivers to make calls, access messages, use Maps for navigation, and listen to music on a compatible connected Apple device. In a press release, Apple said drivers will do this ""with just a word or a touch,"" meaning that access to CarPlay is via a vehicle's in-dash touchscreen, or using Siri through a car's existing voice recognition button.CarPlay debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in vehicles from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo. (I shot a demo video in Volvo's Estate concept, which you can see above). Apple also said CarPlay will ""be available in select cars shipping in 2014"" from BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki, and Toyota. CarPlay will only work with the iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C and iPhone 5, or devices that use the latest Lightning connector. The feature will be available as an update to iOS 7, and pricing is not yet available.CarPlay is Apple-like in that it's an extension of the company's walled garden approach into the dashboard. This brings familiarity to iPhone owners since the UI of their device is replicated on a car's in-dash screen, and comfort to automakers seeking an intuitive interface – and less customer complaints.Andrew Poliack, director of automotive business development at QNX Software Systems, which provides the behind-the-dash processing for CarPlay, noted that since the feature works with a car's infotainment system in ""display mode,"" the response time will be faster than with similar existing iPhone-integration schemes like, say, BMW's ConnectedDrive, as well as other such systems that are device agnostic.Poliack also pointed out that CarPlay will be more easily updateable than embedded infotainment systems as new software and apps become available, since these will come through the device. At launch, CarPlay will only support ""select third-party audio apps including Spotify and iHeartRadio,"" although Apple promised that more apps are on the way.But the company hasn't indicated whether it will open up CarPlay to third-party developers the way Ford and General Motors have with their app platforms in order to spur innovation. This is very un-Apple-like since the company practically invented the app concept and provided a platform for developers, although the car is a very different and highly regulated environment.What's more un-Apple-like is that the company's traditional approach with an incipient product category like connected car (think music players and smartphones) has been to unleash class-leading innovation and cutting-edge design not previously available from others in the space. The only thing new about CarPlay is that it integrates Maps navigation with your emails, messages, and contacts to provide what Apple calls personalised routing and traffic info. Everything else – phone connectivity, messaging, navigation, and music – is already available in various forms in a variety of vehicles. And while some of these are good and some are not so good, and they could all use improvement and more interoperability among different devices, you don't have to own an iPhone to use them.No doubt CarPlay will appeal to iPhone owners and to automakers desperately seeking a smartphone integration solution that new car buyers won't curse, although the feature is useless to drivers using Android or other devices. But it also represents a further fracturing in car infotainment vis-à-vis portable device integration. With its Open Automotive Alliance, Google is also going its own way and, like Apple, making a play for the potentially lucrative connected car market. Meanwhile, the Car Connectivity Consortium with its MirrorLink standard and others like Livio Connect (which was recently acquired by Ford) are trying to establish a device agnostic approach to automotive-based smartphone integration.We shouldn't expect Apple to be concerned with integrating devices it didn't create into the dashboard, or to take a more open approach to automotive infotainment. But even within its walled garden, we've come to expect Apple to think differently when it enters a new product category. And it's very un-Apple-like to come to market with a me-too product.For more on CarPlay, see our closer look at how Apple's CarPlay works, and its potential impact on in-car Android.Sign up below to get the latest from IT Pro Portal, plus exclusive special offers, direct to your inbox!ITProPortal is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

787	"Apple's  new service that allows your iPhone to take over the in-car audio system and in-dash screen display won't include popular streaming music service Pandora  or Google  Maps.Not including these services makes business sense for Apple as the company is trying to compete with Pandora through its iTunes Radio and Google is planning a rival in-car product. But the moves are unlikely to be well-received by Apple's customers.What is Apple's CarPlay?CarPlay, which Apple introduced March 3, is an attempt to more fully integrate iPhones with the native entertainment system/in-dash screen in a variety of vehicles that its partners will soon be offering. The company described the service as follows in a launch press release.CarPlay gives iPhone users an incredibly intuitive way to make calls, use Maps, listen to music, and access messages with just a word or a touch. Users can easily control CarPlay from the car's native interface or just push-and-hold the voice control button on the steering wheel to activate Siri without distraction. Vehicles from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo will premiere CarPlay to their drivers this week, while additional auto manufacturers bringing CarPlay to their drivers down the road include BMW Group, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai Motor Company, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia Motors, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan Motor Company, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki, and Toyota Motor Corp.CarPlay will not work with just any app that can be installed on an iPhone. Instead Apple will be working with specific partners along with offering its own services. These partners include a number of music services -- Spotify and iHeartRadio -- but not Pandora. Similarly Apple Maps will be offered but Google Maps won't.How bad is not having Google Maps for Apple fans?When Apple dropped Google Maps from its new iPhone operating system in 2012, it caused such a fury that the company had to issue an apology and explain to customers how to add other map services.""While we're improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest, and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in an open letter to Apple customers.The lack of Google Maps in CarPlay may not be as big a deal now, however, as Apple has greatly improved its own Maps app.""Apple Maps has thankfully improved dramatically since its disastrous launch. In my experience it's nearly on par with Google Maps. It just lacks the web integration and extra data available on Google Maps like the destination's StreetView along with some pertinent review data,"" wrote TechCrunch's Matt Burns.Will Pandora lovers revolt?Pandora reports listener hours rather than user numbers, and in 2013 ""total listener hours grew 23% to 16.7 billion for the calendar year of 2013, compared to 13.51 billion for the calendar year of 2012,"" the company said. Pandora does not report how many users it has on iPhones, but the company's app ranked 19 in the iPhones app store as of March 5, and was the top of the music chart.Apple is likely excluding Pandora as a way to push its own similar iTunes Radio service. That may anger some Pandora fans, but it's not as critical a problem as having faulty maps. Not being able to use Pandora through CarPlay won't get you lost or point your car toward a river.Pandora had a measured response to being left out as the company clearly needs to stay on Apple's good side.""At this time, Pandora is not integrated with Apple CarPlay. As a first mover in the auto space, we continue to broaden our relationships with OEMs while also exploring other opportunities to expand our presence in the car. Apple has been and continues to be a valued partner,"" the company said in a statement sent to MacRumors.com.Apple tends to get what it wantsOther than its 2012 misstep and apology over Google Maps, Apple has generally been able to get what it wants and push other companies around. The company has dictated terms with the music industry with the iTunes store, has steadfastly kept Adobe  Flash off its products, and has maintained very strict standards in its app store. In this case, as long as Apple's Map app works, it seems unlikely Google devotees will grouse too much.Pandora fans might be a different story as there is a time investment put into building a Pandora ""radio station."" Still it seems unlikely that not being able to use Pandora in the most convenient way possible will cause any sort of mass revolt or force Apple to change its mind. Some Pandora fans will likely use one of the CarPlay offerings and some will choose to use Pandora but not through CarPlay.Leaving Google Maps and Pandora out of CarPlay is a business decision where Apple's customer are inconvenienced, but probably not enough to make them protest or decide to switch away from the iPhone.Apple has been getting its way for a long time now, but that wasn't always the case -- like back in January 2008, when David Gardner first recommended the stock. Those who followed his advice are sitting on 240% gains, and David's found similarly successful disruptive companies time and time again with stock returns like 926%, 2,239%, and 4,371%. In fact, just recently one of his favorite stocks became a 100-bagger. And he's ready to do it again.

789	"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have declined 5.4% this year so far. Its 2014 story is likely to revolve around the iPhones and newer products. But most of its upcoming products are designed to make the iPhone and iPad more useful. So, there is a distinct possibility that the tech giant may fail to impress investors, who are eagerly waiting for a revolutionary new product, says Ansuya Harjani of CNBC.Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes recently said in a research note that Wall Street is excited about some products in the pipeline such as geo-location, wearable devices, an improved Apple TV and mobile payments. But nothing, including the TV with motion sensors, seems to be as revolutionary as the iPhone or iPad. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched CarPlay earlier this week, which will allow drivers to integrate the car entertainment system with their iPhone. Though it’s a good move, it’s not sufficient to re-accelerate the iPhone sales growth to sustainable levels.Sizemore Capital Management chief Charles Sizemore says that the newer products like CarPlay are interesting. But, in reality, they are just new apps for the existing iPhone. The same holds true for the highly-anticipated iWatch. These initiatives could help Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), but are unlikely to make a huge impact on sales. The next iteration of the iPhone is unlikely to be released before September this year. That’s why Barclays believes that June quarter could be a really tough one for the tech giant.Meanwhile, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) rivals continue to release new products, which may prompt consumers to shift away from Apple in the near term. The iPhone 6 is anticipated to have a faster processor, a bigger screen and a more durable glass. But the incremental improvements are unlikely to energize customers like the original iPhone did. Moreover, as the Cupertino-based company adds advanced new features to its devices at a similar price point, its margins are likely to suffer. Apple’s smartphone and tablet market share has been contracting since late 2012. According to IDC, the company had only 15.3% smartphone market share in 2013, compared to 31.3% for Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (LON:BC94) (KRX:005930).Charles Sizemore says that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is widely owned. There aren’t enough new buyers to push up the stock sharply. The stock is trading at a massive discount to the S&P 500, and expectations are low. But Sizemore says that the tech giant seems to have lost its ‘wow’ factor. As far as long-term prospects are concerned, Barclays analyst says that the next era of technology will belong to those companies with a dominant position in web services. And devices are likely to lose their importance in coming years. Apple has been the leader in hardware development. But Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has build solid Internet services such as messaging, email, online maps and cloud. Apple needs to get better at web services because these services are important to keep the ecosystem ahead of others.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares slid 0.09% to $530.25 in pre-market trading Friday.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!

790	"  With Apple's story over the next year likely to center on iPhones and new products designed to make the smartphone more useful, the Cupertino-based company may struggle to impress investors.    ""As iPhone users, we are very excited about some products in the pipeline, like innovation in payments, geo-location, wearable devices and converged media with the Apple TV improvements,"" Barclays analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote in a report on Thursday.  ""However, nothing we anticipate seems as revolutionary as the iPhone or iPad – not even a potential TV with motion sensors possibly coming next year.""    Earlier this week, the tech giant unveiled CarPlay, a new platform that will enable drivers to integrate their iPhone and car entertainment system.    (Read more: Has the iCar arrived? Apple launches in-car platform)   While this is a positive development, analysts don't expect such products to re-accelerate growth in the iPhone category to sustainable double-digit levels. Apple reported sales of 51 million iPhones during the last quarter of 2013, up 7 percent from the same period in 2012.    ""Some of Apple's newer launches, such as CarPlay, are interesting, but they are essentially just new applications for the existing iPhone. The same is true of 'wearables' such as the long-awaited Apple watch. These are initiatives that Apple should follow, of course, but none are going to make a huge impact on sales,"" said Charles Sizemore, chief investment advisor of investment advisor Sizemore Capital Management.   Tough quarter ahead?   Barclays says with no major product launches until the second-half, the June quarter could be a tough one for Apple.    ""We believe the smartphone market could start to shift away from Apple in the very near term given new product launches from competitors and a lack of new products until the second half of 2014,"" the bank said.    Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 6 in the second half of this year, with features such as a larger screen, more durable glass and a faster processor.    However, the incremental improvements to its products are unlikely to be enough to reenergize its customer base the same way the original iPhone did in 2007, the bank said. Additionally, the company's margins may come under pressure as it adds advanced new features to new iPhones at similar price point.    ""It seems very hard for hardware vendors to sustain competitive advantages for any meaningful length of time,"" the bank said.    (Read more: Will you be driving an iCar soon?)   Since refreshing its iPhone and tablet lines in the second half of 2012, Apple has experienced a contraction in its market share for both - a continued worry for investors.    Apple's smartphone market share, for example, stood at 18 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from 21 percent a year earlier.    Barclays downgraded its recommendation on Apple to neutral from overweight towards the end of February, with a 12-month price target of $570. Apple shares, which are currently trading at $530, are down 5.4 percent year-to-date - underperforming the Nasdaq Composite's 4.2 percent rise.    Sizemore says given how widely owned Apple's stock is there aren't enough new buyers to drive the price sharply higher. However, he thinks the stock offers decent value and expects it to outperform the market over the coming year, forecasting gains of 10-15 percent in 2014.    ""Expectations are low, and the stock is cheap.  The stock trades at a massive discount to the S&P 500, which is ridiculous.  At the least it should trade at the market's price-to-earnings ratio, and I would agree with Carl Icahn that it should trade at a premium,"" he said.   That said, Sizemore acknowledges Apple seems to have lost its ""wow"" factor and is no longer an explosive growth company.   Apple's relevance in question   The next era of consumer technology favors those with leadership in web services, the bank said, with devices likely to become less important over the next few years.    ""If we were to see evidence that payments and/or new content deals were to markedly enhance the web services aspect of the Apple story vs. Google long-term, we may need to reassess this position,"" he said.    (Read more: Apple investors, you're trading this stock all wrong: Pro)   While Apple's core strength has been developing universally acclaimed hardware, Google has excelled at delivering internet services such as online maps, email and messaging. But Google appears to be getting better at design, faster than Apple is getting better at web services, according to industry experts.    ""We see the best prospects for future revenue in social, web, and the cloud.

792	"When Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed its CarPlay feature, the company said it would include support for just four third-party apps—Spotify, Stitcher, Beats Music and iHeartRadio—at some point this year. Of course Apple will also support all of its apps, including iTunes Radio and Apple Maps. But will the company allow Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), the king of maps, to make an app for the CarPlay platform? That’s certainly a good question.Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Maps were once on iOS products, but then Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) pulled them and replaced them with its own maps. That was a disaster because of all the problems with the app, and many iPhone users switched back to Google by downloading Google’s separate app onto their iPhones.Mashable‘s Karissa Bell believes that more third-party developer apps will make their way onto the CarPlay platform, but of course there’s no way to know if Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s maps will make it on there. There is certainly a chance that it could happen, but users will probably have to accept less functionality than with Apple Maps because of course Siri is integrated with Apple Maps in the iPhone. We wouldn’t expect anything less in CarPlayBut Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) really doesn’t have anything to worry about from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of putting its operating system in cars. The search giant is already ahead of Apple in this respect. More than six of the world’s top automakers, including Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) (TYO:7203), Mercedes and others, already have Google Maps APIs or some other form of the search giant’s GPS services inside their vehicles.Currently Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only one which uses Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Maps for turn-by-turn directions. However, Hyundai and Kia both have the Google Places API integrated into their cars. That API uses the same database as Google Maps. Hyundai, Kia, BMW and Toyota all utilize Google’s Send to Car feature, enabling drivers to search Google Maps for directions and send them to the navigation system inside their cars.We may learn more about what Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has planned for cars at its I/O conference in June. The search giant already announced that it was partnering with General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Hyundai and Audi to put its Android operating system in cars. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has just announced a partnership with GM and other automakers, it is essentially playing catchup to Google.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!

794	In the latest Apple TV update, Cupertino has made it a whole lot easier to stash away unwanted channels, making everything else look a whole lot more clean cut than before. This particular update was released alongside the reveal of iOS 7.1, where the Apple TV’s latest update has seen its version number bumped up all the way to version 6.1. It is certainly a welcome change from the past where one would have been required to navigate to Settings, before making a pass through the entire list of available content sources in order to hide them.With the latest update, all that a user needs to do would be to highlight an icon on the screen, followed by pressing and holding down the select button until the icons begin to jiggle. When that happens, pick the channel that you would like to be out of sight, before hitting the Play/Pause button in order to bring up the options, followed by pressing Hide. Sounds like you have made a mistake after doing all of that? Fret not, there is an easy method to undo this, where all that one needs to do is to go to Settings > Main Menu, followed by selecting the desired channel.Filed in Apple..	Science

796	       by Josh Centers  Apple has released Apple TV 6.1, available for the second- and third-generation Apple TV models. The key improvement for end users is an easier method of hiding unwanted apps. To download the update manually, choose Settings > General > Software Updates > Update Software.Previously, to hide an app, you had to fiddle with parental controls (as I described in my book, “Take Control of Apple TV”). Now, the interface for hiding apps has moved to Settings > Main Menu. If you have enabled restrictions in Settings > General > Restrictions, you must enter your passcode to hide or show apps.You can also now easily hide apps from the main menu. To do so, hold down the Select button on your remote until the apps shake (this won’t work on the top “dock” row), press Play/Pause, and select Hide This Item. To unhide an app, choose Settings > Main Menu and set the app to Show.The update features a number of security fixes as well.Apple has also updated the Remote app for iOS to version 4.2, which adds content controls for iTunes Radio and purchased content from the iTunes Store. By default, Remote 4.2 dedicates the first tab to iTunes Radio. Select a station and it plays on your Apple TV. If you tap More, you can play purchased TV shows, movies, rentals, and music videos directly on your Apple TV, without involving AirPlay. To take advantage of the new features, you must first update your Apple TV to version 6.1.  SearchUnless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2014 Josh CentersTidBITS is copyright © 2018 TidBITS Publishing Inc.Reuse governed by Creative Commons License.About TidBITS | Advertise with TidBITS! | Contact Info | Copyright Terms | Privacy Policy	Science
797	"This week Apple has released the newest bit of software update to their Apple TV hardware, complete with newly enhanced cleaning abilities. While iOS 7.1 – also released this week – still has you need to keep several icons in your folders or on home screens, here Apple TV makes clear they’re OK with you pushing some of your lesser-needed icons down or aside.
Unfortunately it would appear that, similar to iOS, you still won’t be able to get rid of icons for apps you don’t use completely. This update to Apple TV brings the system up to version 6.1, allowing you to re-arrange your icons as you see fit. So you can place Netflix right up top and Flickr right at the bottom, or TV Shows right at the bottom and Music up top. Whatever floats your boat.This new option goes by the name of “Arrange Main Menu Items”, and it’s accessible by pressing and holding an icon until the icon “jiggles.” This is similar to how you re-arrange icons in iOS, if you did not know. From there you’ll be able to press your controller’s directional buttons to move the icon. You’ll also be able to press Play or Pause for additional options.Far from a change that would signal any new hardware release, this software update simply suggests Apple isn’t always about ground-breaking change. It’s just a little clutter re-arranger, that’s all. Have a peek at our Apple TV tag portal for more, or head down to the timeline below for other recent Apple TV bits and pieces.

798	Monday, February 12, 2018 | Updated at  12:33 PM ETA number of key applications emerged on iOS and Android platforms this week to help users keep up with a busy week of action ahead of us.From SXSW in Texas to the Paralympics in Sochi, this week marks a busy time in the world. Below, we have listed some of the top new apps for the week and it doesn't matter whether your phone runs on iOS and Android -- we have apps for both. Check out the new list below and let us know which apps are your favorite1. iTunes Festival: This app goes along with the SXSW GO app in that the iTunes festival takes place at SXSW. From March 11-15 you'll be able to enjoy several nights of music with stars such as Coldplay and Keith Urban.2. Sochi 2014 Results/Paralympic Games: There were apps for the mainsteam Sochi Olympics but thankfully there are also applications for the Paralympic games. Check here for all the latest results and information related to the events.3. SXSW GO: Official 2014 Mobile Guide: We've heard plenty of things about the upcoming SXSW event and it makes plenty of sense to see an app for it. Allow this app to guide you throughout the event in Texas.4. Alarm Pad on Android: Think of this app as a sort of interactive alarm clock. Instead of the usual alarm clock that would just simply wake you up, this one puts your entire day in front of you when you wake up. From events to other parts of your schedule, this app can help prepare you for the day ahead much more so than a regular alarm clock app.5. Adobe Revel on Android: There seems to be hundreds of different apps to help us manage our photos, but this one is unique because it markets itself as one that keeps your photos totally private and secure.Tagstech, iphone, iphone 5s, iphone 5c, android, iOS 7, iOS immmigrants sanctuary city Business is booming for Latino entrepreneurs, especially in Southern California, where the growth in the number of Hispanic-owned businesses (HOBs) has bloomed despite the recession and tough economic recovery.

800	Apple not only updated iOS devices today, it also had a couple new things set to go for its second and third generation Apple TV devices.Apple TV update 6.1 brought with it several new features, but possibly the biggest is the new ability to hide unwanted channels. As Apple has finally allowed more content partners to enter the ecosystem, the channel selection menu has begun to look a little crowded. Now you can choose to hide any unwanted channels. Simply navigate to the desired channel, hold down the select button on your remote and you will begin to see it shake in a similar fashion to when you move an app on an iOS device. Once you do that, use the play/pause button to choose what to do with it.There is also a handy new feature that will allow you to view your purchased content on the Remote app on your iOS device, and then select it to begin playing automatically on your Apple TV.Here is the complete change log of what was updated.With Apple TV having generated $1 billion in revenue for Apple last year, and all of the work being done to add new channels to the set top box, it would appear that Apple is taking it as a far more serious product than it used to. Now if we could just out if there really is a new version coming in the near future.Sean P. Aune has been a professional technology blogger since July 2007, but his love of tech dates back to at least 1976 when his parents bought...Sean P.

801	Sign-up to our NewsletterApple has released an Apple TV 6.1 update for the Apple TV set-top box on Monday, hot off the heals of iOS 7.1 for the iPhone and iPad. The Apple TV update is welcomed, bringing a greater level of control to the media streamer. Users can now reduce the number of channels found on their home screen, without having to go into settings - as has been available for the iPhone and iPad since launch. Using the remote that ships with the Apple TV, users can hold the select button to make the icons move up and down. Icons can then be dragged around in the order users choose. Holding the play/pause button will then enable users to pick which icons to hide. As more and more apps have been released for the Apple TV, this level of control is necessary. Not everyone wants to watch WWE Network, TV4, or Red Bull TV - while others want to do away with Netflix or Bloomberg. The ability may be a step in the right direction for Apple's living room efforts, specifically for the long-requested App Store feature users have been begging for. Furthermore, the Remote app for iOS that allows users to control the Apple TV from their iPhone or iPad has also been updated. Users can now control iTunes Radio from their Apple TV and browse purchased movies and TV shows in the app and beam them to the Apple TV.The two Apple TV updates follow iOS 7.1's release on Monday, which brings CarPlay support, new UI elements, and stability fixes to the iPhone and iPad.	Science
802	Alongside the release of iOS 7.1, Apple TV also received a software update today. Most notable among the changes? An easier method for hiding those channels that you don't watch. Before now, you had to take a trip to the Settings menu and hide each option from a list. After installing Apple TV version 6.1, pick a channel from the main menu and hold the Select button to make the icons dance. Once they start to jiggle, use the directional buttons to move around before hitting the Play/Pause button to hide that content source. This certainly isn't a major leap, but it's sure you save some time and extra navigating for tidying up that primary menu.That's within 6 months after the official launch.The company's maps and directions keep getting better.It helps you feel temperature and pressure, but it can also take damage.It's free, if you have a cable subscription.A new study shows much higher error rates for people who aren't white or male.

805	While the release of iOS 7.1 has taken the majority of the attention this afternoon, an update for Apple TV has also arrived. We’re not talking the simple addition of a channel or two to the set-top box’s lineup, either (though the iTunes Festival app did arrive over the weekend). The update takes Apple TV to version 6.1 and brings the ability to more easily arrange what channels are displayed on the main menu.Users can arrange main menu items in two ways. The first is through the Settings menu under Main Menu. The second, similar to iOS, allows users to rearrange or hide items by long-pressing with the center button of the remote.With an expanding selection of streaming content arriving over the past months, the added ability to arrange and hide unwanted content is a welcome addition that will allow users to highlight and quickly find programming they enjoy.

I'll take Fox (for Family Guy and American Dad), Food Network (for fiancée), and I think there's another channel my fiancée would want (E! ? Not sure what the other channel she watches is). Oh, and CC for South Park, of course.

That would be $40/month. Much better than what I'm paying right now for hundreds of channels I don't want just so I can have the four I want.Right.... Leave all the idiots who have bought your products behind, hopefully they'll be dim enough to buy your ""new and improved"" product, if you don't give them a meaningful upgrade.

We still cannot hide the Apple tiles on the top. These are basically ads for Apple services and we should be able to get rid of them and replace them with tiles we actually use, like Netflix or anything else.

Apple TV is not a free product, the box actually costs costs more than most competitors' products. We should not be force-fed Apple tiles (ads) on hardware we paid for.I completely agree! Finally, we can put NewStand in a folder, but I'd like to hide some of those apps entirely! If they can't be uninstalled, please just let us hide the icon from view.

812	For those that can’t make the trip to Austin, TX to experience Apple’s SXSW iTunes Festival firsthand, the event’s official apps have arrived. The iTunes Festival channel reached Apple TV users over the weekend after the concert series’ app for iOS debuted late last week.Both on Apple TV and on iOS devices (including iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) users will be able to livestream performances from artists including Coldplay, Kendrick Lamar, Willie Nelson, and Pitbull. The apps provide background information about participating acts as well as links to selected music via iTunes.Rumors last week from the fairly reliable John Gruber of Daring Fireball suggested that the launch of the iTunes Festival app hinged on the release of iOS 7.1, suggesting the new version of Apple’s mobile platform would launch prior to availability. This turns out to not be the case, though iOS 7.1 is still believed to be on track for a March release.The iTunes Festival kicks off this week with a performance by Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, and London Grammar on March 11th. The debut show begins at 7:30PM local time. The remaining concerts, which take place over four consecutive nights, begin at 8PM. iOS users can download the new app from iTunes/the App Store now, while those with Apple TV should already see the new channel displayed front-and-center.[via iTunes] Continue reading:How to set-up Family Sharing in iOS 8How to back-up your iPhon...Truth: iPhone 6 BendReview: Doodle God 2.0	Science

The channel will whet viewers’ appetites with information on the performers as well as the festival itself in preparation for the big event to be held during SxSW this week.
Held in London for the past years, Apple has finally decided to bring over its famed iTunes Festival to US shores. Apple has so far streamed 400 concerts from these festivals, involving big names in the music industry and garnering tens of millions of live stream viewers.Last month, Apple made it known that it will finally be holding the iTunes Festival in the US. This will take place for five days during SxSW in Austin, Texas starting on Tuesday and will be streamed to iTune on the PC, Mac, as well as Apple’s own devices. The iOS app debuted last week and now Apple is making the same experience available on Apple TV.Viewers will be treated to biographical information about the performers as well as links to their iTunes Store pages. But more than that, the channel also gives access to the history of the festival, information on previous concerts and how to acquire them.Confirmed artists include Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, and London Grammar on March 11, Pitbull and ZEDD, both on March 14, and Keith Urban and Willie Nelson on the 15th. The performances will be streamed live in high-definition streams. This first US iTunes Festival will most likely be available for purchase later, just like other festival concerts in the past.VIA: Apple Insider

Gas prices up another four cents this week
Gasoline prices in Massachusetts are up four cents from last week, according to AAA Southern New England.
AAA’s March 10 survey of prices in Massachusetts found self-serve, regular unleaded averaging $3.52 per gallon, up four cents from last week. Prices locally are 16 cents higher than a month ago. The current price is three cents higher than the national average for self serve unleaded of $3.49. A year ago at this time the Massachusetts average price was 17 cents higher at $3.69.
The range in prices in the latest AAA survey for unleaded regular is 28 cents, from a low of $3.41 to a high of $3.69. AAA advises motorists to shop around for the best prices in their area, and to make sure they and their passengers buckle up — every trip-every time.
This week's local gas prices and their ranges are as follows:
Self Serve                      Grade
$3.529 ($3.419-$3.699) Regular Unleaded
$3.719 ($3.559-$3.899) Midgrade Unleaded
$3.849 ($3.659-$4.199) Premium Unleaded
$4.269 ($4.169-$4.499) Diesel

AAA Fuel Saving Tip of the Week:
Aggressive driving can lower a car’s fuel economy by up to 33 percent. Instead of making quick starts and sudden stops, go easy on both pedals. If there is a red light ahead, ease off the gas and coast up to it rather than waiting until the last second to brake.© Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

In what's becoming a traditional sign that spring is arriving in Whatcom County, gasoline prices are rising at local stations.  On Monday, March 10, the average price for a gallon of gas in the Bellingham metro area was $3.64, according to data from AAA Washington's Daily Fuel Gauge report. That's up 11 cents from last week and up 24 cents compared to a month ago.  While up significantly from the past month, it's still much lower than a year ago, when the average price was $3.98 a gallon.  Gas prices tend to rise in the spring as demand for fuel picks up and some refineries go offline for maintenance work and to switch to the spring/summer blends.Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more.  Bellingham's average price is once again the highest among major Washington metro areas, followed by Seattle at $3.58 a gallon. The Spokane area has the least expensive gas, averaging $3.37 a gallon.  The average price for a gallon of diesel is $4.04 a gallon, up 4 cents in a week. Last year, the average price for a gallon of diesel in Bellingham was $4.27.

That year-over-year gap has narrowed by 15 cents over the last two weeks.  Last year the national average peaked at $3.79 on February 27, the earliest peak on record.Rapidly escalating tensions in Ukraine have been the major story for the oil markets this week.  At 10.4 million barrels per day, russia is the third largest oil-producing country after Saudi Arabia (11.7 million barrels per day) and the United States (11.1 million barrels per day), according to the most recent Energy Information Administration data.  Although there have been no disruptions to global supplies yet, any further escalation of hostilities could propel global oil prices higher, which has the potential to magnify the seasonal price increases at the pump.  Earlier in this week, crude oil prices spiked over the rising tensions between russia and Ukraine, settling close to the $105 per barrel mark, the highest settlement price in five months. However, as the week progressed and russia softened its rhetoric, crude oil prices eased back close to the $100 per barrel mark.  Crude oil settled at $102.58, virtually unchanged on the week.In its weekly report, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) noted that U.S. crude oil stocks rose 1.4 million barrels to 363.8 million barrels.  Gasoline stocks dropped 1.63 million barrels to 229 million barrels.  According to the EIA data, gasoline demand dropped 124,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 8.411 million bpd, however the weekly demand figure remains above the four week average of 8.325 bpd.“AAA expects gas prices to increase 10 to 20 cents more this spring before falling after Memorial Day, barring any unexpected market-moving events,” said Martha M. Meade, Manager of Public and Government Affairs for AAA Mid-Atlantic.  “However, the intensifying situation with russia and Ukraine could constitute such an event.  Further escalation, including any disruption to global supply, could propel global oil prices higher, which has the potential to magnify the seasonal price increase at the pump.”Last year the national average peaked at $3.79 on February 27, the earliest pre-summer peak on record.  Gas prices are expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks due to seasonal refinery maintenance, which means the year-over-year discount will narrow further; however the national price at the pump is unlikely to surpass last year’s high and AAA expects it to peak between $3.55 – 3.75, barring any unexpected market moving events.  The rapidly escalating geopolitical tensions with russia and Ukraine could constitute such an event should global oil supply be impacted. CURRENT AND PAST GAS PRICE AVERAGESRegular Unleaded Gasoline (*indicates record high)

835	CAMARILLO, Calif. -- The U.S. average retail price of regular grade gasoline rose 9.87 cents per gallon in the past two weeks, to $3.5098. It is up 21.54 cents in the past month, and is the highest since late September, according to the most recent Lundberg Survey of approximately 2,500 U.S. gas stations.Although crude oil trumps all as gasoline price leader, it was not crude oil in this two week period that brought the pump price up nearly a dime. Two main benchmark grades, WTI and Brent, did not freak out on Ukraine. WTI did bleat briefly during the two weeks, but ended close to the price of two weeks earlier; and Brent, a better measure of Ukraine's impact on oil, actually retreated.Ethanol seems to have cared more about Ukraine than crude did, since Feb. 21, with its prices rising in part because Ukraine is a corn exporter.Two other factors helped bring motorists this extra dime--refiner pass-through of earlier crude oil price rises, translating to a modest gasoline margin gain for refining--and also a modest gasoline margin recovery for retailers.Retail margin expanded by nearly four cents per gallon but is still below 13 cents. During the first 10 weeks of 2013, retail margin was far superior to what it has been this year.Daylight Saving Time has begun, incentivizing motorist demand with another hour of daylight for after-work errands. And, the current price is 23 cents below its year-ago point, another positive for demand.Very near term, unless crude oils do jump high, we are unlikely to see more than a small further price hike at the pump. Spring gasoline prices cannot be known, but even if crude oil markets are calm, gasoline prices will be higher than they otherwise would be, thanks to seasonally building demand coinciding with the higher cost of gasoline from the mandated seasonal reductions of vapor pressure.Gasoline supply is good, as is the refining capacity use rate. One reasonable scenario if crude oil prices don't skyrocket or crash: First a small further uptick feeding downstream gasoline margins, followed by relatively stable pump prices, then a steeper climb to a Spring peak.Camarillo, Calif.-based Lundberg Survey Inc. is an independent market research company specializing in the U.S. petroleum marketing and related industries.Click here for previous Lundberg Survey reports in CSP Daily News.Amstel Xlight, Murphy’s Stout and Newcastle unveil new campaignsAnswers to the cheesiest of conundrums	Science

                Americans might be anxiously waiting for Spring and warmer weather, but the season change will also bring higher gas prices.Continue Reading BelowThe Lundberg Survey of fuel prices released a new report Sunday showing the price of gasoline increased 10 cents over the past two weeks to $3.51 for a gallon of regular fuel.Patrick DeHaan, senior analyst at GasBuddy.com, says prices typically increase this time of year because of refinery maintenance and the switch to summer gasoline.“Refinery maintenance results in lower production, temporarily, while refineries prepare their facilities for the summer driving season,” DeHaan says. “There’s an added cost because there’s less being produced. There is also unrest in Venezuela and Ukraine which have increased oil prices.”DeHaan predicts prices at the pump to stay high through early May, once refinery maintenance season is over.“We should see prices slide into Memorial Day and for a good portion of June,” he says.Continue Reading BelowADVERTISEMENTSo if you are looking to save some cash amidst the latest spike in pricing, here are a few tips from DeHaan and GasBuddy.com.No. 1: Use online tools to research. Knowing where prices are higher and lower can help you to save up to 25 cents per gallon. “Every station is charging a different price,” he says. “Shopping around with a quick free app means you can find the cheapest station.”No. 2: Drive defensively. Adjusting your driving habits may seem burdensome, but it can help you use up less gas per trip, he says. “If you slow down and drive more defensively, you can increase your fuel economy by about 10%,” he says.No. 3: Consider wholesale clubs. Joining a wholesale club like Sam’s (WMT) or BJ’s can bring cheaper gas prices.DeHaan says GasBuddy research shows these clubs often have lower-than-average fuel costs. “It’s generally a guaranteed 10-to-20 cents off per gallon,” he says. “There’s a membership fee, but it almost pays for itself.”Click the button below to comment on this article.Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Then, as refineries get back online, the volatility will ebb, and prices will slow their climb- but all of that light at the end of the tunnel remains several weeks away,” DeHaan said.Prices in Monroe Monday, according to ConnecticutGasPrices.com, included:

863	SHEBOYGAN COUNTY, WI (WHBL) - Gas prices continue their annual late winter rise.  In Sheboygan County, all but a few stations are reporting a price of $3.59 for a gallon of unleaded regular.  That is the state average, according to the daily Wisconsin AAA Fuel Gauge Report.  That price is up seven cents from one week ago, and 33 cents higher than one month ago.The website Wisconsin Gas Prices reports the cheapest gas at $3.45 in Prescott along the Minnesota border.  The most expensive is $3.79, reported in Pleasant Prairie, Rice Lake, and Mercer.The reason for the recent rise is due to lower supplies as refineries perform annual maintenance and gas blends switch for the changing seasons. 	Science

877	UNDATED (KDAL) - Gas prices are up about ten cents a gallon from two weeks ago and the Lundberg Survey says the increase is due to several factors including the situation in the Ukraine, the cost of ethanol and refineries cutting production for routine maintenance.  Nationally the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded is around 3.51, 21 cents higher than four weeks ago.  In Minnesota the average price is 3.52 and Duluth stations have prices ranging from 3.51 to 3.59 a gallon. The lowest price in the 48 adjacent states is 3.18 in Jackson, Mississippi and the highest is 3.94 in Los Angeles.	Science
878	"According to a Lundberg survey released on Sunday, March 9, the price of gasoline at US pumps has increased by nearly 10 cents per gallon over the last two weeks. The rise in the cost of gas in the country's pumps is an upshot of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has led to an increase in the cost of Ethanol used in making gasoline.	As per the figures released by the latest Lundberg survey of nearly 2,500 US gas pumps, the national average cost of self-serve, regular-grade gas in the US was $3.51 per gallon on March 7. The mentioned average marked a 10 cent per gallon over the gas costs two weeks back; and a 6.5 percent increase in the last one month.	The Lundberg survey has revealed that, of the cities surveyed in the Lower 48 states, the lowest US average price for one gallon of gas was $3.18, in Jackson, Miss.; whereas the highest price was $3.94, in Los Angeles.	However, despite the recent increase, US drivers are still paying 20 cents or so less for one gallon of gas as compared to the cost a year back, when the country-wide average was $3.7 per gallon.	Noting that the US average gas costs have been driven up in the past two weeks because of higher ""ethanol"" prices, stemming partly from the unrest in Ukraine, Lundberg Survey's Trilby Lundberg said that the cost will likely increase ""a few more pennies"" in the near term."	Science
879	"  U.S. drivers are paying nearly 10 cents more per gallon at the pump than they did two weeks ago, as worries about Ukraine contributed to a jump in the cost of ethanol used in making gasoline, according to a survey released on Sunday.   The Lundberg survey said the national average price of self-serve, regular-grade gasoline was $3.5098 per gallon on March 7, up 9.87 cents from two weeks earlier, and up 21.54 cents, or 6.5 percent, in just the last four weeks.   Diesel fuel prices also rose, increasing by 2.58 cents from two weeks earlier to an average $4.0323 per gallon.   (Read more: Why US can export nat gas without raising prices)   But U.S. consumers are paying about 23 cents less for a gallon of gasoline than a year ago, when it cost $3.7394.   The Lundberg survey of about 2,500 gas stations comes out every second or third week.   Trilby Lundberg, who conducts the survey, said recent increases in ethanol prices affected pump prices because ethanol is blended into gasoline.   She said the uncertainty over Ukraine's future also factors into this because ""Ukraine is a major corn exporter and nearly all ethanol in the United States is made from corn.""   Also contributing to higher gas prices were improved profit margins for retailers and refiners, she said.   (Read more: Russia: Sanctions will 'boomerang')   Prices may rise ""a few more pennies"" in the near term, she said, but unless crude oil prices surge or the Ukraine situation worsens significantly, they likely will not head much higher before April or May, when more-costly summer-blend gasoline enters the market ahead of the peak driving season.   She also said this weekend's start of daylight saving time in the United States and Canada could increase demand, and as a result, prices for gas because it gives people an extra hour after work to use their cars and trucks for errands.   Brent crude prices closed Friday at $109.00 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures settled at $102.58.   (Read more: Putin defends Crimea's move to hold referendum)  According to the Lundberg survey, the lowest average price for a gallon of unleaded gas in the 48 contiguous U.S. states is $3.18 in Jackson, Mississippi, and the highest price is $3.94 in Los Angeles.

892	Today, NSA leaker Edward Snowden spoke to SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas, via satellite from the comfort of Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Send this to a friend	Science
893	"AUSTIN, Texas — Edward Snowden brought no bombshells when he arrived to an excited round of applause Monday, his stubbled face relaxed as it was beamed in from across the continents for a ""virtual conversation"" about the vulnerability of personal data. His presence was event enough.Public appearances by the former National Security Agency contractor and U.S. exile are rare, and this one was beamed in from an undisclosed location in Russia via several online proxies for his own security, a bit of technological cloak-and-dagger that could only add to his mystique for the three roomfuls of international tech specialists struggling to hear his words in video that was choppy and often inaudible.His message still got through: Personal information is vulnerable not only to government prying but to growing numbers of outside infiltrators because companies have failed to adequately protect the data of their customers. His own exile after leaking to reporters secret information he had gathered while an NSA consultant has made him a central figure in that conversation, and he says he has no regrets.""Would I do it again? Absolutely,"" Snowden said into the camera, in response to one of several questions submitted to him via Twitter (#AskSnowden) and screened backstage at the South by Southwest Interactive conference. ""I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. And I saw the Constitution was being violated on a massive scale.""He warned, ""If we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government will accept that as a green light to do the same.""The chosen Twitter questions were notably nonconfrontational for a figure often the subject of heated debate even among supporters. One asked whether the mass surveillance was driven by privatization. Another wondered about the potential for society to ""reap benefits"" from the ""big data."" None asked about his life in Russia, or what further revelations might be coming.The first question came from Timothy John Berners-Lee, a British scientist known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, who asked Snowden how he would create an accountability system for governance.""We have an oversight model that could work. The problem is when the overseers are not interested in oversight,"" Snowden said. ""The key factor is accountability.""Onstage in Austin, lawyer Ben Wizner and ACLU principal technologist Chris Soghoian conversed with Snowden as he appeared on a big screen, an image of the U.S. Constitution superimposed behind him. The three agreed that an easier means for citizens to encrypt their data was a pressing need.""Most regular people are not going to download an obscure encryption app,"" Soghoian said. He also noted that ""without Ed's disclosures, a lot of tech companies would not have improved cybersecurity.""Snowden said, ""We need to think of encryption not as a dark art,"" and warned that the NSA was ""setting fire to the future of the Internet. And the people in this room, you guys, are the firefighters.""For his audience, Snowden's choice of the SXSW conference to directly address his peers in data technology was easy to understand.""You have people from every major media company, every major brand, every major agency,"" Ryan Kite, a director of digital strategy for Los Angeles-based marketing agency TVGla, said after Snowden's hourlong talk. ""Where else would you get a message like that out there to people who actually move and control the data?""He was insightful,"" Kite added. ""He made me think about privacy versus functionality. He was a good predictor about what's happening. We have a choice — which path do we go down? Do we go down that path of free and easy with no liberty and complete openness to all of our data? Or do we switch and take preventative measures and secure everything?""While not as excited a crowd as that gathered this week to hear Lena Dunham's keynote speech at the SXSW Film conference — that line was much longer — Snowden's audience was a nearly full house of 3,000. Tech registrants steadily entered the hall to hushed electronic music. In front of the stage, an artist drew a running comic on the issues being discussed.Hans Meier, a teacher of interactive design at Oslo School of Architecture and Design in Norway, said Snowden seemed ""like a sympathetic person. Maybe not as a leader. What he's done is such a breakthrough thing, and he's got so many enemies, so for him there will always be this buzz whenever he comes on. But he's broken ground for a lot of other people to speak out. He's made these companies actually tighten up the security.""Snowden has kept a low profile of late — he faces felony charges of espionage and theft of government property — and has said he won't return until the United States changes its whistle-blower protection laws.Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. has taken a strong stand against granting amnesty to Snowden, saying he caused harm to national security and should be held accountable. Holder has described him as a defendant, not a whistle-blower.Barton Gellman, a Washington Post reporter who has worked with Snowden, released a video of his own ahead of Snowden's appearance. He said Snowden wanted to speak with ""the people who are building and creating the next generation of the Internet"" because ""technologists"" are ""a group he wants to influence.""""He's looking for places where there can be reform"" to ""practices that he regards as overbroad and overly intrusive,"" Gellman said.steve.appleford@latimes.comTimes staff writer Molly Hennessy-Fiske in Houston contributed to this report."

UPDATED 11:00 EST . 10 MARCH 2014

This may not make me popular, but I am much more afraid of Google than I am of the NSA. Despite Edward Snowden’s revelations, for which I hope he will soon be prosecuted for treason, there isn’t evidence the NSA abused the information in ways that hurt normal Americans.It takes a whole lot of ego to believe that your privacy is more important than hunting down terrorists. If secretly monitoring my communications could protect us from incidents like the Boston bombing or even help bring El Chapo justice, sign me up.The caveat there is “secretly.” I don’t want know what’s being done. And that’s why I dislike Snowball the most: I was perfectly happy with my government’s sleuths going about their business and me going about mine. If they don’t abuse people, I’m cool.I am not sure any of us really needed to know most of what Snowden has revealed. And that he has revealed it and continues to breathe says a lot of good things about the country he’s trashed.My level-headedness, which some doubtless will see as stupid, blind faith, does not apply to Google, however. .I truly believe that in using Google’s products and services – which I use every day – we are striking a pact with the Devil.While the NSA is trying to protect me, Google is trying to learn as much as possible so its advertisers can sell me stuff. Further, I don’t know or understand what information Google has or what they really do with it. And if Google told me, I’d likely not trust them to provide the full story.Google has a page on its site entitled, “Ten Things We Know to Be True.” It is the lone page in a section called “What We Believe” and among the 1o items, the word “privacy” never appears.Item #6 “You Can Make Money Without Doing Evil” only discusses advertising standards, not how the company uses personal information it gathers to target advertising both on its own sites and others.Besides making sure that I am constantly followed by ads for seemingly every website I ever visit, what else is Google doing with its digital representation of me? The ads are obnoxious enough.There is a link on the “10 Things” page to Google’s privacy policy, which is easy enough to read but difficult to understand. It makes clear than information that Google gathers about us can be used in a variety of ways.What it doesn’t do is talk about whether using, say, Google Maps because I am lost allows Google to tell other services where I am. How use of Google services generates information used outside of Google is not clear. .While I don’t consider Eddie Snowden to be any sort of whistle-blower, given all the information he’s released that has nothing to do with spying on Americans, I am all for someone taking on Google.Many Google users share a deep suspicion of the company, that it is doing something that we’ve agreed to that if we really understood no one would agree to. Or that it is gathering information about us based on what someone else does, like capture a pic with their Google glasses or post a photo online.How far does Google go to correlate information between different individuals? Might it be using facial recognition on all the photos it indexes? Does it correlate my searches to those of my friends?If you are in a position to be Google’s Edward Snowden, please go to it. This sort of presumes that Google is doing stuff it wouldn’t do if we knew about it. This may not reach the level of illegality, but the company responsible for glasses with cameras has a strikingly high tolerance for creepiness.Google will say it offers privacy controls (and it does), but what percentage of users every access them, much less make a change? The company may also respond that this is a complex subject and making privacy simple also means reducing the details. That’s true, but Google needs to be doing more to help users understand all the privacy implications of using its services.This is where it may take an insider’s “unauthorized disclosures” to get Google to reveal more of its data practices. .Having said that, I am not trying to encourage illegality. Google has powerful attorneys and takes this secrecy stuff seriously. I do not want to have to visit you in jail. However, if there is something illegal going on…Frankly, I’d rather pay money for Google services than have the company gathering and selling information about me. In the future, the greatest luxury might become being off Google’s grid of personal information.Google should offer this option — an ad-free, non-tracking Google — that uses information in very specific ways and asks for permission before it does things. No, I don’t want a Google that is constantly asking me what to do, but I also don’t want a Google that holds onto my personal information and shares it with others.Right now, Google works for its advertisers — they pay the bills. I am not suggesting Google should become a totally paid service, but it definitely should allow customers to opt-out of being sold to advertisers if they are willing to pay a fee for the Google they use.Curiously, I have never had serious concerns about Microsoft. Partially, this is because I trusted Bill and Steve. Further, I know what businesses Microsoft is in and selling my soul isn’t one of them.Google has creeped me out since the first moment I heard that “don’t be evil” line. At the time, Google seemed like a benign force bringing me better search results. Yet, any company that has to remind itself to play nice, really doesn’t want to play nice.If Google had its very own Edward Snowden we might know what Google is really up to.

897	"Former security contractor Edward Snowden, addressing a sympathetic crowd at a tech-heavy event in Austin, Texas, on Monday from a secret location in Russia, said proposed reforms at the National Security Agency show that he was vindicated in leaking classified material.Snowden, who faces arrest if he steps foot on U.S. soil, spoke via a video link to a packed house at the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) gathering of tech industry experts, filmmakers and musicians. He said the U.S. government still has no idea what material he has provided to journalists.""I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,"" Snowden said to applause, adding that his revelations of government spying on private communications have resulted in protections that have benefited the public and global society.NSA officials declined to comment on the Snowden remarks.Last year, Snowden, who had been working at a NSA facility as an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, leaked a raft of secret documents that revealed a vast U.S. government system for monitoring phone and Internet data.The leaks deeply embarrassed the Obama administration, which in January banned U.S. eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly countries and allies and began reining in the sweeping collection of Americans' phone data in a series of limited reforms triggered by Snowden's revelations.Major companies also tightened up safeguards. But Snowden said the efforts are still not enough to protect privacy properly, calling for stepped-up encryption that would make mass government surveillance too costly to conduct.""The government has gone and changed their talking points. They have changed their verbiage away from public interest to national interest,"" he said, adding that this poses the risk of losing control of representative democracy.He said the government's priority has been an expansive and ill-executed system of massive information collection instead of protecting the vast amounts of intellectual property that support the U.S. economy.""We've got the most to lose from being hacked,"" Snowden said.U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, wrote to SXSW organizers, calling on them to withdraw the invitation to Snowden, who he said deceived his employer and his country.""Rewarding Mr. Snowden's behavior in this way encourages the very lawlessness he exhibited,"" Pompeo wrote.To many in government and at the NSA, Snowden is a traitor who compromised the security of the United States. But for many at the conference he is a hero who protected privacy and civil liberties.""To me, Snowden is a patriot who believed that what he did was in the best interests of his country,"" said Roeland Stekelenburg, creative director at the Dutch Internet firm Infostrada.Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he currently has asylum.

898	By John CassidyMarch 10, 2014Having been edged out by Pope Francis as Time’s Person of the Year, Edward Snowden, the N.S.A. whistle-blower in exile, suffered another minor indignity during his appearance, via Google Hangout, at the annual South by Southwest technology conference, in Austin, Texas, on Monday. “Line around the block for Lena Dunham panel. Walked right into the Edward Snowden panel,” Doug MacMillan, a technology reporter for the Wall Street Journal, tweeted shortly before both events started.Fortunately, nobody mentioned this to Snowden when he appeared on a large screen, live from Moscow, or St. Petersburg, or wherever he has been living for the past eight and a half months. He looked much like he did last summer, when he was photographed in Hong Kong: slim, bespectacled, goateed, and intense. Behind him, on a screen, there was a blowup of the preamble to the U.S. Constitution.His interlocutors were both from the American Civil Liberties Union, which, to its credit, has energetically taken up his defense: Ben Wizner, the director of its privacy and technology project, and Chris Soghoian, the organization’s chief technologist. In an interview with Forbes this weekend, Wizner said that Snowden had chosen to speak in this format, rather than to one of the broadcast networks, because he wanted to keep the focus on technology and policy. “Ed can still do the Oprah interview one day if that’s what he wants to do,” Wizner said. “But we’re not here to talk about his personal life, or what he does every day, or what any network journalist would have to ask. We’re here to talk about the issues. It’s a call to arms.”Snowden didn’t come with any new revelations about the N.S.A.’s activities, nor did he say anything about his life in Russia. But he backed up Wizner’s promise to talk about the issues: in his opening remarks, he said that governments, through their mass surveillance, had created an “adversarial Internet,” and that the appropriate response was more effective public policies and better technologies. “The N.S.A., the sort of global mass surveillance that’s occurring in all of these countries, not just the U.S.—and it’s important to remember this is a global issue—they’re setting fire to the future of the Internet,” Snowden said. “You guys in the room are the global firefighters, and we need you to help us fix this.” If the development community devoted itself to creating better encryption methods, Snowden added, it could “really crack those solutions and make sure we’re safe.”The non-techies in the audience may have found some of what Snowden said a bit obscure, but it wasn’t, really. The sort of encryption he was recommending is so-called end-to-end encryption, in which data is readable only by the receiving party—not by intermediaries, such as Internet-service providers and the intelligence services that intercept their traffic. Some tools of this nature are already available, but they can be complicated to use or costly to implement; commercial services like Gmail and Facebook don’t provide them. The key to progress, Snowden said, is developing cheaper and easier to use encryption methods, which could be incorporated into big e-mail and messaging systems. “It has to be out there,” he said. “It has to happen automatically. It has to happen seamlessly.”Many people believe that the N.S.A., if it decides to do so, can crack any encryption method. Soghoian, an expert in online security, said that this was generally true, but he nonetheless agreed with Snowden that the widespread adoption of end-to-end encryption would be a good thing. Breaking encrypted messages takes a lot of time and effort, he explained. If all online messages were encrypted properly, the N.S.A. would find it difficult to monitor large numbers of people. “Encryption makes bulk surveillance too expensive,” Soghoian said. Snowden, for his part, was even more optimistic about the promise of encryption. “The bottom line is that encryption does work,” he said. In support of this argument, he pointed to his own use of secure communications. Since he revealed to the world the inner workings of the N.S.A., the U.S. government has had a huge team trying to track him and his work, he said, but as far as he knew they hadn’t succeeded.Only the N.S.A. knows if that’s true, of course. (Even if the authorities had hacked Snowden’s accounts, they would surely have kept it secret.) But, in any case, Snowden managed to deliver an optimistic message about the possibilities of encryption without coming across as a techno-utopian. Throughout his remarks, he made clear that better coding was only part of the solution, and that more effective oversight of the intelligence agencies was also essential.About halfway through the event, Snowden took a question from Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, who thanked him for his disclosures and asked him what kind of surveillance and oversight model would work if one could be created from the ground up. “We need public oversight,” Snowden replied. “We need a watchdog that watches Congress, because if we’re not informed we can’t consent to these policies.” In the past, he said, one of the big problems had been “overseers who aren’t interested in oversight,” and he named James Clapper, President Obama’s Director of National Intelligence.Perhaps he was zeroing in on a soft target, but without Snowden’s revelations Clapper would almost certainly still be misleading the public, and Congress, in a most egregious manner. There would surely have been no White House or congressional reviews of the N.S.A.’s activities, no judicial finding that the bulk collection of telephone metadata was unconstitutional, and no efforts by companies like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo to beef up security and distance themselves from the N.S.A.“His disclosures have improved Internet security,” Soghoian noted, and not just from surveillance by the government but from hackers hanging out in Starbucks monitoring Wi-Fi.The last questions posed to Snowden, if not quite Oprah material, were a bit more personal: Was he satisfied with the debates that his revelations had engendered, and did he have any regrets? Snowden said that his aim had been to inform the public, not change the government, and that’s what had happened: the people had benefitted. “Would I do it again?” he went on. “Absolutely yes, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. And I saw that the Constitution was being violated on a massive scale.” The N.S.A.’s surveillance programs had taken the Constitution’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures and turned it into “any seizure is fine, just don’t search it,” he said.Quite what that last comment meant, I’m not sure, but the message had gotten across, and most of the people in the auditorium applauded loudly. For the first time, a hint of a smile crossed Snowden’s face. He’s still got a criminal complaint from the U.S. government to deal with, but, as far as the tech world goes, he’s already the winner.Above: Edward Snowden speaks, via videoconference, at South by Southwest; Austin, Texas, March, 2014.

	 AUSTIN, Texas -- National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden says he has no regrets about revealing the agency's mass surveillance program.
	Snowden spoke Monday via live video conference to a packed audience at the South By Southwest Interactive Festival.
	The former NSA contractor, who remains in Moscow living in temporary asylum, faces felony charges in the U.S. after leaking thousands of classified documents to media outlets.
	Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, spoke to Snowden from the Austin, Texas, event along with Snowden's legal adviser, the ACLU's Ben Wizner.
	Snowden touched on a number of issues in the hour-long conversation. He dispensed advice on how U.S. citizens can keep their web-surfing activities more private by using a free service called Tor, which encrypts web traffic. He also called on the technology industry to create more software and services that help guard individual privacy.
	He appeared to have no regrets about exposing the U.S. government's surveillance methods.
	""And when it comes to would I do this again, the answer is absolutely yes,"" he told the audience.
	""I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,"" he added.
	The ACLU offered a live blog of Snowden's talk on its website and the Texas Tribune's website hosted a live video stream.
	Fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke at the SXSW conference in a similar manner on Saturday. Assange is living in asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.AdvertisementDid you capture some amazing images or video?

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden says the United States' spy agency has helped find or create loopholes in New Zealand law to enable widespread spying.    In testimony to the European Parliament, the exiled former NSA worker said the agency's Foreign Affairs Division put pressure on other countries to change laws to create legal gaps through which mass surveillance could be carried out.    He said lawyers at the United Kingdom's GCHQ were also engaged in finding loopholes and both agencies slipped changes past unwitting politicians.    ""In recent public memory, we have seen these FAD 'legal guidance' operations occur in both Sweden and the Netherlands, and also faraway New Zealand.""    Mr Snowden offered no further detail in his testimony about pressure placed on New Zealand. His written testimony was sent ahead of a EU debate on freezing data agreements with the US.    It has been linked to new legislation passed in New Zealand last year which changed the laws governing the electronic spying agency, the GCSB, to allow it to spy on Kiwis. The government also passed legislation which extended the bureau's powers over intercepting information sent and received in New Zealand.    Mr Snowden told the EU Parliament: ""One of the foremost activities of the NSA's FAD, or Foreign Affairs Division, is to pressure or incentivise EU member states to change their laws to enable mass surveillance.    ""These efforts to interpret new powers out of vague laws is an intentional strategy to avoid public opposition and lawmakers' insistence that legal limits be respected, effects the GCHQ internally described in its own documents as 'damaging public debate'.""    The changes were used to ""justify indiscriminate, dragnet surveillance operations"", he said.    In listing New Zealand among countries targeted, he said: ""Each of these countries received instruction from the NSA, sometimes under the guise of the US Department of Defense and other bodies, on how to degrade the legal protections of their countries' communications.""    Cyber rights group Tech Liberty's spokesman Thomas Beagle said the new laws introduced in New Zealand last year appeared surprisingly quickly.    ""It was like someone had it sitting in a drawer ready to go. Who is really writing these laws.""    He said the greater concern was the lack of oversight. ""It's never being able to test what they are doing what they say.""    - David Fisher of the New Zealand Herald "	Science
901	"Fugitive Edward Snowden, speaking via webcast to Americans in Austin, Texas, said Monday his leaks about NSA surveillance programs led to better communications security, whereas NSA leaders' actions jeopardized national security.An unrepentant Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who during the past year leaked thousands of top-secret documents to news organizations, on Monday refuted US officials' assertions that his revelations about America's mass-surveillance apparatus had damaged national security and said his acts had benefited the public worldwide.Mr. Snowden, a fugitive who has been granted temporary sanctuary in Russia, made his comments during his first live discussion with a US audience, conducted via Internet webcast. He said he would leak the information again, despite his exile.Presumably speaking from Russia, Snowden also urged greater use of encryption in everyday online communications so as to combat mass surveillance by governments worldwide, and said his actions had already helped to buttress such efforts.His immediate audience was a group of US technologists meeting in Austin, Texas, at the South By Southwest (SXSW) Interactive Festival. They interrupted Snowden with applause at several points as he laid out a defense of his actions, familiar to anyone who has read his ""manifesto"" or his recent testimony to the European Union.“When I went public with this, it wasn’t so I could single-handedly change the government or tell them what to do or override what the public thinks is proper,” he said. “I wanted to inform the public so they could make a decision, [so] they could provide their consent for what we should be doing.”Two representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union, Ben Wizner and Chris Soghoian, tossed questions – some of them softballs – to Snowden via Twitter. At the start, Mr. Wizner noted that US Rep. Mike Pompeo (R) of Kansas had asked SXSW organizers to revoke their invitation to Snowden on grounds it would ""encourage lawlessness."" Conference organizers declined the request, Wizner said.Snowden used the occasion to pointedly rebut congressional testimony by current National Security Agency director Keith Alexander and former NSA director Michael Hayden that his actions – and news stories resulting from the document leaks – had damaged US national security. They, not he, are the ones who harmed it, Snowden said.“The government has never said any single one of these stories has risked a human life. The result is that the public is benefited, the government is benefited, and every society in the world is benefited. We are in a more secure place,” Snowden said. “We have more secure communication and a better sort of civic interaction as a result of understanding what’s being done in our name.”After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Snowden said, the NSA under Alexander and Hayden unduly emphasized the creation of offensive surveillance systems designed to infiltrate communications – and that this had essentially created a “back door” to America’s own communications, weakening US defenses against cyber spying by foreign adversaries.“They began eroding the protections of our communications in order to get an attack advantage,” he said. “This is a problem for one primary reason: America has more to lose that anyone else....  It doesn’t make any sense, ... when you set the standards for vaults worldwide, to have a big back door that anybody can walk into. And that’s what we’re talking about today.”The leaks of top-secret documents have led to a vigorous global public debate about government mass surveillance, intensive examination within the US, and Internet communications that are more secure, as social networking firms such as Facebook, Google, and Yahoo boosted encryption protections, Snowden said. That, in turn, can make mass surveillance more costly, he said. A higher cost would not prevent intelligence agencies from doing their job, but it would force them to conduct targeted investigations instead of intrusive mass surveillance against the public.“We have more secure communications and a better sort of civic interaction as a result of understanding what’s being done in our name,"" Snowden said. “So when it comes to would I do this again, the answer is absolutely yes, regardless of what happens to me.”One questioner, in a tweet, asked, “Why is it less bad if big corporations get metadata rather than the government?” – highlighting a proposal to let companies, rather than government, hold consumer data for investigation.“This is why we need to have this conversation, because we don’t know,” Snowden said. “Right now, my thinking, and I believe the majority, is thinking that government has the ability to deprive you of rights. Government around the world, whether it’s the US government, the Yemeni government ... any country ... they have police powers, military power, intelligence powers.... Companies can surveil you to sell you products, sell information to other companies, and that can be bad, but you have [legal] remedies.”Snowden’s voice was garbled frequently because the communication had been sent through numerous nodes around the world, apparently to throw off anyone trying to locate his specific whereabouts.With the “We the People...” preamble to the US Constitution as a backdrop, Snowden said his conscience is what drove him to abscond with documents and then release them.“I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I saw that the Constitution was being violated on a massive scale,” he said, to applause. The interpretation of the Fourth Amendment had been changed in secret from no unreasonable search and seizure to, ‘hey, any seizure is fine, just don’t search it.’ And that’s something the public ought to know.”Snowden’s critics are not likely to be much mollified by his comments. Stewart Baker, former legal counsel for the NSA, was underwhelmed.“It’s sort of astonishing that you can talk for an hour today about the evils of surveillance and not once talk about the blood in Independence Square in the Ukraine, mass surveillance at the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, or what’s happening in Crimea right this minute,” Mr. Baker says in a phone interview, speaking of Russia, Snowden's host country.“When Snowden says the Internet is being burned by surveillance, one question has to be what he thinks about China’s more pervasive and obvious surveillance,"" he continues. ""It raises questions about whether his objections are principled or are blaming America first even though other governments are far worse offenders.”Some civil libertarians say some of Snowden's remarks ring true.“Snowden made an interesting point when he said that the Fourth Amendment was secretly reinterpreted to allow the seizure of private data as long as the government promises not to search all of it,” writes Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program at NYU School of Law, in an e-mail interview.""The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has indeed placed too much trust in the NSA to police its own access to Americans' information,” she writes. “Our government should have to show that it has reason to suspect wrongdoing before collecting our personal information, not after.”

904	"Snowden said his leaks have made the US safer.Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden spoke via internet link on a panel at the South by Southwest Conference (SXSW) in Austin today. If you were hoping for fresh revelations, or probing questions about his motivations and decisions, you would have been disappointed. His fellow panelists were Ben Wizner and Chris Sogohian of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), but Mr. Snowden, sitting in front of a screen with the US Constitution emblazoned across it, was the star of the show.What did Mr. Snowden, currently residing in Russia to avoid arrest at home, have to say?Snowden said the US needs some new kind of ""public oversight"" of its intelligence community. ""We need a watchdog that watches Congress, because if we're not informed, we can't consent to these (government) policies,"" he said.Well, there is a watchdog for the US Congress, the president, and the various arms of the federal government they fund and regulate. That watchdog is called voters. You can argue that elected representatives have failed to adequately carry out their duties (or not), but trying to find a way around electoral democracy, warts and all, that leads to better protection of individual liberty is a problem that has bedeviled political philosophers for generations.He attacked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court that provides secret warrants for surveillance inside the country as a ""rubber stamp"" for US intelligence and law enforcement (never mind that just today the court denied an NSA request to hold on to telephone metadata indefinitely). A criticism that the court is generally far too friendly to requests from the NSA and others would be far from unreasonable. But, again, American voters do in fact have it in their power to change this. Or they could continue to vote in favor of the politicians who have presided over the expansion of domestic surveillance in the years since 9/11.This assertion was arguably Snowden's most risible. He claimed that the NSA's bulk collection of metadata distracted the agency from focusing on terrorists and as a result, the Tsarnaev brothers were able to attack the Boston Marathon last year. He also asserted that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called underwear bomber caught trying to bomb a Northwest Airlines flight in 2009, likewise was able to board the plane because of this distraction.This is nonsense. It's true that Russia contacted the FBI about one of the Tsarnaev brothers in 2011 and warned that he had contacts to militant Islamist circles in the former Soviet Union. But it's also true that the FBI looked into it at the time, including visiting the family home in Cambridge, and found no evidence of any criminal activity.If the US was in fact the Orwellian hell-scape of surveillance and trampling of civil liberties that many of Snowden's supporters seem to think it is (or maybe just a little bit more like Russia), perhaps the brothers would have been indefinitely detained, or placed under permanent surveillance. But, well, there are laws against that, so two young men who went on to attack the marathon two years later were left alone.Many people who have worked in or studied the US intelligence community have worried for years that the US is becoming overly reliant on technical data collection rather than human intelligence (AKA ""old fashioned"" spying). And if that was his point, he'd have received a chorus of ""preach it, brother"" even from corners within CIA and NSA headquarters.But the claim that automated metadata collection stands in the way of better human intelligence – or better analysis of information, whatever its source – is simply not supported by fact. That database is queried when an individual or group is targeted because they've appeared on spies' radar. While the picture of NSA staffers spending their days looking at citizens' dirty pictures and idly trawling through metadata to figure out where so-and-so had lunch last Friday is an amusing one, it isn't true.Snowden asserted that the vast number of documents he stole – at least 50,000 – and the disclosures connected to them have made the US safer. This is a rather extreme and almost certainly false assertion. While it's one thing to argue a principle – a little less security is worth it for a little more personal liberty or privacy – the disclosure of the means and methods of the NSA (and its counterparts in the UK and Australia) has made it easier for foreign intelligence targets – governments and non-state actors alike – to evade detection. One of his leaks, for instance, explained the technical means the NSA was using to track Al Qaeda operatives in and around Mosul, Iraq.There are also concerns about the proliferation of documents he took, and what they might contain. Snowden insists that the documents he took can't end up in the hands of foreign powers. But there's no particular reason to assume he's right. Finally, here are a few questions I would have asked if I could of Snowden: ""If your principal concern was what you took to be violations of the US Constitution, why steal and release so many documents that disclose uncontroversially legal surveillance on foreign targets by the NSA?"" ""Why not get in touch with the US government and provide a full accounting of everything you stole, to assist the US with damage assessment from the leaks? ""How could you have possibly vetted and reviewed all the documents you stole? The numbers involved seem impossible for you to have come to grips with in the time available."" And ""How do you feel about having taken asylum in Russia, a country that has a much poorer record when it comes to civil liberties and the surveillance of its citizens than the US?

The leaks have global political implications, and President Obama has vowed to reform spying practices.But at SXSW, the message was more about companies, which  haven’t necessarily paid much attention to security even since the disclosures, according to Christopher Soghoian, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union, who shared the stage with Snowden. According to Soghoian, commercial software isn’t as secure as it should be. For many companies “security is an afterthought, if it’s a thought at all,” he said. “That is what has enabled global surveillance by the U.S. and other countries.”The crowd at SXSW was immensely sympathetic to Snowden, who was referred to as “Ed” by moderators and was cheered several times. He’s not just a civil rights whistleblower anymore. He’s a motivational speaker. As Snowden told the crowd:There is a policy response that needs to occur. But there is also a technical response. And it’s the makers, the thinkers, it’s the development community, that can really craft the solution, that have to do it.Not everyone is happy with Snowden’s stardom. Prior to the conference, U.S. congressman Mike Pompeo, also a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, sent a letter to organizers, calling Snowden a “traitor” and wondering why the onetime “systems administrator” was being touted as an expert on privacy and surveillance.“Mr. Snowden cares more about personal fame than personal privacy,” Pompeo wrote.Snowden doesn’t give that impression. He is a clear, thoughtful speaker and, in many ways, restrained in his remarks. He keeps making the same few points. Officials lied to Congress about NSA surveillance, prompting him to leak the documents. Also, he says, encryption technology is the best way to foil large-scale eavesdropping.Indeed, in the eight months since Snowden’s revelations began, many large companies have expanded their use of encryption, including Yahoo, which previously had left users’ e-mail vulnerable to government snoops. They ended up collecting messages and webcam images with ease.According to Soghoian, this change in corporate behavior is one of the biggest effects of Snowden’s coming forward: There are people [who] think Ed is wrong. But let me be clear about one thing. Ed’s disclosure has improved Internet security, and not only from bulk government surveillance, but also from common identity thieves and stalkers. It took the largest and most profound whistleblower in history to get these companies to finally prioritize security.That’s not to say the security problem is solved. The business model of large companies is to collect consumer information and repackage or resell it for advertising. That means they aren’t too interested in the very toughest forms of security and encryption, which aren’t user friendly and could complicate their business models.But Soghoian said that people in industry, especially cryptography experts at large companies who implement security schemes, are very angry about government snooping and have become “radicalized” by the NSA revelations.The tools that come out in the next years will be much more secure and that is because the people in that part of the tech community feel like they were lied to.We have Ed Snowden to thank for that.

908	"Washington: America's spy agencies are so focused on ""mass surveillance"" that they have missed clues about terrorist incidents, such as last year's Boston Marathon bombing and an attempted attack on an aircraft at Christmas in 2009, former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden says.In an hour-long video discussion on Monday hosted by the South by Southwest music, film and technology conference in Austin, Texas, Mr Snowden, who is living in asylum at an undisclosed location in Russia, asserted that the US National Security Agency's efforts to collect information in bulk have backfired.""We've actually had a tremendous intelligence failure because ... we're monitoring everybody's communications instead of suspects' communications"" - a situation, he asserts, that has ""caused us to miss"" intelligence.Mr Snowden, who faces criminal espionage charges for disclosing top-secret documents to journalists, has prompted a global debate about surveillance and forced the US government to be more transparent about once-classified programs.His actions have drawn harsh criticism from senior US officials, who contend that the leaks have put national security at risk, but approval from technologists and privacy advocates, who say the leaks have forced technology companies to make their systems more secure.""Let me be clear about one thing,"" said American Civil Liberties Union principal technologist Christopher Soghoian, one of two ACLU representatives who took part in the discussion with Mr Snowden: ""His disclosures have improved internet security.""Mr Snowden, who was using a Google videoconferencing program that ran through seven proxy servers to mask his location, used much of his talk to urge companies and technologists to develop and adopt easier-to-use encryption. ""It has to happen seamlessly,"" he said.Get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.By submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's

                and
                privacy policy.
            If ""you encrypt your hardware and your network"", Mr Snowden said, ""it becomes very difficult for any mass surveillance ... You'll still be vulnerable to targeted surveillance. If there's a warrant for you, the NSA will still get you.""Encryption, he said, enabled him to protect the information he took from the NSA, where he worked until last year. US officials ""still have no idea of what documents were provided to journalists, what they have and don't have"", he said, ""because encryption works"".He also said that neither the Chinese nor the Russian governments possess any of the information he took. The intelligence failures Mr Snowden alleged are not clear-cut. The Christmas 2009 bomb attempt involved a failure to connect and understand the information agencies possessed. In the Boston case, the FBI followed up on a tip from Russian authorities about a suspect but found insufficient grounds to open a criminal investigation.General Keith Alexander, the outgoing director of the NSA, has vigorously defended the agency's activities. ""The press has articulated them as the villains, when what they're doing is protecting this country and doing what we have asked them to do,"" he told US Congress last month. ""And if they've made a mistake, we find out.'' During the videoconference, an image of the US constitution provided a background for Mr Snowden. The session was conducted by ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner, Mr Snowden's legal adviser.Asked by Mr Wizner whether the price he has paid for his disclosures has been worth it, Mr Snowden said: ""Regardless of what's happening to me, this is something we have a right to know. I took an oath to support the constitution, and I felt the constitution was violated on a massive scale. The interpretation of the constitution has been changed in secret from 'no unreasonable search and seizure' to: 'Hey, any seizure is fine. Just don't search it.' That's something the public ought to know about.""Washington PostSave articles for later.Subscribe for unlimited access to news.

		Friday 09 February 2018 Joanna Walters in New York8:45PM GMT 10 Mar 2014 The fugitive American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden has made a rare public appearance by video link from exile in Russia on Monday, calling for citizen oversight of the American government to prevent it spying on the public.  Mr Snowden was beamed onto a screen at a technology conference in Texas standing in front of a projection of the US Constitution prominently displaying the opening words: “We, the people…”.  He has rarely been seen since he took refuge in Russia last summer after leaking thousands of classified documents revealing that the US government was secretly gathering the telephone records of almost every US citizen – and also that it could infiltrate private computer systems around the world and was even listening in to world leaders’ mobile phones.  Mr Snowden called on technology experts, entrepreneurs and leading internet companies such as Google and Yahoo to create automatic safeguards on telephone and online communications and applications, in order to protect users from invisible government surveillance.  A question sent in to Mr Snowden from a member of the public asked if he felt the leaks had been worth his forced flight to Russia and precarious future.

 “Absolutely. I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution and I saw that it was being violated on a massive scale,” he said, to applause from the audience.  Mr Snowden appeared by live video link in the technology section of the South By South West music, film and interactive festival in Austin, Texas, on Monday afternoon before an audience of around 3,000.  Opinion on Mr Snowden is sharply divided. He is variously abelled a traitor or a patriot. The US government charged him with espionage and theft and revoked his passport after he fled to Hong Kong and then Russia last year.  Mr Snowden gave no news during his video link of his hopes to take refuge in Europe or South America.  He accused the US National Security Agency, for which he used to work as a private-sector contractor, of turning the internet into an “adversarial” medium, which was a “free zone” for governments to practice the secret, ""proactive seizure"" of the public’s communications.  “They are setting fire to the future of the internet and you guys who are in this room now are the firefighters,” he said, referring to the technology entrepreneurs and executives packing the audience in Texas.  He called for technology companies to include automatic encryption of communications such as emails, texts and phone calls as well as better privacy from the government for consumers using social media websites like Facebook or online services like Skype.  “By improving encryption we force government agents to target the individual computers so if they want to access someone’s communications they have to target them specifically…they cannot just gather them en masse,” he said.  The first question that was channelled to Snowden via the conference came from Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the British physicist who created the World Wide Web for global information sharing online in the early-nineties.  He asked Mr Snowden what he would change about the US government’s surveillance system.  Mr Snowden said he did not trust the US Congress to keep a check on the National Security Agency or other branches of the intelligence community.  “We need public oversight, some way for trusted public figures to advocate for us. We need a watchdog that watches Congress,” he said.  At the end of an hour-long appearance punctuated with some technology delays, the audience gave Mr Snowden a standing ovation.

                Snowden’s first live video Q-and-A was just the latest in a series of outings.
            By JOSH GERSTEIN03/10/2014 10:33 PM EDT
                    Updated 03/11/2014 12:37 PM EDTFirst, National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden popped up in Hong Kong. Then, Russia. By Monday, the fugitive from justice, a man regularly accused of treason, was in Austin, Texas, hitting the nation’s hottest tech festival — via the Web, of course.  “They’re setting fire to the future of the Internet,” Snowden warned darkly, in jerky video relayed through a series of proxies from an undisclosed location in Russia. With an image of the U.S. Constitution projected behind him, he urged the tech-savvy SXSW attendees to ride to the rescue against rampant surveillance by the NSA and others. “The people who are in this room, now, you guys are all the firefighters, and we need you to help fight this,” he said, sounding every bit the geek as he described various encryption applications he believes should get wider use. Story Continued Below Snowden was painstaking in how he assembled a huge trove of top-secret documents while working as a tech contractor at an NSA facility in Hawaii. And he’s been equally deliberate in the way he and the team around him have crafted and cultivated his public image — controlling and carefully managing how he’s been perceived by the public in the months since he burst into the spotlight. It’s an endeavor that’s involved everything from coordinated efforts to beat back Obama administration attacks to the careful parceling out of tantalizing tidbits about his everyday life.  ( WATCH: Edward Snowden speaks at SXSW festival)  “It’s interesting … usually people who do what he did are instantly and very effectively demonized across the board,” said Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who received a massive stash of NSA documents from Snowden and has published a series of attention-grabbing stories. “He’s really been able to control his own image.”  At the SXSW festival Monday, the 30-year-old computer engineer and his team tried to tap into one of his biggest assets: the support of leaders in America’s tech industry who have recoiled at his revelations of widespread government snooping that poses a threat to their global business.  Snowden’s first live video Q-and-A was just the latest in a series of outings that has included a text-based Web chat with his followers, as well as interviews or online exchanges with a German TV network and with reporters for The New York Times and The Washington Post. Video was posted online of him accepting an award in Moscow from a group of former U.S. intelligence agency employees who are self-described whistleblowers. And just last week, he made a stir with written testimony to a European Union inquiry in which he accused the U.S. of creating a “bazaar” to spy on Europeans.  There have also been stories about his Moscow apartment and his employment with a Russian Internet firm.  ( Also on POLITICO: Edward Snowden: Hill, FISA need watchdog)  And on Tuesday, he emerged to take a swipe at congressional critic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) after she accused the CIA of interfering in Senate Intelligence Committee oversight. “It’s clear the CIA was trying to play ‘keep away’ with documents relevant to an investigation by their overseers in Congress, and that’s a serious constitutional concern,” Snowden said, in a statement to NBC News that was confirmed by a Snowden associate. “But it’s equally if not more concerning that we’re seeing another ‘Merkel Effect,’ where an elected official does not care at all that the rights of millions of ordinary citizens are violated by our spies, but suddenly it’s a scandal when a politician finds out the same thing happens to them.”  In interviews with POLITICO, three top advisers to Snowden said they’re pleased with and somewhat surprised by his relative popularity — a popularity that persists despite the fact that U.S. officials regularly accuse him of being a traitor and a spy, and despite the three felonies he’s been formally charged with for stealing and disclosing secrets.  Polls show a substantial base of support for Snowden’s actions, but how large a base he has appears to vary widely depending on the precise wording of questions. In a January Quinnipiac survey, 57 percent of Americans branded him a “whistleblower,” while 34 percent called him a “traitor.” A total of 40 percent of those answering said his disclosures had been good for the country, but 46 percent said they were bad.  ( Also on POLITICO: Snowden still stirring the political pot)  A Fox News poll taken the same month found 68 percent of Americans were glad to know about the NSA programs Snowden revealed, while a CBS survey found those disapproving of Snowden’s conduct outnumbered those approving, 54 to 31 percent.  Snowden’s challenge: ‘Like turning the Titanic’  Greenwald said Snowden actually gained momentum early on by making the unorthodox decision to identify himself, rather than lurk in the shadows and be introduced to the public through news accounts stemming from the inevitable investigation.  “He was able to define himself in the public eye rather than letting the first enduring impression of who he was be defined by the smear campaign that begins once a person gets fingered,” said the Brazil-based American writer, who recently decamped from the Guardian to startup Firstlook Media. Now, “he definitely has been participating more in the debate — which he also started,” said Greenwald, who regularly leaps to the ex-NSA contractor’s defense on Twitter.  Snowden legal adviser Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union also credits the former NSA contractor’s measured public statements with his success in bolstering his substantial base of support.  “Snowden has come forward, not giving the Barbara Walters interview, but he has calmly and eloquently explained what he did and why it was necessary to do that,” Wizner said.  Another adviser, Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project, said building Snowden’s public brand has been challenging — particularly since the Justice Department has charged him under the Espionage Act with disclosing classified information and information about “communications intelligence” operations.  ( Also on POLITICO: Full defense policy coverage)  “It is like turning the Titanic when you have a client who’s charged with espionage, which automatically paints him as an enemy of the state,” said Radack, who sees the trend moving Snowden’s way. “It’s been positive. … Ed was in the running to be Time’s person of the year — and lost to the pope. I feel like the tide has turned drastically since last June.”  There’s no doubt that Snowden’s actions are also passing out of the usual realm of news coverage and into pop culture. CBS’s legal drama “The Good Wife” has already done one episode on his NSA revelations and is planning another. And students at the University of Glasgow paid tribute to Snowden last month by electing him as their rector.  ‘He has a spotlight, and he’s using it’  Snowden’s relative public support is clearly galling to many veteran national security and law enforcement officials, who view his behavior as reckless and insist he’s done profound damage to U.S. interests. They also sense and resent a kind of cult of personality developing around the internationally celebrated tech geek.  “I hear people talk about whistleblower-hero for revealing — I say, for revealing what?” FBI Director James Comey said in a recent roundtable with reporters. Invoking his own history of sharply resisting what he regarded as illegal aspects of Bush administration surveillance programs, Comey painted Snowden’s actions as quite different — exposing a call-tracking database known to and approved by members of all three branches of government. “When I look at that program, I see the government operating in the way the founders intended.”  Comey also faulted Snowden for the breadth of his disclosures, saying they went beyond matter that raised legitimate privacy concerns. “When you’re talking about revealing the ways in which we track terrorists or the identity and location of agents, I struggle to understand how you can apply the whistleblower label to that kind of information. And so it confuses me,” the FBI director said.  “There’s some element of sympathy out there for him, and some have jumped to lionizing Snowden. I think that’s problematic,” former Assistant Attorney General for National Security Ken Wainstein said during a Georgetown University conference last month. “If people see that folks can unilaterally decide that they’re going to leak information that they disagree with and violate their oath, then I think our national security system doesn’t work. … That’s why I think it’s important that, to the extent we’re able down the road to bring Snowden to justice, that we do so.”  “He is now regaling the world with interviews and other kinds of public relations things,” former judge and Homeland Security Secretary Mike Chertoff said in a January NBC interview. “This is not a person being punished. He has a spotlight and he’s using it.” Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.

913	"NSA leaker Edward Snowden, speaking via live video conference Monday, told a packed audience at the South By Southwest Interactive Festival that he had no regrets and acted because he believed the U.S. Constitution had been ""violated on a massive scale.""The former NSA contractor, who remains in Moscow living in temporary asylum, faces felony charges in the U.S. after revealing the agency's mass surveillance program by leaking thousands of classified documents to media outlets.Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, spoke to Snowden from the Austin event along with Snowden's legal adviser, the ACLU's Ben Wizner.Snowden touched on a number of issues in the hour-long conversation. He dispensed advice on how U.S. citizens can keep their web-surfing activities more private by using a free service called Tor, which encrypts web traffic. He also called on the technology industry to create more software and services that help guard individual privacy.He appeared to have no regrets about exposing the U.S. government's surveillance methods.""And when it comes to would I do this again, the answer is absolutely yes,"" he told the audience.""I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,"" he added.The ACLU offered a live blog of Snowden's talk on its website and the Texas Tribune's website hosted a live video stream.Fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke at the SXSW conference in a similar manner on Saturday. Assange is living in asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.Documents released over the past year by Snowden have revealed that the NSA sweeps up millions of Americans' phone and Internet records. The subsequent controversy has led President Barack Obama to ask agencies and Congress to consider some reforms.On Monday, Germany dismissed a claim by Snowden that it had buckled under American demands that it undermine privacy rights for German citizens.Snowden, in a statement published Friday, told the European Parliament that Germany was pressured to modify its legislation on wiretapping and other forms of lawful telecoms surveillance. He didn't elaborate on how the laws were changed or when, but suggested it was standard practice for the NSA to instruct friendly nations on how to ""degrade the legal protections of their countries' communications.""Last week, the top U.S. military officer said it would take two years of study and billions of dollars to overcome the loss of security to military operations and tactics that were revealed in the massive stash of documents taken by Snowden.COMMENTS WELCOME

915	"FBI(AUSTIN, Texas) — National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden said Monday that rather than helping combat terrorism, the U.S. government’s massive surveillance programs have led to “tremendous intelligence failures” and may have contributed to allowing the deadly Boston Marathon bombing to have taken place.“We’re monitoring everybody’s communications, instead of suspects’ communications,” Snowden said during a live video conference at Austin’s popular South by Southwest festival. “That lack of focus has caused us to miss leads that we should’ve had. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the Boston bombers, the Russians had warned us about him….And if we hadn’t spent so much on mass surveillance, if we had followed the traditional models, we might’ve caught him.”In 2011 Russian intelligence requested the FBI and CIA to separately help them investigate Tamerlan’s possible ties to Islamic extremism. Months later, the FBI closed their investigation after concluding that Tamerlan did not pose a threat.In April 2013, authorities allege Tamerlan and his little brother Dzhokhar set off a pair of bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring more than 260 others. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police days later, and Dzhokhar was arrested and has pleaded not guilty to terrorism-related charges. He could face the death penalty. The New York Times reported weeks after the bombing that the FBI concluded there was little the Bureau could have done to prevent the attacks.Snowden also referred to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the young man who tried to blow up an airplane over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 with explosives hidden in his underwear. Abdulmutallab’s father attempted to warn U.S. officials that he had concerns about his son prior to the attack, but despite his father’s worry, Abdulmutallab was not placed on a no-fly list. The other passengers of that plane Christmas Day were only saved when they noticed Abdulmutallab attempting to light his explosives and subdued him themselves.A spokesperson for the CIA, the agency which was approached by Abdulmutallab’s father, called into question Snowden’s general theory, telling ABC News the agency doesn’t “put a lot of stock in Snowden’s tips for improving our intelligence capabilities.”“The Agency is a versatile global organization that is more than capable of addressing a range of national security threats simultaneously and it does so every day,” the spokesperson said. “Anyone suggesting otherwise is seriously misinformed.”In testimony before lawmakers, the heads of American law enforcement and intelligence agencies have defended various NSA surveillance programs, and the head of the NSA, Gen. Keith Alexander, claimed the surveillance programs had played a role in the thwarting of more than 50 terrorist “terror-related activities” worldwide. In the case of Abdulmutallab, a Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2010 criticized the NSA for not doing enough – for not pursuing “potential collection opportunities that could have provided information” on the would-be terrorist.However, last December an outside expert panel convened by the White House to review the surveillance programs found that the NSA’s most controversial collection program – so-called Section 215 for the relevant portion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act – was “not essential to preventing attacks” and presented a “lurking danger of abuse.” The panel made 46 recommendations to how the government should change the way it watches the world, some of which the White House has said it will follow, while others remain under consideration.Snowden said he was speaking at SXSW, in his first live video conference since fleeing to Moscow, because he wanted to talk directly to the tech developers that could make communications more secure through their programs, rather than waiting on a lumbering government to change policy. With enhanced and encrypted communication tools, Snowden said it would be too difficult for the NSA to sweep up information on everyone’s communications and therefore would be forced to put their resources into spying on people they believe actually pose a threat.The 30-year-old also said that he doesn’t mind major telecom companies, rather than the NSA, temporarily holding information on customers’ communications information, as proposed by the White House panel, because it’s only the government that has authority over the rights of its citizens.Snowden, a former contractor with Booz Allen who worked at a secure NSA facility in Hawaii, revealed himself as the source of the massive NSA leak last June while in hiding in Hong Kong. From there, he slipped to Moscow, where he was granted temporary asylum. A slew of media reports on the NSA’s foreign and domestic programs has followed, with no end in sight.Snowden has been charged in the U.S. with espionage-related crimes and has said he believes he will not be afforded a fair trial should he return. And though privacy advocates call him a hero while critics deride him as a traitor, Snowden said he would do it all over again if he had to.“When it comes to, would I do this again, the answer is ‘Absolutely, yes,’” Snowden said Monday. “Regardless of what is done to me….This is something we have the right to know.”Representatives for the FBI did not immediately respond to request for comment for this report. The NSA declined to comment.Copyright 2014 ABC News Radio© 2015 - 2018

Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, and Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the ACLU joined the former NSA contractor from the stage in Austin.“The people who are in the room in Austin right now, they are the folks who can enforce our rights through technical standards even when Congress hasn’t yet gotten to the point of creating legislation to protect our rights in that same manner,” Snowden, set against a Constitution of the United States wallpaper, began. “It’s the makers, it’s the thinkers, it’s the developer community who can help make sure we're safe.""Here’s the video below along with a few highlights to help you through.

Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower whose unprecedented leak of top-secret documents led to a worldwide debate about the nature of surveillance, insisted on Monday that his actions had improved the national security of the United States rather than undermined it, and declared that he would do it all again despite the personal sacrifices he had endured.In remarks to the SXSW culture and technology conference in Texas, delivered by video link from his exile in Russia, Snowden took issue with claims by senior officials that he had placed the US in danger. He also rejected as demonstrably false the suggestions by some members of Congress that his files had found their way into the hands of the intelligence agencies of China or Russia.Snowden spoke against the backdrop of an image of the US constitution, which he said he had taken an oath to protect but had seen “violated on a mass scale” while working for the US government. He accepted praise from Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, accorded the first question via Twitter, who described him as “acting profoundly in the public interest”.The session provided a rare and extensive glimpse into the thoughts of Snowden, granted temporary asylum by Russia after the US revoked his passport. He struck back strongly against claims made again last week by the NSA director, General Keith Alexander, that his release of secret documents to the Guardian and other outlets last year had weakened American cyber-defences.“These things are improving national security, these are improving the communications not just of Americans, but everyone in the world,” Snowden said. “Because we rely on the same standard, we rely on the ability to trust our communications, and without that, we don’t have anything.”He added later that thanks to the more secure communication activity that had been encouraged by his disclosures, “the public has benefited, the government has benefited, and every society in the world has benefited”.Snowden rejected claims that potential adversaries of the US, such as Russia and China, had obtained the files he had been carrying. “That has never happened, and it is never going to happen. If suddenly the Chinese government knew everything the NSA was doing, we would notice the difference,” said Snowden, noting that US infiltration of Russia and China was extensive.He sharply criticised Alexander and Michael Hayden, his predecessor as NSA director, as the two officials to have most “harmed our internet security and actually our national security” in the era since the September 11 terrorist attacks by “elevating offensive operations” over cyber-defence.“When you are the one country in the world that has a vault that is more full than everyone else’s, it doesn’t make any sense to be attacking all day and never defending your vault,” he said. “And it makes even less sense when you let the standards for vaults worldwide have a big back door that anyone can walk in.”The 30-year-old also claimed that by spending so much effort on harvesting communications data en masse, US security agencies were failing to pick up would-be terrorists such as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the brothers alleged to have bombed last year’s Boston Marathon, who had been previously flagged to the US as a cause for concern by Russian authorities. “We are monitoring everyone’s communications rather than suspects’ communications,” he said. “If we hadn’t spent so much on mass surveillance, if we had followed traditional patterns, we might have caught him.”Snowden also pointed to the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called “underwear bomber” who attempted to blow up a plane bound for Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. The US failed to intercept him despite several opportunities, including a warning from his father to US officials in Nigeria.An audience of 3,500 packed into an auditorium in Austin applauded several of Snowden’s answers to questions from a pair of onstage moderators and others submitted through Twitter. Despite a glitchy and intermittent video link that he said was running through seven proxies, Snowden looked relaxed and confident.He said that while the US has “an oversight model that could work” to guard against excess by intelligence agencies, in reality it had proved ineffectual. “The problem is when your overseers are not interested in oversight,” he said, and “champion the NSA instead of holding them to account”.James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, has admitted to not telling the truth when he told a congressional hearing last year that the government was not “collecting data on millions of Americans”. Snowden said Clapper had shown officials “can lie to the country, lie to the Congress, and face not even a criticism”.He claimed that the behaviour of the US in online surveillance policy would only encourage the rest of the world to do the same, endangering the privacy of all citizens. “If we don’t resolve these issues, if we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government will accept that as a green light to continue, and that is not what we want,” he said.Snowden stressed that his message to technology firms such as Facebook and Google was “not that you can’t collect any data” but rather “that you should only collect the data, and hold it as long is necessary, for the operation of your business”.He recently became the victim of a hacking when a scan of his US passport was released online, having been taken from the files of a professional organisation that gives certification to “ethical” hackers. “I submitted those forms back in 2010,” said Snowden. “Why was that still on a web-facing terminal?”He encouraged ordinary internet users to protect themselves against surveillance by encrypting both their hard drives and their online activity, describing encryption as “the defence against the dark arts in the digital realm”. He also advised people to browse the web anonymously using the Tor system.He urged software developers to create more user-friendly secure communications tools that could “pass the Glenn Greenwald test”, referring to Greenwald’s inability to communicate securely using PGP encryption when he first approached the journalist, then working for the Guardian. However, he warned: “If you are a target of the NSA, it is game over no matter what unless you are taking really technical steps to protect yourself.”Despite now being unable to return to the US, where he faces a criminal indictment, a defiant Snowden said he did not regret his decision to orchestrate the biggest leak in the history of US intelligence. “Would I do this again? The answer is absolutely yes,” he said. “Regardless of what happens to me, this is something we had a right to know.”By the end end of his interview, the audience was on its feet to deliver a standing ovation. Snowden smiled and looked slightly embarrassed, before being abruptly cut off by the end of the video call, when the screen fell blank."	Science

Edward Snowden has a piece of advice for you, the average American Internet user: Employ whatever encryption tools you have at your disposal to make the National Security Agency's job a little bit harder.[ 15 Ways to Make Sense of Calls for NSA Reform ][ A Look at the Fallout From the 2013 Snowden Leaks ]Snowden doesn't often speak to the public, given his status as an American refugee in Russia, but he appeared at South By Southwest Monday via Google Hangouts--and seven proxies--to encourage the people who create devices and software to make user security a priority.""There's a policy response that needs to occur but there's also a technical response that needs to occur,"" Snowden said. ""It's the makers, thinkers, and the development community that can help make sure we're safe.""The NSA's surveillance powers seem so far-reaching that fighting against them may well be an exercise in futility. Spies can track your phone calls, read your text messages, view your bank transactions and your e-mails, see your Web-browsing history, collect screenshots of your Yahoo webcam chats, and even eavesdrop on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone calls. The list goes on and on. And on and on.If you're an NSA target, there is very little you can do to keep the agency out of your computer. But the majority of the data that spy agencies are collecting is completely innocuous, and there's no rhyme or reason as to why the intelligence community needs to collect or store that information. So how do regular folks avoid getting caught in the net? Encryption is the key, Snowden said.Tools you can useFull-disk encryption and network encryption, like SSL, are good places to start, but there are also tools like no-tracking browser plug-ins and Tor's anonymity software. Documents leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has attempted to breach Tor but has largely been unable to de-anonymize the network's users.""We need to think about encryption not as this arcane black art but as a basic protection, the defense against the black arts in the digital realm,"" Snowden said.There are more advanced encryption tools available, but they're built by geeks for geeks. The average consumer tends to use software that's familiar or comes preinstalled on the devices they buy.""Most people aren't going to go out and download an obscure encryption [tool],"" said Chris Soghoian, the American Civil Liberties Union's principal technologist, who spoke with Snowden at SXSW. ""They're going to use the tools they already have: Facebook, Google, Skype. When Google turned on [SSL for Gmail], they made passive surveillance of users' communications more difficult for agencies. We need services to be building security in. That doesn't mean that small developers can't play a role. What I want is for the next WhatsApp or Twitter to use encrypted end-to-end communications.""Snowden and Soghoian agreed that companies like Google and Facebook prioritize data collection for ad-selling purposes over data protection for users. End-to-end encryption gets in the way of what those companies can see and use for their own purposes.""The irony that we're using Google Hangouts to talk to Ed Snowden is not lost on me, or on anyone here,"" Soghoian said.A serious shift for SXSWSome officials weren't happy that Snowden appeared at SXSW in any form. Congressman Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, urged festival organizers to rescind Snowden's invitation and claimed that Snowden's leaks have put U.S. intelligence efforts at risk. Obviously organizers disagreed.""I appreciate his interest in SXSW, but I've never uninvited a speaker, and so we wouldn't do this with Snowden,"" SXSW Interactive director Hugh Forrest told Forbes. ""Our goal here is to be an open platform. I'd love to have the NSA giving a lecture. I hope it goes off flawlessly because I think it's the biggest thing we've ever done, in terms of political and cultural relevance. It's a big deal.""Snowden's appearance at South By Southwest, in addition to festival interviews with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and security journalist Glenn Greenwald, signal a more serious future for the festival that moves beyond app announcements and the social scene.After coming forward to claim credit for the NSA leaks, Snowden confessed his biggest concern was that people wouldn't care. Clearly that's not the case.""When I came out with this, it wasn't so I could single-handedly change the government,"" Snowden said. ""I took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and I saw that Constitution being violated on a massive scale.""Privacy, big data, and online surveillance have become a few of the most pressing issues of our time. If SXSW had ignored those topics in favor of flavor-of-the-month apps, it would have lost all relevance.Caitlin McGarry is Macworld's Staff Writer.

World of tech
 

In a rare live interview, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden echoed an encryption call to arms.Channeled in to Austin's SXSW via Google Hangouts, Snowden said encryption should be easily accessible to the everyday person, not just technologists, to ensure protection from government spying.
He said that the view of encryption as an ""arcane dark art"" needs to change, and that technology companies should have encryption built into their services as a way to protect the people who use them.""Encryption does work,"" Snowden declared, noting that while services like Tor are effective, they aren't typically used by most people.Positioned in front of a green screen showing Article One of the US Constitution, Snowden also called for ""a watchdog that watches Congress,"" one that could call out when officials lie to the public, as the former government contractor alleges has happened repeatedly.Interestingly, Snowden said companies like Google and Facebook can continue to make ad revenue with data they collect from user emails and messages while still protecting users from government eyes.""[They can] get advertising money but can give people the security they want,"" he said, noting it's a matter of doing it responsibly.Snowden said earlier in the session that the NSA is ""setting fire to the future of the internet,"" and that it's up to the technology community to put out the flames before it's too late.Asked if blowing the lid off bulk data collection and other spying programs was worth the consequences he now faces, Snowden had his to say:""Would I do this again? The answer is absolutely yes. I took an oath to defend and support the Constitution, and I felt the Constitution was violated on a massive scale.""You can watch Snowden's interview at SXSW below:Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

AUSTIN — Former security contractor Edward Snowden, addressing a sympathetic crowd on Monday at a tech-heavy event in Texas from a secret location in Russia, said proposed reforms at the National Security Agency show that he was vindicated in leaking classified material.  Snowden, who faces arrest if he steps foot on American soil, spoke via a video link to a packed house at the annual South by Southwest gathering of tech industry experts, filmmakers and musicians. He said the government still has no idea what material he has provided to journalists.  “I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,” Snowden said to applause, adding that his revelations of government spying on private communications have resulted in protections that have benefited the public and global society.  NSA officials declined to comment on the Snowden remarks.  Last year, Snowden, who had been working at an NSA facility as an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, leaked a raft of secret documents that revealed a vast government system for monitoring phone and Internet data.  The leaks deeply embarrassed the Obama administration, which in January banned eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly countries and allies and began reining in the collection of Americans' phone data in a series of limited reforms triggered by Snowden's revelations.  Major companies tightened  safeguards. But Snowden said the efforts are still not enough to protect privacy properly, calling for stepped-up encryption that would make widespread government surveillance too costly.   “The government has gone and changed their talking points. They have changed their verbiage away from public interest to national interest,” he said, adding that this poses the risk of losing control of representative democracy.   U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, wrote to SXSW organizers, calling on them to withdraw the invitation to Snowden, who he said deceived his employer and his country.  “Rewarding Mr. Snowden's behavior in this way encourages the very lawlessness he exhibited,” Pompeo wrote.  To many in government and at the NSA, Snowden is a traitor who compromised the security of the United States. But for many at the conference, he is a hero who protected privacy and civil liberties.  “To me, Snowden is a patriot who believed that what he did was in the best interests of his country,” said Roeland Stekelenburg, creative director at the Dutch Internet firm Infostrada.  Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he has asylum. The White House wants him returned to the United States for prosecution.

	Leftists and libertarians who join them in their “national security state” rhetoric love Edward Snowden for leaking thousands of classified documents to leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald and to The Washington Post, exposing and compromising U.S. surveillance programs. 

	On Monday night, the public radio show “The World” – distributed to NPR stations across America by Minneapolis-based Public Radio International – oozed online that Snowden was “bigger than a rock star” in his appearance at an ACLU event at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas. That same line was announced by anchorman Marco Werman:
WERMAN: The biggest event at the South by Southwest Conference didn’t involve a band, but it did involve a rock star. All right, a rock star of the digital world, anyway. South by Southwest is not just a music festival. It’s an interactive venue to discuss the latest in tech. And that’s why former NSA contractor Edward Snowden made an appearance today via a videolink from Russia. He spoke on a panel about privacy moderated by the American Civil Liberties Union. Behind him on the screen: an image of the U.S. Constitution.
	Werman asked producer Stephen Davy how it came across:
	DAVY: I have to say, Snowden is taking over – he took over all of Austin this morning.

	WERMAN: What about the people in the room? Did they view him more as a criminal, or as a rock star?

	DAVY: I have to say, Marco, definitely a rock star.
	Online, producer Bradley Campbell elaborated on the lovefest:
	The crowd was Snowden's type of people — the hackers, the people working on net neutrality and advocacy — according to Davy. A couple of times, the crowd interrupted him with applause during the session. Snowden even ended the panel like a rocker finishing a set: “Thank you! Thank you Austin!” he said.

	Davy says it’s hard to know if there were any dissenters in the crowd. The ACLU lobbed him softball questions, Davy notes, and the ones coming from Twitter didn’t seem to challenge what he did, either.
For example, no one challenged him when he said the NSA missed its chance to prevent the Boston bombings, due to its preoccupation with collecting meta-data.

	Snowden sparked some strong reactions when he was asked about the future of the Internet. He says the NSA is setting fire to it — arguing that massive data collection will turn the Internet into a controlled universe where the giant tech companies collude with the NSA in all matters.

	Davy says the crowd listened attentively to his cautionary words. It is, after all, a group of people who care deeply about the Internet and its future.
	Nowhere in this segment, either on air or online, acknowledged that Snowden and his biggest fans are radical leftists. Instead, they are just described as people who ""care deeply about the Internet and its future."" As opposed to people who ""care deeply about America and its future.""
	No one seemed to discuss how it was that this ""rock star"" for global freedom was sitting in judgment of America from Russia as it invades sovereign nations.Please support NewsBusters today!

931	Above: Editor of The Intercept Glenn Greenwald (virtually) addressed a crowd of attendees at SXSW 2014.AUSTIN, Texas — Glenn Greenwald, editor of the newly launched digital publication The Intercept, told attendees at SXSWi that the National Security Agency is wary of anyone who takes steps to protect their online activity from being hacked, such as using encryption tools.“In [the NSA’s] mind, if you want to hide what you’re saying from them, it must mean that what you’re saying is a bad thing,” Greenwald said via a Skype video call. “They view the use of encryption… as evidence that you’re suspicious and can actually target you if you use it.”Greenwald is one of three journalists who activist Edward Snowden entrusted with access to his entire trove of classified documents about the NSA’s surveillance program. During the past year, Greenwald has been dissecting this massive pile of information, adding context and piecing together reports on the NSA’s more questionable surveillance activities. The results have been published in a string of bombshell articles by Greenwald, first in the Guardian and now in The Intercept. Given his access to these documents, Greenwald has a deeper understanding than most of how the NSA operates.Greenwald’s extensive knowledge of the NSA makes what he’s saying all the more concerning.During the panel, Greenwald said the NSA is able to target encrypted communications because so few people actually use encryption tools. That makes the people who are actually trying to stay secure stick out like sore thumbs, thus making it much easier for the agency to focus its efforts on hacking the relatively small bits of encrypted data that they intercept.“I do think individuals have the principal obligation to protect their data,” Greenwald said, likening that responsibility to that of lawyers who protect their clients or journalists who protect their sources. But, he said, the biggest reason to begin using encryption is to make it far more difficult for the government to gain access to your data without going through the proper channels — such as legal warrants, wiretap orders, or subpoenas.And it’s not just the NSA that Greenwald blames for the overly invasive surveillance.“The national security state in Washington has so completely perfected the art of co-opting and capturing whatever safeguards are created, that they’re very adept at turning them into further tools for their own power rather than what they’re intended to be,” he said.The best example of this co-opting, Greenwald said, is with the heads of congressional intelligence committees. “Very quickly, the people in those [intelligence agency] communities figured out how to install slavish loyalists as the heads of those committees so that those committees failed at their designed function to exercise oversight. …“So you have the heads of these committees in the House and Senate — Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) — that are the leading apologists for the NSA and who wake up every day to think about ways to trick Americans into believing that there’s going to be a reform, when in reality it’s just going to be designed to strengthen the NSA,” Greenwald said.One cause for concern is that the crowd who turned up to hear Greenwald at SXSW was a mere fraction of the size of the crowd that had gathered just hours before to hear Snowden himself address the public (also via Skype) for the first time since being exiled from the U.S. In other words, lots of people want to hear about government surveillance; not so many are interested in hearing about how to stop it or slow it down.Obviously, the topic of encrypting ones’ data isn’t nearly as important as it should be. Greenwald said earlier in his discussion that this probably has something to do with the perception that using encryption tools are difficult.“The barrier most people have when it comes to encryption is more psychological than anything else,” he said.Recalling a conversation with Snowden about installing encryption tools to communicate, Greenwald said initially he blew Snowden’s suggestion off because he didn’t see the value in it.“I read the things he was saying and my reaction was, ‘Wow, this is incredibly complex. This is like some difficult outer planet bird language that will take me weeks to master,'” he said.“And once I actually did it I realized how incredibly easy it is.”But even though Greenwald doesn’t think U.S. citizens can count on elected officials to help streamline the need for encryption, that doesn’t mean nothing can be done to boost adoption.“There are definitely strides that the tech community needs to make those tools even more user friendly,” Greenwald said.

932	AUSTIN, Tex. — Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden warned that the NSA’s overreaching surveillance program will become the norm all over the world if something isn’t done soon.Snowden. addressed a huge crowd of people in attendance at SXSW 2014 virtually via a Google Hangout video chat today. He has been living in Russia following his decision to leak classified documents about the security agency’s tactics in tracking U.S. citizens, international governments, and companies.In response to a question on whether the U.S. government’s actions will encourage similar behavior from other countries, Snowden said that he believes it will and that this “is one of the primary dangers of not directly resolving the NSA’s actions.”Snowden added:“It’s important to remember that Americans benefit profoundly, [from keeping the NSA and others in check] because we’ve got the most to lose from being hacked, At the same time, every citizen in every country has something to lose. We all are at risk of being unfairly, unjustly, and unwarranted interference in our private lives. Throughout history we see government repeat this trend and at some point they cross the line. If we don’t resolve these issues, if we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government in the international community will accept that as a sort of green light to do the same.”Snowden was also concerned that efforts made by the NSA to circumvent the security on many consumer technologies might have given people the impression that there is no line of defense when it comes to protecting their data.“Bottom line is that encryption does work. We need to think of encryption not as a sort of arcane black art, but as sort of the basic protections against the dark arts,” he said.“This is something we all need to not only be implementing but also actively searching for ways to improve encryption.”Today’s virtual conversation with Snowden was led by the American Civil Liberties Union’s Christopher Soghoian, who outlined that making encryption more difficult to crack would lead to fewer instances of NSA-style tracking, but not simply because it would prove impenetrable.During the panel, Soghoian explained that a result of better encryption technologies could mean that it takes far more resources to crack. If that happens, he theorizes, governments will be far more selective about what it deems worthy of cracking.What’s interesting about this viewpoint is that it’s an economic solution to the problem — albeit one that doesn’t actually prevent the NSA from violating U.S. citizens’ right to privacy.

934	"Glenn Greenwald, the Constitutional attorney who became a blogger and then reporter – and Ed Snowden’s go-to journalist to publish his cache of National Security Agency documents – Skyped to SXSW Interactive this afternoon, talking the nature of politics and the necessity of public journalism.Greenwald was interviewed from Austin by Micah Sifry, the editorial director of Personal Democracy MediaWhen whistleblower Snowden needed to contact someone trustworthy to accept and eventually publish the leaked NSA documents Snowden had acquired through his work at security firm Booz Allen Hamilton, he chose Greenwald because of his record of defending whistleblowers as well as his harsh criticism of mass surveillance by the U.S. and other governments. Greenwald became both a reporter and a publisher of the Snowden documents, collaborating with other reporters and publications (The Guardian, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and others). Greenwald has helped reveal the gross overreaching of the NSA, and both the range and the ineffectiveness of its mass surveillance, providing indispensable critical reporting on the agency’s violation of the U.S. Constitution, its spying on other governments, and its dishonesty about the extent of that surveillance.In his conversation with Sifry, Greenwald laughed at being used as an example by Snowden (earlier in the day) of “journalistic incompetence” at understanding the technical side of privacy issues. (Snowden had said privacy methods must pass “the Greenwald Test” of being easy to use.) But he added that he had initially resisted all the security practices Snowden had recommended, considering them too time-consuming and difficult. While there is a learning curve, Greenwald said, in fact he eventually realized that encryption procedures and the like are “really quite easy” to learn and employ. Moreover, Greenwald recommended that more and more people make use of encryption, saying that initially the security agencies see the use of encryption as itself a marker of potential sinister actions – but that if more people come to use encryption, it will make it difficult or impossible to continue mass surveillance, and the agencies will have to focus on actual suspects as opposed to everybody using the Internet. “People who use encryption software are treated as suspicious,” Greenwald said, “so many more people need to use it to normalize it.”Greenwald noted that political and prosecutorial attacks on whistleblowers and journalists are designed to create a climate of fear, to deter others from acting likewise. He noted that in Snowden’s case in particular, it is useful to those in power for Snowden to be trapped in Russia -- the U.S. revoked his passport -- so that it’s easier to accuse him of betraying the U.S. or being in league with a foreign power. Greenwald said the current relationship between political power and privacy is exactly the reverse of what it should be: official secrets are massive, while individual privacy is routinely violated. He noted the ridiculous overreach of “secret” designations -- saying that the Snowden papers are full of public information and utterly innocuous documents that have been classified ""top secret"" -- and said that the default policy should be that official documents, with few exceptions, should be classified, and private information of ordinary citizens, with very few exceptions, should remain private -- as the Constitution determines.Questioned by Sifry about potential political change, Greenwald expressed little optimism that much change on this front will be achieved by conventional Congressional action -- because, he said, the current policies are “bipartisan” and institutional -- but he added that such political fights are important both procedurally and symbolically. Greenwald has recently launched, with funding from eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar, an online publication called The Intercept -- initially devoted to publishing more stories based on the Snowden documents, but steadily growing as a “new model” of alternative journalism. He said that the purpose of journalism is to “shine a light on the information that world leaders want to hide but the public needs to know,” and that his metric of eventual journalistic success is “how much change you’re able to generate.” He said he isn’t really focused on the business side of The Intercept -- except to the extent of maintaining journalistic independence -- and that beyond that, “journalism is part of our larger obligations as citizens.”Greenwald said he and other reporters are “about half-way” through reporting the basic stories emerging out of the Snowden documents, and that it will be “another six or seven months” before all of those stories emerge, including many that “are more important and more complex than have already been revealed.” He said that he is not simply dumping the documents wholesale because (1) he promised Snowden he wouldn’t do that; (2) there are genuinely some matters that need to be redacted as necessarily secret, misleading, or recklessly damaging to individuals; and (3) some of the materials simply need additional reporting to be explained or put in context.Noting the SXSW Interactive occasion, Greenwald noted that all these technological advances, including the Internet itself, are tools that have the potential for good or evil. They can build community and political freedom, he said, or they can be used by governments for mass surveillance that “perverts and threatens” their purposes. But he also noted that it’s not helpful to be constantly in fear or paranoid about surveillance and its consequences; journalists in particular, he said, “need to take such risks seriously but not let it interfere with your work.”Asked to sum up the day’s conversations, he called the Snowden story particularly inspiring, because it reflected how one person, otherwise without access to the levers of power, could be a force for change. When we’re confronting government or corporate power, Greenwald concluded, “We all need to avoid defeatist thinking, and take decisive and bold action in defense of our values.”Keep up with all our dispatches from SXSW at austinchronicle.com/sxsw.

935	"BUSINESS SPECTATORFormer security contractor Edward Snowden, addressing a sympathetic crowd at a tech-heavy event in Austin, Texas, on Monday from a secret location in Russia, said proposed reforms at the National Security Agency (NSA) show that he was vindicated in leaking classified material.Snowden, who faces arrest if he steps foot on US soil, spoke via a video link to a packed house at the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) gathering of tech industry experts, filmmakers and musicians. He said the US government still has no idea what material he has provided to journalists.""I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,"" Snowden said to applause, adding that his revelations of government spying on private communications have resulted in protections that have benefited the public and global society.NSA officials declined to comment on the Snowden remarks.Last year, Snowden, who had been working at a NSA facility as an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, leaked a raft of secret documents that revealed a vast US government system for monitoring phone and Internet data.The leaks deeply embarrassed the Obama administration, which in January banned US eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly countries and allies and began reining in the sweeping collection of Americans' phone data in a series of limited reforms triggered by Snowden's revelations.Major companies also tightened up safeguards. But Snowden said the efforts are still not enough to protect privacy properly, calling for stepped-up encryption that would make mass government surveillance too costly to conduct.""The government has gone and changed their talking points. They have changed their verbiage away from public interest to national interest,"" he said, adding that this poses the risk of losing control of representative democracy.He said the government's priority has been an expansive and ill-executed system of massive information collection instead of protecting the vast amounts of intellectual property that support the US economy.""We've got the most to lose from being hacked,"" Snowden said.US Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, wrote to SXSW organizers, calling on them to withdraw the invitation to Snowden, who he said deceived his employer and his country.""Rewarding Mr Snowden's behaviour in this way encourages the very lawlessness he exhibited,"" Pompeo wrote.To many in government and at the NSA, Snowden is a traitor who compromised the security of the United States. But for many at the conference he is a hero who protected privacy and civil liberties.""To me, Snowden is a patriot who believed that what he did was in the best interests of his country,"" said Roeland Stekelenburg, creative director at the Dutch Internet firm Infostrada.Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he currently has asylum. The White House wants him returned to the United States for prosecution.The forum will focus on beyond China – Australia’s food opportunity in Southeast Asia, the rise of the home delivery business and Amazon Fresh, animal welfare and the growing importance of social licence to operate in agriculture and the science of food and GMO versus organic food.Tuesday March 27, 2018The Westin Sydney

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke on Saturday and journalist Glenn Greenwald was featured in a session Monday afternoon. All three were virtual, done by videoconference in front of a live audience.Privacy and security have become a major theme of this year’s Interactive festival with Snowden, Assange and Greenwald as speakers, but some weren’t pleased with these choices. A Kansas congressman, Mike Pompeo, sent an open letter to the festival asking that SXSW uninvite Snowden as a speaker.The festival did not agree and has said it has a long-standing policy of creating a “big tent” for diverse points of view, even on controversial topics.Snowden, who wore glasses, a blue shirt and a dark suit jacket and spoke via Google Hangout, centered his presentation, “A Virtual Conversation with Edward Snowden,” on the privacy crisis he said is in danger of spreading to many other countries.Questions for the presentation were submitted via Twitter in addition to questions and comments from co-presenters Ben Wizner and Christopher Soghoian of the American Civil Liberties Union.The ACLU was instrumental in getting Snowden to agree to the session. He has been in exile in Russia, and his videoconference chat was bounced through seven “proxy” locations. The irony of using Google’s product was not lost on the speakers; Google has been at the forefront of the debate about how much data is collected from customers and how much of that data is accessible by the government.Snowden said that such standards and tools must pass the “Glenn Greenwald test,” referring to the former Guardian reporter who broke the NSA story and also spoke on Monday. Snowden believes any journalist should be able to find tools that allow for completely secure communication without government snooping.Unlike Julian Assange’s presentation on Saturday, which drew similar attention and was largely a recap of the potential dangers ahead, Snowden’s was full of actionable suggestions.He said that people can make their communication more secure by using whole-disk encryption, using network encryption, using Web browser plug-ins to make connections more secure and using Tor, a tool for preserving online anonymity.“Encryption works,” Snowden said. “It’s not an arcane black art.” At the very least, the panelists suggested, using encryption makes mass surveillance too expensive to be practical for the NSA.Unfortunately, Soghoian suggested, most Internet users are going to opt for the cheapest service and whatever default apps and tools are made available on their phones. He asked if people would be willing to pay $5 more to have encrypted tools on their devices by default.Snowden expressed no remorse about his current situation or his decision to leak documents.“Regardless of what happens to me, this is something we have to work through,” he said. “I took an oath” to uphold the Constitution and felt compelled to report its violation. The audience applauded his remarks near the end of the presentation.“If we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other country … will accept it as a green light to do the same,” Snowden said. Snowden also urged more oversight of the NSA and suggested a watchdog group to monitor Congress.Later Monday afternoon, Greenwald, who will soon release a book about the Snowden affair, decried the government’s inclination to make documents, even banal ones, classified by default while personal privacy has been cracked wide open.“Almost everything we do is now under a microscope and transparent,” Greenwald said.SXSW Interactive continues Tuesday with keynote speaker Chelsea Clinton and other sessions featuring FEED’s Lauren Bush Lauren, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and comics Adam Carolla and Fred Armisen. The SXSW Interactive Awards and a closing party at Stubb’s will be held in the evening.                                                © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Encryption technologies can be a powerful tool against government surveillance, but the most effective techniques are still largely out of reach to the average Internet user, Edward Snowden said Monday.
""Encryption does work,"" Snowden said, speaking via satellite video from Russia at the South by Southwest Interactive technology festival in Austin, Texas. ""We need to think of encryption not as an arcane black art, but as a basic protection in the digital realm,"" the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor said.Snowden chose to speak at SXSW rather than before a legislative or policy group because it's the technology community that can really fix security and digital rights, he said. ""This is something we should not only implement, but actively research and improve on an academic level,"" he said.[ Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need. | Get the latest from CSO by signing up for our newsletters. ]But now, the best encryption, like end-to-end encryption, often does not find its way into mainstream product and is not always employed by major Internet companies that depend on advertising.Ideally, more companies would make strong encryption a default part of their services, without requiring action from the consumer, or burying the option several menus deep. It may be difficult, however, for companies like Google and Facebook to adopt the strongest encryption protocols like end-to-end encryption, Snowden said during a discussion about security with two representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union. Those companies gather lots of data about their users and use it for advertising. It's harder to gather that data when the endpoints are encrypted, the speakers said.Since the disclosures began last June from documents leaked to reporters by Snowden, ""companies have improved their security,"" said Chris Soghoian, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. There is security, for instance, between user's computers and Google's servers, he said.But it's difficult for major Internet companies providing a free service to offer end-to-end encryption because it conflicts with their business model, he said. And. unfortunately, the tools that offer secure, end-to-end online communications are not polished or easy to use, speakers said. ""The tools designed with security as a first goal are often developed by independent developers, activists and hobbyists,"" he said.After previously classified documents were leaked by Snowden, a number of large technology companies, including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo announced new protocols for encrypting users' data. But the problem is that one of the most commonly used encryption technologies, known as TLS (Transport Layer Security) is not all that strong against the intelligence gathering community, Snowden said.TSL encryption, which is used by services owned by Google and Skype, encrypts communications at the point of transport and then the companies de-crypt and re-encrypt it, Snowden said. End-to-end encryption, on the other hand, forces intelligence-gathering groups to target individual computers, which are much harder to crack.""I think that's the way to do it,"" Snowden said, speaking on the value of end-to-end encryption.Some of the most advanced encryption technologies are difficult to use and they're not always free. Still, Snowden identified several steps Internet users can take to protect their data from surveillance. There's disk encryption, which protects data stored on hardware; there are browser security plug-ins like NoScript; and apps like Ghostery for Web cookie tracking, Snowden said. He also recommended Tor, which is designed to conceal online activity by routing Internet traffic through a networked relay system.If people take those steps to encrypt their hardware and network communications, their online data would be better protected from massive government surveillance. But targeted surveillance is still harder to evade.Snowden did not say that companies like Google and Facebook should not collect any data about their users. Rather, companies should not store data for long periods of time.""You can do these things in a responsible way where people can still get value of the services ... without putting users at risk,"" he said.The appropriate length of time that companies should retain user data was not, however, addressed during the talk.Zach Miners covers social networking, search and general technology news for IDG News Service.

	Whistleblower Edward Snowden addressed the SXSW audience in a rare public Interview today and gave some policy suggestions about how the government can better protect our 4th Amendment rights. The good news is that congress is already considering many of the proposals he mentioned.First and foremost, Snowden says intelligence agencies need to adopt a “law enforcement” model of defense. In other words, they need to cease the bulk collection of Internet and phone data and, instead, only go after suspects with a warrant. A contingent of congress members, including U.S. Senators Rand Paul and Ron Wyden, have proposed exactly that.However, Snowden saw a bigger problem with congress, who he accused of “cheerleading for the NSA instead of holding them accountable.” For instance, when Director of the NSA, James Clapper, admittedly gave false answers to Congress about the bulk collection of data, some members of the Intelligence Committee rushed to his defense.“We need a watchdog that watches congress,” he said.The closest thing being proposed by both congress and President Barack Obama is a so-called “public advocate”. The proposed role would litigate against the NSA when agents go to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to ask for permission to spy on Americans.The important issue, especially to the tech industry, is the ability to disclose the number of users affected by NSA spying. Hopefully, then, we can know whether the government is, indeed, spying on us all or if it’s been more selective in its investigations. Google’s most recent Transparency Report was able to disclose a bit more data from which organization was requesting information on its users, but we still don’t know all the ways in which intelligence agencies are collecting data.Concludes Snowden, “If we’re not informed, we can’t consent to these policies”.[Image Credit: Flickr Users yeahbouyee!]Latest headlines delivered to you daily"	Science
944	Canadians will soon need to pay more to watch series and movies on Netflix. The company has raised the price of its plans for both new and existing users. While the rise has been already implemented for new subscribers, existing users will be notified through email before new rates are charged from them.In a statement released by Netflix, the company cited addition of new content and introduction of new features and services as the reasons behind the price rise. It said that Netflix adjusts the pricing of its packages from time to time as they introduce new movies, exclusive TV series and upgrade their platform to offer better services to its customers.The company has a huge database of content and also produces its own original content which has become popular like House of Cards. It also has a large number of movies sourced exclusively from international film festivals. Few of USA TV shows are also aired by Netflix in Canada like CW’s Riverdale and ABC’s Scandal.Netflix has a growing market in Canada and in 2016 it had around 5.2 million subscriptions. The television streaming market is quite competitive in Canada and many leading names are fighting out with each other.Brands like Amazon prime are quite a hit in the country having Canadian airing rights of highly rated shows such as American Gods and Mr. Robot. CBS All Access is also set to enter the Canadian market sometime in 2018 with its 9,000 episodes from various shows. The multiple numbers of competitors and the fight to acquire rights for shows has increased the acquisition cost of the content. Though Netflix did not mention it in their statement, still it is a situation faced by all companies in Canadian television industry.Netflix increased their prices last year in May while introducing the feature of streaming in high quality on multiple devices. This time the increase has been $1 for the basic plan making it $8.99 per month. Users can only stream standard quality videos on a single device at a time. The cost of the standard plan has also gone up by $1 ($10.99 per month) which permits subscribers to access content on two screens. Subscribers of the premium plan now have to shell out a monthly $13.99, which is a $2 increase from the previous price. Users can view high definition 4k videos simultaneously on four screens with this plan.The company changes its prices based on local market conditions in a country. The Australian subscribers had to pay few dollars more after Netflix raised the prices in June countering the increase in local taxes. It remains to be seen how the users will respond to the move.TV streaming service in Canada will get a major boost next year with the introduction of CBS Corp’s CBS All Access service. It is the company’s bid to go international that prompted the move and gave Canada the first opportunity to enjoy its content.The online streaming service in the US has a huge database of content and around 9,000 episodes from its various series. Viewers will also get access to special CBS channels like Showtime without requiring a cable connection. Apart from television activities, those who fond of games playing can try out one of the secure Canadian source NBSO online casino games list website. It is free and has a high level of reliability (si vous parlez français, essayez de choisir des jeux sur le site web du guide spécial casino en ligne, qui est fiable et gratuit).CBS corp. has a good chance of creating a considerable grab on the market but it lacks on one ground. The copyrights of many of its shows are already purchased by Canadian broadcasters like Rogers Communications Inc., BCE Inc. and Corus Entertainment Inc. So viewers will not get to see shows like Survivor or The Big Bang Theory and some of the shows are also aired on Netflix. The restricted content may impact the number of subscribers the company is expecting.We have to wait and see as CBS predicts they are going to have 4 million subscriptions by the end of this year. It is interesting to note that TV viewership is declining in Canada and online streaming services are giving a tough competition to the traditional form. In 2016, the volume of subscribers reduced by 1% and reached 11.1 billion viewers and the revenue fell by 2% amounting to $8.7 billion, according to the data from Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.On the other hand, online streaming services have gained increased number of subscriptions. Netflix recorded a growth of 52 million viewers in US alone and another 52 million from all over the world. Compared to that, 158,000 people in Canada disconnected their cable service in 2015. It can be expected that the market is ripe for online streaming in Canada and other players like Hulu and HBO Go may join the competition in some years.With so many providers in the game, the price is also a big factor in getting subscriptions. CBS did not reveal the rates they will charge in Canada, but in the US current rates are $5.99 per month. To get a commercial free version, viewers have to pay $9.99. If the rates are any higher, then Canadian may not be too interested in joining up considering the limitation of content.Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS said that they were aware of the potential of online streaming judging the success of their competitors. The introduction of the service in Canada gives them the chance to directly reach the viewer on an increased scale which can be expanded globally. CBS All Access had achieved a growing domestic market and now is ready with their premium content to hit the international arena.Auto insurance provider Intact Insurance in Nova Scotia plan to use mobile apps to track driver habits to determine the premium rates in the future. Based on the way one drives, they can be eligible for a 25% savings on their insurance premium!The idea may sound out of a science fiction movie but the concept has existed for some time. Many companies like Intact Insurance offer a plug in dongles for vehicles which are used to track driver habits. Intact insurance revealed that the dongle program included 350,000 participants from all over the country. It was introduced at N.S in 2014.However, they are not always the practical solution due to various reasons.First is the cost that prohibits their universal use and in some cases, the devices are not returned to the company. They can also be lost adding to the cost of the company. Another reason is the dongles track the habits of any driver that gets behind the wheel and it is not possible to distinguish between them.Mobile apps have many unique advantages that make them a pragmatic solution for the insurance companies. The app would be using the smart phone of the driver and eliminate any expense on part of the insurance provider. They will also be able to specifically track the habits of the insurance payer which is their priority. It will only monitor the main driver as the app will be linked to his mobile phone.The tool will be used to track aspects of sudden accelerations, hard braking, night driving utilizing the GPS feature of the phones. Intact Insurance applied for permission to launch the program from the N.S Utility and Review Board which was granted on August 4. The company plans to launch the service next month starting September. The initiative will be a way to reward drivers with good habits and give them lower insurance rates for their performance.For the time being, the app or the dongle insurance rates are optional in Canada. But according to experts, a day may come when it automatically becomes more preferable considering the costs. With the advance of technology, the companies may increase the cost of the premium and people will opt for the tracking program for affordability.But not all customers may be willing to join the program. It has been seen that many consumers do not prefer to join such programs. Some also practice bad driving habits like speeding or other dangerous stunts which may impact the insurance rates. There are also some apprehensions about the nature of data collected by the app and its usage by the company. But as the insurance industry is regulated it has not misused the user data under its control.	Science

947	MyBroadband – Trusted in TechFormer security contractor Edward Snowden, addressing a sympathetic crowd at a tech-heavy event in Austin, Texas, on Monday from a secret location in Russia, said proposed reforms at the National Security Agency show that he was vindicated in leaking classified material.Snowden, who faces arrest if he steps foot on U.S. soil, spoke via a video link to a packed house at the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) gathering of tech industry experts, filmmakers and musicians. He said the U.S. government still has no idea what material he has provided to journalists.“I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,” Snowden said to applause, adding that his revelations of government spying on private communications have resulted in protections that have benefited the public and global society.NSA officials declined to comment on the Snowden remarks.Last year, Snowden, who had been working at a NSA facility as an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, leaked a raft of secret documents that revealed a vast U.S. government system for monitoring phone and Internet data.The leaks deeply embarrassed the Obama administration, which in January banned U.S. eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly countries and allies and began reining in the sweeping collection of Americans’ phone data in a series of limited reforms triggered by Snowden’s revelations.Major companies also tightened up safeguards. But Snowden said the efforts are still not enough to protect privacy properly, calling for stepped-up encryption that would make mass government surveillance too costly to conduct.“The government has gone and changed their talking points. They have changed their verbiage away from public interest to national interest,” he said, adding that this poses the risk of losing control of representative democracy.He said the government’s priority has been an expansive and ill-executed system of massive information collection instead of protecting the vast amounts of intellectual property that support the U.S. economy.“We’ve got the most to lose from being hacked,” Snowden said.U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, wrote to SXSW organizers, calling on them to withdraw the invitation to Snowden, who he said deceived his employer and his country.“Rewarding Mr. Snowden’s behavior in this way encourages the very lawlessness he exhibited,” Pompeo wrote.To many in government and at the NSA, Snowden is a traitor who compromised the security of the United States. But for many at the conference he is a hero who protected privacy and civil liberties.“To me, Snowden is a patriot who believed that what he did was in the best interests of his country,” said Roeland Stekelenburg, creative director at the Dutch Internet firm Infostrada.Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he currently has asylum.

951	Reuters Staff4 Min Read(Adds NSA declining to comment) By Jon Herskovitz AUSTIN, Texas, March 10 (Reuters) - Former security contractor Edward Snowden, addressing a sympathetic crowd at a tech-heavy event in Austin, Texas, on Monday from a secret location in Russia, said proposed reforms at the National Security Agency show that he was vindicated in leaking classified material. Snowden, who faces arrest if he steps foot on U.S. soil, spoke via a video link to a packed house at the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) gathering of tech industry experts, filmmakers and musicians.

Source: Empire BurlesqueTry to recall those dark days -- now long since banished, thank God! -- when the American imperium thrust its grubby hands and greedy eyes into every single digital pie available, scarfing up emails, URLs, locations, even webcam shots, of anybody and everybody, then storing them all in gargantuan data silos, to sift through and fondle for years on end. Remember that? Remember how this surveillance state, this  über-Stasi, was put to the service of a regime that was actually going all over the world and murdering people -- without charges, without due process, without defense, without warning. Just circling the world, blowing up a wedding party here, a couple of teenagers there, a village, a funeral, a farm, an apartment block, day after day, week after week, year after year? Innocent people, ""guilty"" people; guilty of something  or other, that is -- maybe just behaving in a ""suspicious manner"" in the eyes of unaccountable officials acting arbitrarily in secret, on the basis of screenshots sent by back by robots, and rumors and vendettas gathered, for pay, by secret agents.  - Advertisement - 


				(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:9617682719021414,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-4182-648""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs"");
				

Do you remember how this brutal, barbaric, ugly, inhuman regime would then go around the world condemning other nations for not being moral, holy, freedom-loving and strictly adherent to international law? Do you remember the base, sickening hypocrisy of it all? State murderers -- proud  state murderers, murderers who would go before legislators and under oath to God Almighty swear how proud they were to be murdering people -- telling other nations how to order their affairs according to the principles of law and justice and human rights? 
Isn't it wonderful how much has changed since those days, when we discovered the spine and musculature of the surveillance regime that undergirded this ghastly system of murder and corruption and domination?What? What do you mean nothing's changed? What do you mean that this barbaric system is still firing on all cylinders? What do you mean that the surveillance state has not been crippled or even slowed for a single instant by all these world-changing revelations? What are you saying? That those who facilitated the exposure of the NSA documents, like Greenwald, are now working for techno-oligarchs who fund rapacious, elite-enriching, regime-changing ""philanthropic"" enterprises all over the world? Whose companies actually helped strangulate Wikileaks in its greatest hour of need by cutting off its venues of funding?Are you trying to tell me that even Snowden himself -- who risked so much to bring these crimes to light -- now declares forthrightly ""that spying serves a vital purpose and must continue""? That he has taken great pains to declare that his incendiary material should only be ""safely disclosed to responsible journalists in coordination with government stakeholders,"" as Arthur Silber pointedly points out? In coordination with ""government stakeholders?"" The same ""government stakeholders"" who are murdering people around the world and sticking their webcams into our underwear? Is that what you're trying to tell me?What next? Are you going to tell me that even Jeremy Scahill, Greenwald's partner in the oligarch-funded venture, First Look, which is going to transform journalism as we know it for all time to come, has also declared that their transformative operation will dutifully submit its work to government scrutiny -- with the caveat, of course, that they may not follow the government's advice on how ""dangerous"" it might be to publish the dutifully submitted material? (Which is, of course, the same way that every other non-transformed journalistic entity in the Western world operates.)
Is that what you're trying to say? That the murder goes on, the surveillance goes on, the crime goes on, and that even our most cutting-edge, transformative, dangerous and subversive journalists and whistleblowers are committed to acting ""responsibly"" in ""coordination with government stakeholders.""
Well, if I may once again quote the great Mel Brooks quoting the great Joe Schrank: ""I can hardly believe my hearing aid!"" 
Maybe I need new batteries for this thing. Everywhere I hear unstinting -- and unquestioning -- praise for these developments; but nowhere do I see any genuine effect. I mean, yes, of course, it's good to see ""progressive"" hero Rachel Maddow expressing umbrage at the revelations that Barack Obama's Stasi-State is now brazenly spying on their own putative Congressional overseers. Maddow even goes so far as to call this ""End of the Republic stuff."" But is this followed by a call for the impeachment of a president that is ""ending the Republic"" with a security apparat  run amok? Of course not. The main progressive goal, as always, is to express a bit of marginal outrage while devoting one's main energies to ensuring that whatever ""centrist"" suit of clothes the bought-and-sold Democratic establishment puts up as a candidate is elected. (Next up: Hilary ""Annihilate the Iranians"" Clinton in 2016.)
But what of these 2 million documents that Snowden has bequeathed to a few chosen journalists who maintain their iron grip on the revelations, doling them out as they alone see fit -- after, of course, submitting them to the scrutiny of ""government stakeholders""? Let us return to a salient fact that Arthur Silber keeps pointing out: that only 1% to 2% of this vast trove has ever been seen:Well, hold on there a minute, Arthur, you incorrigible skeptic you. What about the latest revelation from The Intercept, the flagship enterprise of First Look? Just last weekend, the Interceptors dug into this vast trove of criminality to inform us that ... the NSA's newsletter has its own Dear Abby column (or ""agony aunt,"" as the Brits would say). Now how about that! The NSA has an internal advice column offering tidbits on personnel issues. Now that's transformative journalism with a vengeance!  Just think how many innocent lives now doomed to die from Washington's surveillance state-supported death squads will now be saved because of this revelation!

953	"We notice you're visiting us from a region where we have a local version of Inc.com.or remain on inc.comSmall app developers and startup computer services businesses listen up: You've got to build better security into your products right away.That was the word from whistleblower Edward Snowden who spoke to an audience at the South by Southwest festival via Google Hangouts from Russia, where his exact location was protected by 8 different proxy servers on Monday. The audio and video quality were atrocious, but the message was compelling.In reference to the National Security Agency's spying program, Snowden said: ""The result has been an adversarial Internet, which is not what we asked for and not what we wanted."" Snowden has been living as fugitive in Russia since 2013, following his exposure of troves of data collected by the NSA. The revelation presented a far bigger picture than had been known of the government's eavesdropping on U.S. citizens and their ordinary interactions, in which many communications and consumer Internet companies have been complicit.Essentially, the services consumer rely on for email, text, and other communications created by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and other consumer Internet companies are not secure because they depend on advertising, noted Snowden. In other words, these larger companies have a business incentive to poke through your emails so they can sell you stuff, Snowden said. That's in addition to the allegation that these firms are collaborating with the NSA. Small companies and startups, however, don’t have to follow that lead. They can develop products and services that are secure out-of-the-box, Snowden and co-panelist Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union, said on stage.One obvious way to secure consumer product would be to offer end-to-end encryption, or other privacy protecting-enhancements for a minimal fee, Soghoian said.""Developers will have to think about security early on, not later down the road,"" Soghoian added.Part of the reason large companies have not secured their products for consumers is that it might make them harder for consumers to use, the panelists said. A natural place for small companies to innovate would be to create products that are easy to use and highly secure.One example given to illustrate that point was Gmail's introduction of secure socket layer email in 2011, which dramatically cut down on hack attacks and snooping on consumers. Apparently that technology had been available for years before Gmail felt the pressure to use it. Now it operates in the background without consumers even knowing it.Another security improvement, Snowden noted, would be if Internet and computing companies that held customer data did so for abbreviated periods of time.""Companies should only hold the data for as long as necessary for the operation at hand,"" Snowden said."

He said the U.S. government still has no idea what material he has provided to journalists.“I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,” Snowden said to applause, adding that his revelations of government spying on private communications have resulted in protections that have benefited the public and global society.NSA officials declined to comment on the Snowden remarks.Last year, Snowden, who had been working at a NSA facility as an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, leaked a raft of secret documents that revealed a vast U.S. government system for monitoring phone and Internet data.The leaks deeply embarrassed the Obama administration, which in January banned U.S. eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly countries and allies and began reining in the sweeping collection of Americans’ phone data in a series of limited reforms triggered by Snowden’s revelations.Major companies also tightened up safeguards. But Snowden said the efforts are still not enough to protect privacy properly, calling for stepped-up encryption that would make mass government surveillance too costly to conduct.“The government has gone and changed their talking points. They have changed their verbiage away from public interest to national interest,” he said, adding that this poses the risk of losing control of representative democracy.He said the government’s priority has been an expansive and ill-executed system of massive information collection instead of protecting the vast amounts of intellectual property that support the U.S. economy.“We’ve got the most to lose from being hacked,” Snowden said.U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, wrote to SXSW organizers, calling on them to withdraw the invitation to Snowden, who he said deceived his employer and his country.“Rewarding Mr. Snowden’s behavior in this way encourages the very lawlessness he exhibited,” Pompeo wrote.To many in government and at the NSA, Snowden is a traitor who compromised the security of the United States. But for many at the conference he is a hero who protected privacy and civil liberties.“To me, Snowden is a patriot who believed that what he did was in the best interests of his country,” said Roeland Stekelenburg, creative director at the Dutch Internet firm Infostrada.Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he currently has asylum. The White House wants him returned to the United States for prosecution._______Copyright © 2014 Capitol Hill BlueCopyright © 2014 Thomson Reuters All Rights Reserved “Rewarding Mr. Snowden’s behavior in this way encourages the very lawlessness he exhibited,” Pompeo wrote.The NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, and other Unitary Executive offices all persecuted, prosecuted, blacklisted, and absolutely ruined the lives of 3 prior whistle-blowers that attempted the legal channels. Snowden had no other avenue to proceed to achieve his goal of defending and protecting the Constitution, something that most of our other officials seem to be have forgotten.Comments are closed.We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.Here is a url for more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies: https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

			Trending:		While repeating his call for government reforms to rein in spy agencies, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden said in a rare public appearance Monday that Silicon Valley and the tech industry must also do more to resist Internet surveillance by expanding encryption and other safeguards for popular online services.“They are setting fire to the future of the Internet,” Snowden said of government spy agencies, while speaking from Russia on a video connection beamed to a mostly tech audience at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. He added: “The people in this room right now — you guys are the firefighters.”Encryption can be a powerful weapon against mass surveillance because it’s extremely difficult to break, Snowden said. He argued that wider use of encryption would force spy agencies to focus on tapping the devices used by individuals whom authorities have reason to target, which he said would be both more effective and more consistent with the U.S. Constitution — a copy of which was prominently displayed behind him as he spoke.Snowden’s appearance comes amid a fierce public debate over government spy programs and whether he was justified in exposing them. Concerns over Internet privacy and surveillance are a hot topic for Silicon Valley — one that’s on the agenda for several sessions at the festival, which is also known as SXSW and which draws thousands of techies and industry leaders each spring.The former contract worker for the National Security Agency fled to Hong Kong and then Russia last year to avoid U.S. prosecution for revealing classified information about government programs. He was joined Monday by two American Civil Liberties Union activists who were on stage in Austin.They were using the popular Google Hangouts video chat service, according to the ACLU’s Ben Wizner, who serves as Snowden’s legal counsel. Apologizing for “hiccups” in the video, Wizner joked that they had attempted to shield the transmission’s source by bouncing it across proxy servers around the world.Google, Facebook, Yahoo and other Internet companies have already urged Congress to reform government spy policies. They also have beefed up encryption measures in the wake of news reports, based on documents leaked by Snowden, that described government efforts to weaken security standards and tap overseas data transmissions between computer centers.“His disclosures have improved Internet security,” said ACLU technology expert Christopher Soghoian, although he acknowledged, “there are going to be people in this audience who think that what Ed did is wrong.”Both Snowden and Soghoian said tech companies can do more to protect consumers who don’t have the tech savvy to use obscure software tools that encrypt or otherwise shield their data from prying eyes.Snowden also called on Internet companies to consider how long they retain users’ data, since extended stockpiling may create an attractive target for spy agencies. But in response to an audience question, Snowden said that despite concerns about companies like Google and Facebook, which gather lots of information about their users, he doesn’t consider them as threatening as government agencies that do the same.“The government has the ability to deprive you of your rights. They can literally kill you. They can jail you,” Snowden said. “Companies can surveil you to sell you products, they can sell your information to other companies,” he added, but consumers can sue for privacy violations or simply not use a company’s services.Snowden’s revelations have drawn criticism from officials who say they jeopardized national security. U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., an Army veteran, urged festival organizers to cancel the talk because it would encourage “the very lawlessness he exhibited.”But the SXSW audience applauded Snowden several times, including when Wizner read an email from Tim Berners-Lee, a respected computer scientist credited with inventing the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee wrote that Snowden’s leaks were “profoundly in the public interest.”Leading Internet companies declined to comment on Snowden’s remarks, but one industry group stressed the need for government action to restore trust in the Internet.“The only way to achieve meaningful surveillance reform, and preserve the openness of the Internet and the innovation economy that it drives, is to change the policies that authorize the bulk collection of individuals’ communications and add transparency to the oversight process,” said Christian Dawson of the Internet Infrastructure Coalition, who’s on a conference panel set to address the topic Tuesday.Snowden said he wanted to speak at SXSW because “the people in the audience right now, they’re the folks who can really fix things.”Referring to proposed legal reforms, he said: “There’s a policy response that needs to occur. But there’s also a technical response that needs to occur. And it’s the makers, it’s the thinkers and the development community that can craft solutions to make sure we’re safe.”Follow Brandon Bailey at Twitter.com/BrandonBailey or google.com/+BrandonBaileyOnline or on Facebook at http://on.fb.me/ULIOfb.

965	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — NSA leaker Edward Snowden spoke via live video conference Monday to a packed audience at the South By Southwest Interactive Festival.The former NSA contractor, who remains in Moscow living in temporary asylum, faces felony charges in the U.S. after revealing the agency’s mass surveillance program by leaking thousands of classified documents to media outlets.Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, spoke to Snowden from the Austin event along with Snowden’s legal adviser, the ACLU’s Ben Wizner.The hour-long conversation was extensive and Snowden touched on a number of issues. He dispensed advice on how U.S. citizens can keep their web-surfing activities more private by using a free service called Tor, which encrypts web traffic. He also called on the technology industry to create more software and services that help guard individual privacy.Snowden appeared to have no regrets about exposing the U.S. government’s surveillance methods.“I took an oath to support the Constitution, and I felt the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,” he told the audience.The ACLU offered a live blog of Snowden’s talk on its website and the Texas Tribune’s website hosted a live video stream.Fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke at the SXSW conference in a similar manner on Saturday.

968	"Edward Snowden made an appearance at SXSW in Austin on Monday morning - from Russia via seven proxies, that is.The former NSA contractor was the most talked-about guest at the Texas tech conference today, where he spoke via Google Hangouts to thousands of attendees.Snowden has no regrets about revealing NSA secrets to journalists last year before fleeing to Hong Kong and later, Russia, where he currently resides. ""Would I do this again? Absolutely yes,"" he told moderator Ben Wizner. ""Regardless of what happens to me, this is something we had a right to know.""Snowden had strong words for the NSA, which he accused of ""setting fire to the future of the Internet."" He appealed to the assembled tech community to build something that will help slow or even defeat mass surveillance. ""The people who are in this room right now, you guys are all the fire fighters and we need you to help us fix this,"" he said.The crowd was largely sympathetic to Snowden and he did not face any questions from those who believe he was in the wrong - like Rep.

And the people who are in this room now, you guys are all the firefighters. And we need you to help us fix this.”Snowden’s conversation with Ben Wizner, his lawyer and the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, and ACLU “technologist” Christopher Soghoian was enough of a draw to fill three separate auditoriums in the Austin Convention Centre, and was easily the hottest ticket thus far in a SXSW Interactive that’s been unduly preoccupied with matters of official secrecy and online security. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange already spoke via Skype with the conference on Saturday, for instance, while Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists to whom Snowden originally went with his story, was scheduled to address SXSW later on Monday from his own point of exile in Brazil.Snowden, who has been labelled a thief and a spy by the U.S. intelligence community and reactionary politicians such as Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo — who recently sent an open letter to SXSW calling Snowden a “traitor” and a “common criminal” and urging organizers to cancel his appearance — made it clear during his talk that he had no problem with targeted surveillance of suspected lawbreakers or terrorists. It’s the broad surveillance of ordinary citizens for no particular purpose other than to hoard “metadata” on their communications and online comings-and-goings that, to him, stands as a gross violation of the U.S. Constitution. And, he pointed out, no less than two separate White House investigations have found the NSA’s hoarding activities have failed to yield any useful information.“We’re monitoring everyone’s communications instead of suspects’ communications, and that lack of focus has caused us to miss leads that we should have acted on,” he said, noting that U.S. intelligence has in the recent past failed to act on warnings received from Russia about Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev and from the father of “underwear bomber” Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. “We didn’t follow up, we didn’t actually investigate this guy, we didn’t dedicate a team to figure out what was going on because we spent all this money and we spent all of this time hacking into Google and Facebook’s back ends to look at their databases. What did we get? We got nothing.”Major U.S. technology companies have been complicit in allowing this sort of spying to happen on such a large scale, both Snowden and Soghoian agreed, because they’ve failed to provide their users with adequate encryption protection for their everyday communications and transactions.Companies such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo are only just starting to make reliable encryption protections standard and automatic in their services, all three onstage noted, while encryption apps “made for geeks, by geeks” are generally far too complicated for most users to bother with. As Soghoian put it: “You have to choose between a service that’s easy to use and reliable and polished, or a service that is highly secure and impossible for the average person to use.”Were proper encryption software everywhere as a matter of course, not as an “afterthought,” mass surveillance of the sort perpetrated by the NSA would become far too unwieldy and expensive to do, Snowden argued. Intelligence agencies would, thus, have to become more selective with their targets — i.e., actually have a reason to delve into their phone and Internet activities — rather than socking everyone’s information away in a database in Maryland for an unspecified use to be determined at a later date.At the same time, he added, putting the focus on surveillance, or “offence,” rather than defence against possible cyber-attacks, has actually left the U.S. less secure, not more so. “A system that is designed to be surveilled is a target waiting to be attacked,” he said.To much applause, Soghoian credited Snowden’s contentious revelations about the NSA with bettering everyone’s Internet security by forcing the government to own up about its monitoring activities and “shaming” corporations into patching up the huge holes in their services.“There are going to be people in this audience and who are listening at home who think what Ed did is wrong, but let me be clear about one really important thing: his disclosures have improved Internet security,” he said. “The security improvements we’ve gotten haven’t just protected us from bulk government surveillance. They’ve protected us from hackers at Starbucks who are monitoring our wifi connections, they’ve protected us from stalkers and identity thieves and common criminals. “These companies should have been encrypting their communications before and they weren’t, and it really took, unfortunately, the largest and most profound whistleblower to get us to a point where these companies are prioritizing the security of their users’ communications . . . and we all have Ed to thank for this.”Snowden allowed himself a smile onscreen at the riot of applause and a quiet “thank you.” He was asked if he’d make all these sacrifices again if he could choose to do it all over again.“We’re in a more secure place, we have more secure communications and we’re going to have a better civic interaction as a result of understanding what’s been done . . . so when it comes to ‘Would I do this again, the answer is ‘absolutely yes,’” he said.Do you want to help shapethe Toronto Star's future?Join our team of readers who are passionate about journalism and share your views.         Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

970	 Edward Snowden on Monday advocated for better online security measures, speaking via Google Hangout at the South By Southwest Interactive conference in Austin.Snowden spoke  as part of an an American Civil Liberties Union panel, along with analysts Chris Soghoian and Ben Wizner. While the video and audio feed was choppy, Snowden’s message was clear.“They’re setting fire to the future of the Internet,” Snowden said of the National Security Agency. “We need public advocates. We need public oversight. Some way [to have] trusted figures, sort of civil rights champions to advocate for us, to protect the structure. How do we fix our oversight? How do we structure an oversight model that works? The key factor is accountability.”Snowden, a former NSA contractor who leaked agency documents to the media, said that America’s policies set a dangerous precedent for the entire world.“If we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government will accept that has green light to do the same,” he said.Speaking in front of a backdrop showing the U.S. Constitution, he spoke of feeling an obligation to defend a document he saw being “violated on a massive scale.”Snowden argued that NSA policies have harmed national security in an era of cyberattacks.“America has more to lose than anyone else when every attack succeeds,” Snowden said. “When you are the one country in the world who has sort of a vault that’s more full than anyone else’s, it doesn’t make sense for you to be attacking all day and never defending your full vault.”Snowden has generally remained in the background, perhaps not to distract from the debate on surveillance issues. He made an exception for SXSW, which has become a mecca for the tech community. It seemed an appropriate audience to advocate for end-to-end encryption to better protect user’s data.Snowden was greeted by applause when his face appeared on the massive screens, and he received a standing ovation from most of those gathered as the talk ended.VIDEO: Snowden: Hayden, Alexander have harmed Internet and national security: VIDEO: Snowden: ‘Overseers are not interested in oversight’: Security has been something of a theme at this year’s conference. On Saturday, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke via video conference from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and called on citizens to act against surveillance.“The ability to surveil everyone on the planet is almost there, and arguably will be there within a few years. That’s led to a huge transfer of power from the people who are surveilled upon to those who control the surveillance complex,” Assange said.Update: This post originally said that Snowden appeared through seven proxies. The author regrets missing the apparent joke and not having a better grasp of memes.	Science
971	"Edward Snowden has made a rare video appearance at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, condemning mass government surveillance and urging members of the tech-savvy audience to take action against it.Speaking from Russia, where he was granted asylum, the former intelligence contractor said proposed reforms at the US National Security Agency (NSA) show he was vindicated in leaking classified material.ReplayHe said he had no regrets about leaking classified information. Asked if he would leak secret government information again, he replied: ""absolutely, yes"".Internet firefighters""The Constitution was violated on a massive scale"": Edward Snowden.Snowden said the US government's mass surveillance failed to catch the Boston Marathon bombers and warned that governments have created an adversarial climate on the internet.""They're setting fire to the global internet, and you guys in the room are the global firefighters,"" Snowden said.He appeared against a backdrop of the US Constitution with ""We the people"" written in large letters. The video feed was broadcast on a large screen before several thousand credentialed festival attendees in two conference halls and streamed live online.""I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,"" Snowden said to applause, adding that his revelations of government spying on private communications have resulted in protections that have benefited the public and global society.Last year, Snowden, who had been working at an NSA facility as an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, leaked a raft of secret documents that revealed a vast US government system for monitoring phone and internet data.The leaks deeply embarrassed the Obama administration, which in January banned US eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly countries and allies and began reining in the sweeping collection of Americans' phone data in a series of limited reforms triggered by Snowden's revelations.Major companies also tightened up safeguards, but Snowden said that is still not enough to protect privacy properly, calling for stepped-up encryption that would make mass government surveillance too costly to conduct.""The government has gone and changed their talking points. They have changed their verbiage away from public interest to national interest,"" he said, adding that this poses the risk of losing control of representative democracy.He said the government's priority has been an expansive and ill-executed system of massive information collection instead of protecting the vast amounts of intellectual property that supports the US economy.""We've got the most to lose from being hacked,"" he said.Tech industrySnowden also called on the technology industry to become serious about protecting the privacy of its customers.He said the early technology adopters and entrepreneurs who travel to Austin every year for the event are ""the folks who can fix this and enforce our rights"". On stage while Snowden spoke were Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project and Snowden's legal adviser. All three men said that they wanted to raise a call to arms to developers and activists to build better tools to protect the privacy of technology users.Snowden said even the companies whose business models rely on collecting data about their users ""can still do this in a responsible way"".""It's not that you shouldn't collect the data,"" he said. ""But you should only collect the data and hold it as long as necessary.""Ultimately, the tech industry can help fix the problem, Soghoian said.""Most regular people are not going to download some obscure security app,"" he said. ""They're going to use the tools they already have,"" which include Google, Facebook and Skype.The technology community should pressure those companies to introduce security measures that are stronger and easier to use, Soghoian said.Government accountabilitySnowden took questions from moderators and those relayed from spectators around the world through tweets using the hashtag #asksnowden.The first question came from Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, who asked Snowden how he would create an accountability system for governance.""We have an oversight model that could work. The problem is when the overseers are not interested in oversight,"" Snowden said. ""The key factor is accountability.""""We need public advocates, public representatives, public oversight,"" he said, including ""a watchdog that watches Congress.""He believed the lack of accountability will have international consequences.""If we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government will accept that as a green light to do the same,"" he said.Soghoian praised Snowden for leaking evidence of government surveillance of private communications and holding the companies who were complicit accountable.""We have Ed to thank for that,"" he said, to loud applause.Whistleblower or criminal?Wizner noted during Snowden's appearance that Republican politician Mike Pompeo wrote to organisers beforehand urging them to cancel the event, saying ""the ACLU would surely concede that freedom of expression for Mr Snowden has declined since he left American soil.""""If there's one person for whom that is not true, it's Ed Snowden,"" Wizner said.Facing US felony charges of espionage and theft of government property, Snowden has kept a low profile of late and has said he won't return until the United States changes its whistleblower-protection laws.US Attorney General Eric H. Holder has taken a strong stand against granting amnesty to Snowden, saying he caused harm to national security and should be held accountable for his actions. Holder has described him as a defendant, not a whistleblower.Barton Gellman, a Washington Post reporter who has worked with Snowden, released a video of his own ahead of Snowden's appearance. He said Snowden wanted to speak with ""the people who are building and creating the next generation of the internet"" because ""technologists"" are ""a group he wants to influence"".""He's looking for places where there can be reform"" to ""practices that he regards as overbroad and overly-intrusive"", Gellman said.The annual South by Southwest Festival, or SXSW, draw tens of thousands of people to Austin, with privacy and government surveillance a focus for the tech crowd's five-day gathering this year.On Saturday, the festival hosted an hour-long video feed discussions with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who helped Snowden publish stolen NSA documents.Speaking over Skype from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Assange hinted at forthcoming leaks and blasted the Obama administration for not taking Snowden's revelations more seriously.Festival organisers added in a statement: ""SXSW agrees that a healthy debate with regards to the limits of surveillance is vital to the future of the online ecosystem.""Los Angeles Times, New York Times, ReutersFollow IT Pro on TwitterDelivered Mon–Fri.By signing up you accept our privacy policy and conditions of useCopyright © 2018"	Science

We haven’t heard from Edward Snowden in a while. The former NSA contractor does few interviews. But that changed in Austin, Texas, on Monday. Snowden joined a panel moderated by the American Civil Liberties Union at the SXSW Interactive Festival. He appeared on a video screen near an image of the constitution — in a packed exhibition hall, the largest at SXSW. The festival also simulcast his talk in several other locations. The crowd welcomed him like a rock star.“He took over Austin this morning,” says Steven Davy, the web editor for PRI's The World, who saw the presentation.Snowden was what people talked about between sessions and at the event's after-parties. “It was the whisper in the hallways. You know, Snowden, Snowden,” he says.The crowd was Snowden's type of people — the hackers, the people working on net neutrality and advocacy — according to Davy. A couple of times, the crowd interrupted him with applause during the session. Snowden even ended the panel like a rocker finishing a set: “Thank you! Thank you Austin!” he said.Davy says it’s hard to know if there were any dissenters in the crowd. The ACLU lobbed him softball questions, Davy notes, and the ones coming from Twitter didn’t seem to challenge what he did, either.For example, no one challenged him when he said the NSA missed its chance to prevent the Boston bombings, due to its preoccupation with collecting meta-data.Snowden sparked some strong reactions when he was asked about the future of the Internet. He says the NSA is setting fire to it — arguing that massive data collection will turn the Internet into a controlled universe where the giant tech companies collude with the NSA in all matters.Davy says the crowd listened attentively to his cautionary words. It is, after all, a group of people who care deeply about the Internet and its future.One more thing…PRI takes a global approach to the news of the day.

975	To say that Edward Snowden’s teleconference at South By Southwest this morning was an interview would be something of a stretch. He was beamed in from Russia to field questions from two ACLU activists in front of a roomful of tech-enthusiast SXSW attendees. His face was superimposed over a green screen of the Constitution, and the talk was peppered with quips for journalists and advertisements for Snowden’s cause: People working on encryption are practicing “Defense Against the Dark Arts for the digital realm.” The NSA is “setting fire to the future of the Internet,” he told the crowd. “The people that are in the room now, you guys are all the firefighters.”He went over his usual talking points—that the US needs “a watchdog that watches Congress,” that Google, Apple and their ilk are essentially “advertising companies” looking to capitalize on data. Snowden argued that the technology community needed to make sure that internet security could “pass the Glenn Greenwald test”—that is, be more accessible for people who don’t specialize in tech. This was the main criticism he or his moderators addressed: that the encryption technology was imperfect, that it needed improvement to get the public on board, that with enough innovation data could be easier to protect. Certainly the technology does need improvement. But that’s an insiders’ issue—and one that ignores the broader ethical questions that have arisen around Snowden. The focus on it bespeaks a disconnection from the public that Snowden’s supporters will have to learn how to grapple with if they want internet privacy to be anything other than a fringe issue.For the panel’s participants, privacy advocates had failed most grievously by not making encryption technology more accessible to average users. When one Twitter watcher asked what average users could do to make their data more secure, Snowden answered by giving a brief explanation of Tor, the data-encrypting software. Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer and a co-moderator of the event, elaborated: “When there’s a question about average users, and the answer is Tor, we’ve failed.”It’s not that this sort of softball interview is inherently a bad thing—and SXSW attendees are about as sympathetic an audience as Snowden is going to get. But in a conversation centered on technologists’ need to make their concerns more accessible to the public, neither Snowden or his moderators bothered to address the concerns of most of that public—only 31 percent of whom, according to a January poll conducted by CBS, approve of Snowden’s whistleblowing. The idea that the most serious issue for technologists to address is Tor’s usability is laughable—certainly that’s not the primary concern of the other 69 percent.From such a public venue as SXSW—more than 40,000 were watching the livestream at peak viewership—it makes sense for Snowden to address the criticisms levied towards him, like that he’s advocating for free speech from Russia, or that he’s done more harm to public security than good. These criticisms, common in public discussion of Snowden, barely came up in the interview. That’s not doing anyone any good.“Let me be clear about one thing,” Chris Soghoian, an ACLU activist and the panel’s other moderator told the crowd midway through the interview, “Ed’s disclosures have improved internet security.” The SXSW audience applauded wildly. But to put it bluntly, internet security is too abstract a concern to galvanize the general public—questions like “If I’m not doing anything wrong, why do I care if the NSA watches?” and  “How do I know the NSA is actually collecting my data?” abound, and it’s difficult to rally people against an invisible collections system and secret courts when there are countless more tangible issues in the press ever day. Snowden and his advocates have addressed these concerns, arguing, for example, that even White House investigations have found PRISM ineffective, or that focusing on offensive collection takes away from defensive resources. But they haven’t found a way to convince the broader public that this issue has relevance for them. When internet privacy advocates talk about “accessibility,” they shouldn’t just be thinking of how to make Tor easier to use—but rather how to frame spying in more concrete terms. It’s excellent that Edward Snowden is finding ways to make public appearances not mediated by journalists in interviews—that’s one good step towards humanizing his cause. The next is for him to start tackling more difficult questions head on.Copyright 2018 © New Republic. All rights reserved.	Science

                      Today NSA whistleblower (or leaker) Edward Snowden gave his first live video interview since taking refuge in Russia last year. He chose his audience carefully, too — but Uncommon Wisdom Daily had our own source in the room.
                    
                      Austin-based writer Patrick Watson has been covering the SXSW Interactive Festival for us since last week. He checked out several intriguing startup companies you may hear about in our research services soon.
                    
                      Patrick is already on-scene so I asked him to do some near-live reporting of Snowden’s session. We knew this would be national news.
                    
                      Rather than filter it through my own voice, I’m handing over the keyboard so Patrick can tell you what he saw and heard.
                    
                      ***
                    
Patrick: Thanks, Brad. The SXSW Interactive Festival is a major tech industry gathering with a reputation for launching great ideas. Privacy is a top theme this year.
                    
                      In addition to Snowden, I saw Google (GOOG) CEO Eric Schmidt on the hot seat over his own practices. I also saw WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange speak from his prison-like existence inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
                    
This Bloomberg story about the Snowden speech also mentions both Schmidt and Assange. Their reporting generally matches what I heard. It is a fair summary and I recommend you read it.

                      After a round of applause, Snowden said he chose SXSW for the appearance because he knew it would be an audience of young technology leaders. His goal is for them to ""recapture the Internet"" from governments and businesses that are hurting it.
                    
                      ***
                    
                      Snowden came back to that save-the-Internet theme repeatedly. He didn’t object to legitimate intelligence-gathering. In his view, that’s not what the National Security Agency is doing.
                    
                      He thinks that by weakening the encryption standards everyone relies on, the U.S. government actually exposed us to more danger.
                    
The audience very much liked this message. Snowden called on the young techies to stand up and make a difference. The ones seated around me were ready to do it.

                      Here is a graphical representation of Snowden’s remarks, compiled by an on-site illustrator.

                      Like Snowden, the people at this event want to defend the U.S. from real threats. Many companies at this show are pushing new privacy technologies that will help.
                    
                      With current technology, your Internet provider and various other links in the chain can easily intercept your data any time. Snowden wants to change the ""default"" switches to ""safe."" This won’t stop the NSA from legitimate activities; it will force them to focus on real threats.

                      Several speakers including Snowden said it is technically possible, right now, to encrypt data in ways even the NSA can’t penetrate. The challenge, he said, to make this kind of encryption seamless across the Internet and usable by regular people.
                    
                      Doing this will probably take years and I think it will spawn an entire new industry. Some of the pioneers are at this show, too. Most are not publicly traded stocks yet — but I have their names. I’ll watch them with interest.
                    
                      ***
                    
                      One last point: Snowden and others talked about the inherent contradiction between privacy and ""free"" advertising-supported online services.
                    
                      Google, Yahoo! (YHOO) and others are in the business of collecting your data. That’s how they make money. The same is true of Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), to a somewhat lesser degree.
                    
                      As Brad said last year, you are not Google’s customer. You are the product. There are no ""free"" lunches. You are giving them your eyeballs in exchange for those so-called free services.
                    
We should all re-think how we pay for online services if this is the case. We may not pay directly, but we are paying indirectly in ways we may not like.
                    
                      If you care about your privacy, you may need to accept that e-mail and Web browsers will cost you some real cash.
                    
                      It will be a big attitude adjustment for many of us. Now is a good time to get started.
                    
                      ***
                    
                      Wherever he was, Snowden’s background was an image of the U.S. Constitution. I’ve already read comments by people who are outraged. How can this ""traitor"" wrap himself in the flag, they say.
                    
                      What does Snowden himself say?
                    
                      He observed the government routinely violating the Constitutional rights of citizens on a massive scale. He knew someone needed to stop it, and none of his co-workers or managers was willing.
                    
                      Whether you call him hero or traitor, Snowden sincerely believes he was doing the right thing. He said today he would do it all again.
                    
                      There can be no doubt Snowden’s disclosures changed the landscape. If what I see at SXSW is any indication, Snowden also changed the world.
                    
Time will tell us if he changed it for good.

                      ***
                    
Brad: Thanks for your on-the-spot reporting, Patrick. You give us all a lot to consider.
                    
                      For everyone else, you can read more about Snowden and the other SXSW events Patrick attends on his Twitter feed, @PatrickW. I know his next stop after filing the story above was going to be Glenn Greenwald, the journalist whom Snowden first approached with his document trove.
                    
                      Like Assange and Snowden, Greenwald appeared at SXSW via video from another country (Brazil) outside the U.S. government’s reach. I don’t agree with everything these men have done, but I think it is sad they can’t speak their minds without fear of arrest.

What do you think of Edward Snowden? Will his disclosures ultimately help or hurt the cause of freedom? Will the technology industry really change? What kind of new world will the under-30 crowd see in the coming decades?

      Edward Snowden has made a rare video appearance at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, condemning mass government surveillance and urging members of the tech-savvy audience to take action against it.
  

      Speaking from Russia, where he was granted asylum, the former intelligence contractor said proposed reforms at the US National Security Agency (NSA) show he was vindicated in leaking classified material.
  

      He said he had no regrets about leaking classified information. Asked if he would leak secret government information again, he replied: ""absolutely, yes"".
  
INTERNET FIREFIGHTERS


      Snowden said the US government's mass surveillance failed to catch the Boston Marathon bombers and warned that governments have created an adversarial climate on the internet.
  

      ""They're setting fire to the global internet, and you guys in the room are the global firefighters,"" Snowden said.
  

      He appeared against a backdrop of the US Constitution with ""We the people"" written in large letters. The video feed was broadcast on a large screen before several thousand credentialed festival attendees in two conference halls and streamed live online.
  

      ""I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,"" Snowden said to applause, adding that his revelations of government spying on private communications have resulted in protections that have benefited the public and global society.
  

      Last year, Snowden, who had been working at an NSA facility as an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, leaked a raft of secret documents that revealed a vast US government system for monitoring phone and internet data.
  

      The leaks deeply embarrassed the Obama administration, which in January banned US eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly countries and allies and began reining in the sweeping collection of Americans' phone data in a series of limited reforms triggered by Snowden's revelations.
  

      Major companies also tightened up safeguards, but Snowden said that is still not enough to protect privacy properly, calling for stepped-up encryption that would make mass government surveillance too costly to conduct.
  

      ""The government has gone and changed their talking points. They have changed their verbiage away from public interest to national interest,"" he said, adding that this poses the risk of losing control of representative democracy.
  

      He said the government's priority has been an expansive and ill-executed system of massive information collection instead of protecting the vast amounts of intellectual property that supports the US economy.
  

      ""We've got the most to lose from being hacked,"" he said.
  
TECH INDUSTRY


      Snowden also called on the technology industry to become serious about protecting the privacy of its customers.
  

      He said the early technology adopters and entrepreneurs who travel to Austin every year for the event are ""the folks who can fix this and enforce our rights"". 
  

      On stage while Snowden spoke were Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project and Snowden's legal adviser. All three men said that they wanted to raise a call to arms to developers and activists to build better tools to protect the privacy of technology users.
  

      Snowden said even the companies whose business models rely on collecting data about their users ""can still do this in a responsible way"".
  

      ""It's not that you shouldn't collect the data,"" he said. ""But you should only collect the data and hold it as long as necessary.""
  

      Ultimately, the tech industry can help fix the problem, Soghoian said.
  

      ""Most regular people are not going to download some obscure security app,"" he said. ""They're going to use the tools they already have,"" which include Google, Facebook and Skype.
  

      The technology community should pressure those companies to introduce security measures that are stronger and easier to use, Soghoian said.
  
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY


      Snowden took questions from moderators and those relayed from spectators around the world through tweets using the hashtag #asksnowden.
  

      The first question came from Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, who asked Snowden how he would create an accountability system for governance.
  

      ""We have an oversight model that could work. The problem is when the overseers are not interested in oversight,"" Snowden said. ""The key factor is accountability.""
  

      ""We need public advocates, public representatives, public oversight,"" he said, including ""a watchdog that watches Congress.""
  

      He believed the lack of accountability will have international consequences.
  

      ""If we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government will accept that as a green light to do the same,"" he said.
  

      Soghoian praised Snowden for leaking evidence of government surveillance of private communications and holding the companies who were complicit accountable.
  

      ""We have Ed to thank for that,"" he said, to loud applause.
  
WHISTLEBLOWER OR CRIMIAL?


      Wizner noted during Snowden's appearance that Republican politician Mike Pompeo wrote to organisers beforehand urging them to cancel the event, saying ""the ACLU would surely concede that freedom of expression for Mr Snowden has declined since he left American soil.""
  

      ""If there's one person for whom that is not true, it's Ed Snowden,"" Wizner said.
  

      Facing US felony charges of espionage and theft of government property, Snowden has kept a low profile of late and has said he won't return until the United States changes its whistleblower-protection laws.
  

      US Attorney General Eric H Holder has taken a strong stand against granting amnesty to Snowden, saying he caused harm to national security and should be held accountable for his actions. Holder has described him as a defendant, not a whistleblower.
  

      Barton Gellman, a Washington Post reporter who has worked with Snowden, released a video of his own ahead of Snowden's appearance. He said Snowden wanted to speak with ""the people who are building and creating the next generation of the internet"" because ""technologists"" are ""a group he wants to influence"".
  

      ""He's looking for places where there can be reform"" to ""practices that he regards as overbroad and overly-intrusive"", Gellman said.
  

      The annual South by Southwest Festival, or SXSW, draw tens of thousands of people to Austin, with privacy and government surveillance a focus for the tech crowd's five-day gathering this year.
  

      On Saturday, the festival hosted an hour-long video feed discussions with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who helped Snowden publish stolen NSA documents.
  

      Speaking over Skype from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Assange hinted at forthcoming leaks and blasted the Obama administration for not taking Snowden's revelations more seriously.
  

      ""SXSW agrees that a healthy debate with regards to the limits of surveillance is vital to the future of the online ecosystem,"" festival organisers said in a statement.

982	"By Mike WardCaptionClose22. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden22. NSA whistleblower Edward SnowdenAUSTIN – National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden blasted the U.S. government Monday for ""setting fire to the future of the Internet"" with its massive data-collection program that has triggered a worldwide debate over online snooping.""The result has been an adversarial Internet,"" Snowden, speaking by video link from Russia where he was granted asylum from pending U.S. espionage charges last year, told attendees at the South by Southwest Interactive conference. ""It's nothing we asked for. ... It's not something we wanted.""""The people in this room are all firefighters,"" Snowden said. ""We all need your help to fix this.""Snowden challenged the tech community to bolster encryption software that will make Internet communications more secure, criticizing companies such as Google, Yahoo and others for not doing enough to protect customers' privacy because their business models were based on unsecured networking. ""The good news is that there are solutions,"" he said.Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union and a panelist at the forum, said U.S. firms that transmit ""need to lock things down ... We need to make services secure out of the box. It's going to require a rethink from developers.""Speaking in front of a backdrop displaying the U.S. Constitution, Snowden challenged U.S. lawmakers who claim his leaks of secret documents have damaged U.S. security. Instead, he insisted that his actions have improved it, along with championing the online privacy of U.S. citizens who he said should be able to open e-mails or take cell phone calls without fear of being monitored.Snowden contended U.S. interests have suffered ""tremendous intelligence failures because we've been monitoring everybody's communications rather than suspects,"" including tips concerning accused Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev and accused underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab that were never followed-up by authorities.""What did we get from bulk collections?"" Snowden said. ""We got nothing.""Snowden specifically criticized U.S. intelligence chief James Clapper for ""cheering"" on the NSA's data-collection program, rather than holding it accountable. ""The overseers aren't interested in oversight,"" he said.The session – moderated by Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy & Technology Project and Snowden's legal advisor – had been criticized in recent days by U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, who claimed Snowden's ""only apparent qualification is his willingness to steal from his own government and then flee to that beacon of First Amendment freedoms, the Russia of Vladimir Putin.""Snowden's appearance at SXSW comes after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange gave a similar video speech to the conference on Saturday from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has sought asylum because of an ongoing investigation into unrelated sexual assault allegations. WikiLeaks earlier made public thousands of secret U.S. documents."	Science

Sign up nowAnthony Caruana (CSO Online) on 11 March, 2014 09:00From his hideout in Russia, where he is seeking asylum following his incredible revelations, former CIA employee and NSA contractor Edward Snowden addressed the crowd at the SXSW conference.Despite a letter from a senator in Kansas asking the SXSW conference organisers to uninvite Snowden, he appeared via Google Hangouts through seven different proxies. Snowden's advice to the crowd was clear – encrypt everything.Snowden conceded that encryption tools are simply too difficult for most people to use. While espousing that we should encrypt hard disks, networks and email he said that the technology community can overcome those challenges. He also suggested using anti-tracking software and tools like TOR.""South by Southwest and the tech community, the people in the room in Austin, they're the folks who can fix this. There's a political response that needs to occur, but there's also a tech response that needs to occur.""Snowden's answer to the widespread surveillance employed by the NSA is simple. Make it as hard as possible for someone to snoop. He said that the NSA still has no idea what documents he has actually handed over to journalists because of the encryption he employed.Snowden told the audience of 3000 assembled in the auditorium at the Austin Conference Center in Texas that he decided to address technologists in the first instance rather than policy makers because ""they are able to enforce technical standards even when congress hasn’t gotten to the point of creating legislation to protect our rights"".With the US Constitution as his backdrop, Snowden reiterated that he would repeat his actions if he had the same opportunities as he saw his actions as critical for protecting the privacy of ordinary citizens.""I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. And I saw the Constitution was being violated on a massive scale,"" he said.Snowden noted that the surveillance activities of the NSA are not just an American issue but that they affect the whole world, such is the breadth and depth of the NSA's actions.""This is a global issue. They are setting fire to the future of the Internet,"" he said. ""And the people is this room now – you guys are the firefighters"".Towards the end of his hour-long speech, Snowden noted that despite the NSA's monitoring activities, there have been some significant intelligence failures, citing the example of the Boston Marathon bombings.""We've actually had tremendous intelligence failures because we're monitoring the Internet, instead of suspects' communications,"" he said.Snowden took questions from the floor and through Twitter. The first came via email from Tim Berners-Lee who as what he would change about the United States surveillance systems.""We need public oversight. Some way for trusted public figures to advocate for us. We need a watchdog that watches Congress, because if we're not informed, we can't consent to these policies.""YouTube vide of Snowden's Presentation (note that the audio quality is poor and the video is choppy)

986	"Video Irony meters exploded when NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, addressing the SXSW conference via video link today, urged programmers to encrypt their data to protect it from, er, prying eyes.Snowden wraps himself in US constitutionsSnowden, a former CIA technician, addressed the audience in Austin, Texas, in a live broadcast using Google Hangouts, given the web giant's involvement with surveillance of the population. He claimed government spies were ""setting fire to the future of the internet.""But the SXSW organizers joked that Snowden's video signal, presumably originating from somewhere in Russia, was being bounced off ""seven different proxies"" before hitting the Chocolate Factory's video chat software. In an hour-long session, Snowden discussed the state of surveillance, how it could be countered, and took questions from the public – including a query from Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who asked for the ""privilege"" of the first question.""Your actions were profoundly in public interest. If you could design a system from scratch, an accountability system for governance over national security agencies, what would you do,"" the World Wide Web creator asked during the webcast's Q&A.""It's clear that intelligence agencies are going to be using the internet to collect information from all of us, is there any way we can make oversight more accountable and improved?""Snowden said there were technological measures that could be used – tools to encrypt communications and thwart tracking, for example – but the biggest issue was in layer eight of the network: in other words, the difficulty in getting ordinary people to use technology effectively and the politics preventing that from happening. Crypto and privacy systems are useless if humans won't, can't or are forbidden from using them properly.As an example of the political problem, the whistleblower highlighted the fact that the US director of national intelligence James Clapper misled US Congress and suffered no rebuke. Snowden accused congressional overseers of failing to protect privacy and ""cheerleading for the NSA.""What was needed, he said, was for independent public figures to have an oversight role in the intelligence community. They are needed to scrutinize spies and Congress, and make sure they are being honest. But internet users need to be responsible, too.On a most basic level, the only way forward to combat mass surveillance is for a corresponding mass encryption of data, Snowden said. The NSA has poured money into cracking algorithms and protocols, and has managed to subvert a few too, but the agency was thwarted by the sound mathematics at the heart of every good cipher; strong cryptography exists and should be relied upon.Snowden said that strong crypto will hold until ""concepts of mathematics and physics change on a fundamental level.""He advised netizens to ensure their hard drives and all their network connections are securely encrypted end to end so as to avoid mass surveillance. Doing so would force government eavesdroppers to focus on compromising particular targets rather than operate today's planet-wide dragnets, which effortlessly pull in pretty much everyone's unprotected internet traffic – whether or not they were suspected of any wrongdoing.Ciphering everything would derail that approach by making it too costly or too much hassle for government snoopers.Thus, while almost no one can stop the NSA actively hacking your PC and stealing your secret keys, he said, just adding basic encryption on a mass scale could vastly improve the situation for millions of spied-upon innocents. And that needs developers to step up to the plate.""There's a technical response that needs to occur. It's the makers, it's the thinkers, it's the development community that can really craft the systems to make sure we're safe,"" Snowden told the conference. ""This is a global issue. They are setting fire to the future of the internet and the people who are in this room now are the firefighters and we need you to help us fix this.""Developers can help enforce standards of privacy even though the US Congress hasn’t got around to enforcing them, Snowden said. Software needs to pass a Glen Greenwald stupidity test, the ex-contractor added, referring to the careful coaching he had to give the journalist in how to communicate securely using PGP before he could leak a cache of top-secret documents about the US and UK's online surveillance programs.""This is something people have to be able to access and really the way we interact with it now is not good,"" Snowden said.""If you have to go to the command line people aren’t going to use it. If you have to go three menus deep, people aren’t going to use it. It has to be out there, has to happen automatically, and it has to happen seamlessly.""

987	To say that Edward Snowden’s teleconference at South By Southwest this morning was an interview would be something of a stretch. He was beamed in from Russia to field questions from two ACLU activists in front of a roomful of tech-enthusiast SXSW attendees. His face was superimposed over a green screen of the Constitution, and the talk was peppered with quips for journalists and advertisements for Snowden’s cause: People working on encryption are practicing “Defense Against the Dark Arts for the digital realm.” The NSA is “setting fire to the future of the Internet,” he told the crowd. “The people that are in the room now, you guys are all the firefighters.”He went over his usual talking points—that the US needs “a watchdog that watches Congress,” that Google, Apple and their ilk are essentially “advertising companies” looking to capitalize on data. Snowden argued that the technology community needed to make sure that internet security could “pass the Glenn Greenwald test”—that is, be more accessible for people who don’t specialize in tech. This was the main criticism he or his moderators addressed: that the encryption technology was imperfect, that it needed improvement to get the public on board, that with enough innovation data could be easier to protect. Certainly the technology does need improvement. But that’s an insiders’ issue—and one that ignores the broader ethical questions that have arisen around Snowden. The focus on it bespeaks a disconnection from the public that Snowden’s supporters will have to learn how to grapple with if they want internet privacy to be anything other than a fringe issue.For the panel’s participants, privacy advocates had failed most grievously by not making encryption technology more accessible to average users. When one Twitter watcher asked what average users could do to make their data more secure, Snowden answered by giving a brief explanation of Tor, the data-encrypting software. Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer and a co-moderator of the event, elaborated: “When there’s a question about average users, and the answer is Tor, we’ve failed.”It’s not that this sort of softball interview is inherently a bad thing—and SXSW attendees are about as sympathetic an audience as Snowden is going to get. But in a conversation centered on technologists’ need to make their concerns more accessible to the public, neither Snowden or his moderators bothered to address the concerns of most of that public—only 31 percent of whom, according to a January poll conducted by CBS, approve of Snowden’s whistleblowing. The idea that the most serious issue for technologists to address is Tor’s usability is laughable—certainly that’s not the primary concern of the other 69 percent.From such a public venue as SXSW—more than 40,000 were watching the livestream at peak viewership—it makes sense for Snowden to address the criticisms levied towards him, like that he’s advocating for free speech from Russia, or that he’s done more harm to public security than good. These criticisms, common in public discussion of Snowden, barely came up in the interview. That’s not doing anyone any good.“Let me be clear about one thing,” Chris Soghoian, an ACLU activist and the panel’s other moderator told the crowd midway through the interview, “Ed’s disclosures have improved internet security.” The SXSW audience applauded wildly. But to put it bluntly, internet security is too abstract a concern to galvanize the general public—questions like “If I’m not doing anything wrong, why do I care if the NSA watches?” and  “How do I know the NSA is actually collecting my data?” abound, and it’s difficult to rally people against an invisible collections system and secret courts when there are countless more tangible issues in the press ever day. Snowden and his advocates have addressed these concerns, arguing, for example, that even White House investigations have found PRISM ineffective, or that focusing on offensive collection takes away from defensive resources. But they haven’t found a way to convince the broader public that this issue has relevance for them. When internet privacy advocates talk about “accessibility,” they shouldn’t just be thinking of how to make Tor easier to use—but rather how to frame spying in more concrete terms. It’s excellent that Edward Snowden is finding ways to make public appearances not mediated by journalists in interviews—that’s one good step towards humanizing his cause. The next is for him to start tackling more difficult questions head on.Copyright 2018 © New Republic. All rights reserved.	Science

990	"    NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden speaks via videoconference at the “Virtual Conversation With Edward Snowden” during the 2014 SXSW Music, Film + Interactive Festival at the Austin Convention Cente. Photograph: Michael Buckner/Getty Images for SXSWNational Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden urged delegates at a Texas technology conference to “fix” mass surveillance and warned that the spying was “setting fire to the future of the internet.”Mr Snowden, speaking via videolink from Russia where has been granted temporary asylum, said that he had no regrets over leaking details of mass electronic eavesdropping by the US spying agency.“Would I do it again? Absolutely. Regardless of what happens to me, this is something we had a right to,” he told the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin appearing on video screens.“I took an oath to support and defend the constitution, and I saw the constitution was being violated on a massive scale,” he said in response to questions from American Civil Liberties Union lawyers.Mr Snowden said the changes the American government and private companies have made about managing massive amounts of data helped vindicate his leaks of classified material.The leaks deeply embarrassed the Obama administration, which in January banned US eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly countries and allies and began reining in the sweeping collection of Americans‘ phone data in a series of limited reforms triggered by Snowden‘s revelations.Major companies also tightened up safeguards, but Mr Snowden said that is still not enough to protect privacy properly.“The government has gone and changed their talking points. They have changed their verbiage away from public interest to national interest,“ he said, adding that this poses the risk of losing control of representative democracy.Speaking to a sympathetic and tech-savvy crowd, Mr Snowden added that the US government still has no idea what material he has provided to journalists.Last year, Mr Snowden, who had been working at a National Security Agency facility as an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, leaked a raft of secret documents that revealed a vast US government system for monitoring phone and Internet data.To many in government and at the National Security Agency, Mr Snowden is a traitor who compromised the security of the United States. But for many at the conference he is a hero who protected privacy and civil liberties.Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo, a Republican, had called on the annual festival to cancel Mr Snowden’s appearance branding him a “traitor” and “common criminal” over his leaks.“To me, Snowden is a patriot who believed that what he did was in the best interests of his country,“ said Roeland Stekelenburg, a creative director at the Dutch Internet firm Infostrada. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he currently has asylum. The White House wants him returned to the United States for prosecution.

	AUSTIN, Texas -- NSA leaker Edward Snowden, speaking via live video conference Monday, told a packed audience at the South By Southwest Interactive Festival that he had no regrets and acted because he believed the U.S. Constitution had been ""violated on a massive scale.""
	The former NSA contractor, who remains in Moscow living in temporary asylum, faces felony charges in the U.S. after revealing the agency's mass surveillance program by leaking thousands of classified documents to media outlets.
	Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, spoke to Snowden from the Austin event along with Snowden's legal adviser, the ACLU's Ben Wizner.
	Snowden touched on a number of issues in the hour-long conversation. He dispensed advice on how U.S. citizens can keep their web-surfing activities more private by using a free service called Tor, which encrypts web traffic. He also called on the technology industry to create more software and services that help guard individual privacy.
	He appeared to have no regrets about exposing the U.S. government's surveillance methods.
	""And when it comes to would I do this again, the answer is absolutely yes,"" he told the audience.
	""I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I saw that the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,"" he added.
	The ACLU offered a live blog of Snowden's talk on its website and the Texas Tribune's website hosted a live video stream.
	Fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke at the SXSW conference in a similar manner on Saturday. Assange is living in asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
	Documents released over the past year by Snowden have revealed that the NSA sweeps up millions of Americans' phone and Internet records. The subsequent controversy has led President Barack Obama to ask agencies and Congress to consider some reforms.
	On Monday, Germany dismissed a claim by Snowden that it had buckled under American demands that it undermine privacy rights for German citizens.
	Snowden, in a statement published Friday, told the European Parliament that Germany was pressured to modify its legislation on wiretapping and other forms of lawful telecoms surveillance. He didn't elaborate on how the laws were changed or when, but suggested it was standard practice for the NSA to instruct friendly nations on how to ""degrade the legal protections of their countries' communications.""
	Last week, the top U.S. military officer said it would take two years of study and billions of dollars to overcome the loss of security to military operations and tactics that were revealed in the massive stash of documents taken by Snowden.AdvertisementUse of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy© 2018  All rights reserved.Back to top"	Science

Speaking to the audience at SXSW via Google Hangout, whistleblower Edward Snowden says his revelations sparked necessary debate on surveillance     SURVEILLANCE DEBATE. Whistleblower Edward Snowden addresses the SXSW crowd via Google Hangout. Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images/AFPSURVEILLANCE DEBATE. Whistleblower Edward Snowden addresses the SXSW crowd via Google Hangout. Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images/AFPWASHINGTON DC, USA - Former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden said Monday, March 10 he does not regret his leaks about mass surveillance programs, saying it sparked a needed public debate on spying and data collection.Snowden, who spoke via Google Hangout from Russia to the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, said he revealed the programs of the US National Security Agency (NSA) and other such services to foster ""a better civic understanding"" about what had been secret programs.He said his decision to leak documents to journalists ""wasn't so I could single handedly change the government; what I wanted to do was inform the public so they could provide their consent to what we should do.""Snowden, a former NSA contractor who has been in hiding in Russia and has been charged in the United States with espionage, maintained ""every society in the world has benefited"" from the debate on surveillance.""Regardless of what happens to me, this is something we have a right to know,"" he said on the link with members of the American Civil Liberties Union, who noted that the hookup was routed through seven proxy servers to keep his location secure.Snowden, who appeared against a backdrop of a giant copy of the US constitution, said the NSA programs have fundamentally altered the rights outlined in the charter.""The interpretation of the constitution has been changed from 'no unreasonable searches and seizures,' to 'any seizure is fine, just don't search it,'"" he said.Snowden said he chose to speak to SXSW because he believes it is important to encourage technology companies to make changes to stem mass surveillance.""The people who are in the room in Austin right now, they are the folks who can really fix things through technical standards,"" he said.Snowden said more companies should adopt robust encryption that is built into communications without users having to use complex technical tools.He maintained that if encryption is too complex, ""people aren't going to use it; it has to happen automatically, it has to happen seamlessly.""If online communications are fully encrypted at all stages, Snowden said, bulk data collection would become too difficult for intelligence agencies.He also said the NSA and other agencies have devoted too many resources to this type of bulk collection and not enough to traditional methods to catch criminals and terrorists.""We've had tremendous intelligence failures because we are monitoring everybody's communications, instead of suspects,"" he said.He cited the Boston marathon bombings as an example, saying ""if we hadn't spent so much on mass surveillance, if we followed traditional models, we might have caught"" the suspects.Congress needs watchdogSnowden also entertained questions. One of them came via Twitter from Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, who thanked Snowden and asked how to make an intelligence oversight system more accountable.Snowden said ""the key factor is accountability"" and that Congress needed a watchdog because it failed to adequately oversee the NSA. READ RELATED: Obama to unveil NSA reforms, response to Snowden""We can't have officials who can lie to the Congress and not face any consequences,"" he said. ""We need a watchdog that watches Congress.""Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed widespread surveillance of individuals and institutions in the United States and around the world.He received temporary asylum in Russia in August - a move that infuriated the United States and was a key factor behind President Barack Obama's decision to cancel a summit with counterpart Vladimir Putin last year. – Rappler.com

999	"Calling internet-based spying “the dark arts,” NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden said the practice of mass electronic surveillance is ineffective and resources would be better spent on targeted surveillance.  The NSA failed to identify the Boston Marathon bomber plot as well as apparently failing to detect Russia’s Ukrainian invasion and has yet to produce any information in the Malaysian airliner disappearance, based on reports.Against a backdrop of the US Constitution, Snowden spoke via video to a tech-savvy audience in Austin, TX attending the South by Southwest festival and warned government mass surveillance has created an adversarial climate on the internet.  “They’re setting fire to the global Internet, and you guys in the room (the tech savvy) are the global firefighters,” Snowden said.Snowden spoke via a video broadcast from Russia, where he was given asylum.  In the US he faces felony charges of espionage and theft of government property for leaking reams of documents to journalists that exposed the NSA’s mass surveillance programs.  U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder takes a strong stance against granting amnesty to Snowden, claiming he caused harm to national security and should be held accountable for his actions. Holder has described him as a defendant, a lawbreaker, not a whistle-blower.His life turned upside down, Snowden says he won’t return until the United States changes its whistle-blower-protection laws while he remains defiant, saying he would do it again.  “I took an oath to support the Constitution, and I felt the Constitution was violated on a massive scale,” Snowden said. “We’re going to have a better civic interaction as a result of understanding what’s being done in our name. If we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government will accept that as a green light to do the same.”Snowden’s first question came from Timothy John Berners-Lee, a British scientist credited as an inventor of the World Wide Web, who asked Snowden about accountability for oversight.  “We have an oversight model that could work. The problem is when the overseers are not interested in oversight,” Snowden said, noting that a lack of accountability will have international consequences. “The key factor is accountability. We need public advocates, public representatives, public oversight,” including “a watchdog that watches Congress.”In the question period, Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, expressed appreciation to Snowden for leaking evidence of government mass surveillance and blowing the whistle on private companies complicit.  “We have Ed to thank for that,” he said, to loud applause.Snowden also shared advice about how citizens can protect themselves online. “There are basic steps” to take, including using full disk encryption, network encryption via SSL, browser plug-ins such as NoScript and cookie-blockers, and the Tor anonymization service.Get our newsletter and our in-depth investor case studies all for free!
